    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team to focus on: In this case, the team of interest is the Colorado Avalanche since the claim mentions \"Colorado\" implicitly by naming their opponents (the New York Islanders). However, the table doesn't explicitly mention the teams as part of the Colorado Avalanche.\n\n2. Find all games against the New York Islanders: In our table, there is only one game against the New York Islanders (row 0), with Raycroft as the goalie and an attendance of 11298 people.\n\n3. Determine if this is the second lowest attendance for March 2009: To find the second lowest attendance, we need to compare the attendance of all games played by the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009. In our table, there are no dates explicitly mentioned as being from March 2009; however, we can assume that the games are arranged chronologically and since March has 31 days, it's reasonable to consider the entire dataset as representing March 2009 (assuming one game per day).\n\n4. Compare attendances: To find the second lowest attendance, we need to look for lower values than the 11298 attendees at the New York Islanders game. In our table, there are 3 games with lower attendances: 13608 (row 3), 13612 (row 4), and 13612 (row 9) attended the Atlanta Thrashers, Atlanta Thrashers again, and Edmonton Oilers games respectively.\n\n5. Conclusion: Since there are only three attendances lower than the game against the New York Islanders, and all of them were at the same attendance value (13612), we cannot definitively say that this is the second lowest attendance for March 2009.
