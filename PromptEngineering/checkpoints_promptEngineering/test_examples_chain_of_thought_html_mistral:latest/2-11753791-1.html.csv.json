    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify all teams in the table.\n2. Check each team's games played (column 2) to see if they have played 8 games. This is because the claim only pertains to teams that have played 8 games.\n3. For each team that has played 8 games, check their losses (column 3). If a team has 3 losses, move on to step 4.\n4. Check for ties (column 5) for the team with 3 losses.\n5. If there are any rows where the number of losses is 3 and the number of ties is not 0, then the claim is FALSE.\n6. If all teams with 3 losses have a value of 0 in the ties column, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify all teams\", \"Check games played for each team\", \"Filter for teams with 8 games played\", \"Check losses for filtered teams\", \"Check ties for teams with 3 losses\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ties\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"losses\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"losses\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ties\" }\n  ]\n}",
