Identify the claim: The claim states that \"beach break live\" or \"cone timentrate design\" was invested in by Peter Jones with a money request greater than 35000.\n\n2. Iterate through the table and find the rows that match either \"beach break live\" or \"cone timentrate design\".\n\n   For \"beach break live\":\n      - Find the row where \"company or product name\" equals \"beach break live\". The relevant cell is: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"}\n      - Check if the investing dragon(s) for this episode include Peter Jones. The relevant cell is: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"}\n      - Check if the money requested is greater than 35000.

Compare the amounts found in step 3 for the relevant rows to determine which one is the highest.\n5.
