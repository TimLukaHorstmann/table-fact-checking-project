Compare the best times of drivers from each shortlisted team. For n/h/l racing, both Sebastien Bourdais (58.596) and Graham Rahal (58.485) have better times than any other driver in the table.

We can do this by checking the 'team' column for rows where the value is 'n / h / l racing'. In this table, there are two such rows: 2nd and 5th.\n\n2. Next, we need to find their respective qualification times. These are in the 'qual 1' and 'qual 2' columns for each driver. For the 2nd row (Sebastien Bourdais), the qual times are 58.709 and 58.596. For the 5th row (Graham Rahal), the qual times are 59.112 and 58.485.\n\n3. The claim states that 'n / h / l racing fail to qualify any driver for the 2007 rexall grand prix of edmonton'. To determine if this is true, we need to check if there are any times within the qualification time limit. In this race, a driver was considered to have failed to qualify if their best time exceeded 1:01.000 (61 seconds).\n\n4. We will now compare each driver's best qualifying time with the limit of 1:01.000. For Sebastien Bourdais, his best time is 58.596, which is less than 1:01.000. For Graham Rahal, his best time is also less than 1:01.000 (58.485).\n\n5. Since both drivers from 'n / h / l racing' have best qualifying times that are within the limit, it means that they did qualify for the 2007 rexall grand prix of edmonton.
