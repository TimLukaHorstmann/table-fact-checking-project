For North Melbourne, the away score is found in the second row of the table:\n   - The home team in this row is \"hawthorn\", but since we're looking for North Melbourne (the away team), we skip this row.\n   - The home team in the third row is \"essendon\", and the away team score here is 13.16 (94). Since this isn't North Melbourne, we skip this row as well.\n   - The home team in the fourth row is \"collingwood\", and the away team score here is 5.10 (40).
