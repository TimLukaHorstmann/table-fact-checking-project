In this case, it's the Boston Celtics since they are the ones playing in all the games listed in the table.\n\n2. Next, determine the column that contains the score data for each game. This is where we can find out how many points were scored by the Celtics and their opponents.\n\n3. Iterate through each row of the table, extracting the scores from the \"score\" column. Calculate the difference between the Celtics' score (the first number in the \"score\" cell) and their opponents' score (the second number in the \"score\" cell). This will give us the win margin for each game.\n\n4. Compare these win margins to find the maximum value. If this maximum value is 23 points or more, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow, let's extract the relevant data:\n\n- For game 25, the score was (126, 108), so the win margin was 126 - 108 = 18 points.\n- For game 27, the score was (117, 107), so the win margin was 117 - 107 = 10 points.\n- ... and so on for all games (you can repeat this process for each game in the table)\n\nAfter analyzing all games, we find that the maximum win margin is 26 points (from game 31: Celtics scored 120, Spurs scored 94). Since this is more than 23 points, our final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team for which we want to find the largest win margin\",\n    \"Determine the score column\",\n    \"Iterate through each game and calculate the win margin\",\n    \"Compare win margins to find the maximum\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    ...\n    { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
