    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim's key components: The claim states that there is only one defensive tackle (position) with a pick number of 19 (overall).\n\n2. Scan the table for relevant rows based on the position \"defensive tackle\". There is only one row where the position column contains \"defensive tackle\", which is the second row with a pick number of 19 and an overall number of 83.\n\n3. Check if the pick number (overall) 19 appears elsewhere in the table for a different position. After checking, we find that there is another row where the pick number is 19, but it is associated with the linebacker position (first row). However, since the claim specifies \"defensive tackle\", this row does not meet the condition of being relevant to the claim.\n\n4. Compare the number of rows matching the criteria (\"defensive tackle\" and pick number 19) with the claim (\"there is only one defensive tackle with a pick number of 19\"). Since there is only one such row, it matches the claim.\n\n5. Based on our findings, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key components of the claim: pick number 19 and position 'defensive tackle'\",\n    \"Scan table for rows matching the 'defensive tackle' condition\",\n    \"Find one row where both conditions are met (pick number = 19 and position = defensive tackle)\",\n    \"Check if there are any other rows with pick number 19 but a different position. There is another row but it is not relevant to the claim since it has a different position.\",\n    \"Compare the number of matching rows with the claim (there should be only one). The number of matching rows matches the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
