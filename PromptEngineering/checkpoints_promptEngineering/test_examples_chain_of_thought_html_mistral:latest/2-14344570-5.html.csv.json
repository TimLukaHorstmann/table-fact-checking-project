However, the table does not contain any data for the Philadelphia Flyers.\n2. Next, check if any team tied with Colorado Avalanche, which is a team present in the table.\n3. Since there are multiple games between different teams and the Colorado Avalanche, it's necessary to analyze each game played by the Colorado Avalanche in the table to determine if there was a tie.\n4. The first step would be to look for ties (2 - 2 ot or similar scores) among the Colorado Avalanche games, as these are potential candidates for a tie match.\n5. In the table, we find that the Colorado Avalanche had two overtime ties: one with game ID 41 on January 4 and another with game ID 24 on January 24 (rows 2 and 7).\n6. Since our claim specifically mentions January 4, we need to focus on the game on that date. The game on January 4 was between Colorado Avalanche and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, not Philadelphia Flyers.\n7. Therefore, there is no entry in this table that matches the given claim about the Philadelphia Flyer tying the Colorado Avalanche on January 4, 1996.\n\nFinally, my output will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team involved in the claim (Philadelphia Flyers)\",\n    \"Check if any team tied with Colorado Avalanche\",\n    \"Analyze each game played by the Colorado Avalanche to determine a potential tie\",\n    \"Look for ties (2 - 2 ot or similar scores) among the Colorado Avalanche games\",\n    \"Focus on the specific date mentioned in the claim (January 4)\",\n    \"Compare the teams involved in each January 4 game with Colorado Avalanche\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n  ]\n}",

However, there's no row in the table for the Philadelphia Flyers, so it seems that they didn't play any game within the provided date range.\n2. Cross-check the given date range: The dates in the table go from January 3rd to February 28th (46 days). Since there are 49 rows in the table and each row represents a game, it appears that some games may be missing or repeated for other teams. This could make the analysis inconclusive if the Philadelphia Flyers played outside this date range.\n3. Check for overtime games: To check whether any team went into overtime more than once, we can look at the 'ot' column and count the number of overtime games for each team. We find that some teams had multiple overtime games (e.g., the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the New York Rangers both had 2).\n4. Conclusion: Without knowing the exact number of overtime games the Philadelphia Flyers played, it's impossible to verify whether they went into overtime in 6 games or not. However, since there is no row for the Philadelphia Flyers in this table, it seems that they didn't play any game within the given date range (which may be incorrect).\n\nFinal answer: {\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team in question (Philadelphia Flyers),\"\n                       \"Cross-check the given date range,\"\n                       \"Check for overtime games per team,\"\n                       \"Conclusion: Without knowing the exact number of overtime games the Philadelphia Flyers played, it's impossible to verify whether they went into overtime in 6 games or not.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"INVALID\"\n}",

This would help us identify the relevant team playing on that date.\n  2. If a row with game='48' exists, check if the 'opponent' column in that row contains the name 'Philadelphia Flyers'.
