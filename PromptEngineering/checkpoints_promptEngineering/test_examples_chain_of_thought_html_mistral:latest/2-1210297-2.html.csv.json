Compare the dates to determine if one ship was laid down a month before the other. The date for hasty is '15 april 1935' and for havock it's '15 may 1935'.

    "resp": "Reasoning Steps:\n1. Identify the ships mentioned in the claim, which are 'havock' and 'hasty'.\n2. Locate the respective rows of these ships in the table. The row index for 'havock' is 2 and for 'hasty' is 1.\n3. Extract the 'launched' date (column) for each ship. For 'havock', it's '7 july 1936'. For 'hasty', it's '5 may 1936'.\n4. Calculate the number of days between the launch dates by finding the difference between them. We can do this by subtracting the earlier date (hasty) from the later date (havock). This calculation gives us 78 days (July 7 - May 5 = 92 days, but we want days only, so we ignore the year and months).\n5. Compare the calculated number of days with the claim that 'havock' was launched 8 months and 2 days after 'hasty'. Since our calculation shows that 'havock' was launched 78 days after 'hasty', we need to determine if 78 days is within the range of 8 months and 2 days.\n6. Convert 8 months into days by multiplying the number of months (8) by the average number of days in a month (30.43, assuming an average month of 30 days and adding the remaining 0.43 for the extra days). This gives us 243.84 days (8 * 30.43 + 2).\n7. Add 2 days to the total calculated in step 6 to account for the claim's \"and 2 days\". This gives us a total of 245.84 days.\n8. Compare our calculated number (78 days) with the expected number (245.84 days). Since 78 is less than 245.84, we can conclude that 'havock' was launched within the claimed time frame of 8 months and 2 days after 'hasty'.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify ships in claim\",\n    \"Locate respective rows for ships in table\",\n    \"Extract launch dates from table\",\n    \"Calculate number of days between launch dates\",\n    \"Compare calculated number with claimed time frame\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"launched\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"launched\" }\n  ]\n}",
