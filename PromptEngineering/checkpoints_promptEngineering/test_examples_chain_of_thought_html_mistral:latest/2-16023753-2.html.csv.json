Count the number of wins and losses: In the table, count the total number of wins (rows with a 'w' in the \"result\" column) and losses (rows with a non-win result, e.g., 'l') for each team.\n\n4. Compare the counts to the claim: If the total count of wins is equal to 12 and the total count of losses is equal to 4, then the Dolphins finished the regular season with a 12-4 record (as stated in the claim).
