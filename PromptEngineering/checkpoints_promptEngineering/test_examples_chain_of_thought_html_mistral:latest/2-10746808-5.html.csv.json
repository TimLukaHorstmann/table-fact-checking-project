Check the table for each game involving the mentioned teams on the specified date (29 May 1926): In the table, there are six rows corresponding to games played on that date. By scanning through these rows, we find that both Melbourne and Richmond, as well as South Melbourne and North Melbourne, have a game recorded for that day.\n\n3. Extract scores for each game: From the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns of the table, we see that in the first row (Melbourne vs. Richmond), Melbourne scored 19.8 (122) and Richmond scored 12.17 (89). In the third row (South Melbourne vs. North Melbourne), South Melbourne scored 10.15 (75) while North Melbourne scored 11.7 (73).\n\n4. Determine winners of each game: To determine which team won a particular game, we compare their scores from steps 3. In the first row, Melbourne's score is greater than Richmond's score, indicating that Melbourne won against Richmond. Similarly, in the third row, South Melbourne's score is less than North Melbourne's score, implying that North Melbourne beat South Melbourne.\n\n5.
