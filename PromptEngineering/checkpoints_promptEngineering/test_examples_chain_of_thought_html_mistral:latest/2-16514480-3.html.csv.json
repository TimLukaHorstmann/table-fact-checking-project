Next, we verify whether the given table provides us with enough information to determine the validity of the claim. Yes, the table does provide the necessary information as it includes the place, player, country, score, and to par columns.\n   3. Then, we scan through the rows in the table to find Greg Norman's row based on the player column. We locate his row with index 0 (first row).\n   4. Next, we confirm that the value in the country column for Greg Norman is Australia, which it is.\n   5. Afterward, we verify if the score for Greg Norman includes the term \"-12\". In this case, the score is shown as \"63 + 69 = 132\", and we need to determine if this score, when calculated, equals -12. First, calculate the actual score (132), then subtract par (not provided in table), and check if the result is equal to -12. Unfortunately, without knowing the par value, it's not possible to make a definitive conclusion regarding this part of the claim.\n   6.
