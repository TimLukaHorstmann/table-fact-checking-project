Understand the data structure: The table provides a list of games played by the Golden State Warriors in March 2011. Each row represents a game and contains columns for various statistics such as the opponent, date, and points scored by each player.\n\n3. Extract relevant data: Since we are interested in finding out who led the team in total points for March 2011, we need to go through each game's data and sum up the points scored by Monta Ellis. We will also need to do this for any other player on the team to compare their scores.\n\n4. Sum up the points scored by Monta Ellis: We can see that Monta Ellis scored 27, 37, 0, 18, 34, and 11 points in rows 74, 75, 72, 71, 70, and 73 respectively. Adding these up gives us a total of 129 points.\n\n5.

However, if we assume that there were no other games for the team during March 2011, then Monta Ellis would have led the team in total points.\n\n6.

The column names indicate the date, opponent, points scored by the Warriors, points conceded, and points differential.\n\n2. Find the row that corresponds to the win-loss record after 17 games. In this table format, the first row is the header or label row, so we start counting from the second row (row index = 1).\n\n3. The relevant cells for determining the win-loss record are:\n   - \"Wins\" (column name: \"Points_Differential\"): the number of games where the points differential was positive.\n   - \"Losses\" (column name: \"Points_Differential\"): the number of games where the points differential was negative or zero.\n\n4. Calculate the win-loss record by counting the number of times the points differential is positive (wins) and the number of times it is negative or zero (losses). From the table, we see that there are 15 losses (negative or zero points differential) and 2 wins (positive points differential).\n\n5. The win-loss record of a team after playing 17 games would be recorded as W-L instead of wins-losses in this table format.
