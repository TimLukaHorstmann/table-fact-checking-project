Analyze each row:\n   - Row 1, Bob Stinson from Miami-Dade College, signed but not for 1967.\n   - Row 2, Richard Schryer from the University of Michigan, signed but not for 1967.\n   - Row 3, James Carter from Trinity University, signed but not for 1967.\n   - Row 4, John Green from Gulf Coast Community College is unsigned and not related to USC.\n   - Row 5, John Herbst from the University of Southern California does not have a year specified under the 'signed' column but the mention \"no twins - 1967\" suggests he might not have been signed in 1967 either.\n\n5.
