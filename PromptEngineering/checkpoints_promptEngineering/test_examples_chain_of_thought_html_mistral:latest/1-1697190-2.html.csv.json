    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the table. The table shows tournament statistics for a golfer named Casey Martin from 1998 to 2005.\n2. We are asked if \"Casey Martin never win a tournament\". To answer this question, we should look for rows where the 'wins' column is not equal to 1 (since 1 means there was a win).\n3. From the table, all rows have a 'wins' value of 0 except for the year 2004 and 2005, where it says 't - 69' and 't - 65' respectively under the 'best finish' column. These values suggest that Casey Martin had a top finish in those years but did not actually win the tournament.\n4. Since all other rows have a 'wins' value of 0, it can be concluded that Casey Martin never won a tournament based on the provided data.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand table structure and question\", \"Look for rows where 'wins' column is not equal to 1\", \"Determine if there are any exceptions to this rule in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0}, {\"row_index\": 1}, {\"row_index\": 2}, {\"row_index\": 3}, {\"row_index\": 4}, {\"row_index\": 5}, {\"row_index\": 6}]\n}\n```",
