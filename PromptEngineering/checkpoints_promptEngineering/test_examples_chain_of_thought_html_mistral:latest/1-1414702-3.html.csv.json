Identify the location of each school (Henry Foss is located in central tacoma, Lincoln and Mount Tahoma are located in east tacoma). Since the claim specifies a school located in east tacoma, it's necessary to find out if there's a school with a lower enrollment value that is also in east tacoma.\n5. Evaluate the location of each school that has a 3a classification.
