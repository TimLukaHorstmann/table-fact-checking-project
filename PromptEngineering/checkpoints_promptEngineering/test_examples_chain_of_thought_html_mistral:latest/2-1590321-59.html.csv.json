Verify if there's a row in the table that matches the given name (Titus Ozon).\n   - In this table, the players are listed in rows, so we will search each row for the name \"Titus Ozon\".\n\n3. Check if the years of activity match the claim (1947-1964).\n   - If a matching row is found in step 2, check the \"years\" column of that row to see if it matches the given range (1947-1964).\n\n4. Check if the number of goals scored matches the claim (157 goals).\n   - If both the player's name and years of activity match, check the \"goals\" column in the matching row to see if it equals the given goal count (157).\n\n5. Output the final answer based on the results of steps 2-4.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim components (player name, years active, and goals scored)\", \"Search for a row with the player's name\", \"Check if the years in the matching row match the given range\", \"Compare the number of goals in the matching row to the given goal count\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the years given in the question (1950 through 1965). These years do not appear in the table because all players started playing after 1950.\n\n2. Check if there is any player in the table whose total goals scored during the years 1950 to 1965 can be calculated and found to be less than 160. However, as mentioned in step 1, none of the players started playing before 1950.\n\nSince no player started playing before 1950, it is not possible to calculate the goal score during the years 1950 through 1965 and compare it with 160. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer whether the claim is true or false using this data.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the given years (1950 - 1965), check if any player started playing before these years to calculate their goal score during these years, and compare it with 160.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
