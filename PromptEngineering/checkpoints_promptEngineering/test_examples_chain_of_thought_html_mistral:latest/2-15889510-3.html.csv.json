Next, look for Jamie Whincup's row in the table to find his grid position. We can do this by searching for his name (or team name) in the 'Driver' column and finding the corresponding row index. In this case, Jamie Whincup is in row 1 (based on the top of the table).\n\n3. Once we have found Jamie Whincup's row, we can then find his grid position by looking at the value in the 'Grid Position' column for that same row. In this case, the value in the 'Grid Position' column for row 1 is '1'.\n\n4. Lastly, compare the obtained grid position with the claim. The claim states \"Jamie Whincup's highest grid be 1\".

In this case, it appears that no such column exists (this might imply an error in the table provided). However, we can assume that lower numbers represent fewer laps since the race progresses from start to finish.\n3. Compare the row entries for each team and look for Jim Beam Racing's entry.\n4. Look at the cells for each row of the team entries. In this case, there are two cars from Jim Beam Racing: car #1 with 55 laps and car #2 with a different number of laps (which is irrelevant as we are only concerned about car #1).\n5. Since car #1 from Jim Beam Racing has 55 laps, it implies that the team had at least 55 laps.\n6. The question asks if Jim Beam Racing is the team with 55 laps. We have found a car from Jim Beam Racing (car #1) that has 55 laps, so the claim is true for this specific car.
