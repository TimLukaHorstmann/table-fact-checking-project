Unfortunately, the table does not provide any player names.

Examining the table, we find that in the row with the year 2010, the team is Iowa and the completions are 5. Since the number of completions is not equal to 8, it means that James Vanderberg did not make 8 completions for Iowa when his yard was 45 (because no such year exists in the table).\n\nNow, let's present our answer as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify years for which James Vanderberg played for Iowa\",\n    \"Step 2: Check if there is any row where 'team' equals 'iowa' and 'completions' equals 8\",\n    \"Step 3: Examine the table to see if such a row exists\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"completions\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
