First, identify the key information needed to verify the claim: we need to check if there exists a row where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals and the competition was an international friendly. Since the table does not provide player names, it is impossible to determine whether Rafael M\u00e1rquez played in these matches without additional context. However, we can still check if a team scored exactly 3 goals in an international friendly match.\n\n2. Next, for each row in the table:\n   - Check the competition column to see if it is an international friendly (friendly matches are not specified explicitly but are presumably any matches that do not correspond to specific tournaments).\n   - If the competition is an international friendly, check the score column to determine if there were exactly 3 goals scored by either team.\n\n3. Perform the above checks for each row and see if they match the conditions in the claim.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key information needed to verify the claim.\",\n    \"Check each row for international friendly matches and scores.\",\n    \"Perform checks for all rows.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n\nSince there is no row in the table that meets both conditions (an international friendly match with exactly 3 goals scored), I conclude that the claim is FALSE.",

Check if the \"score\" column in the matching rows shows a goal scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez: In the row with index 8, the competition is \"FIFA World Cup 2006\" and the score shows that team's score was 1 (presumably by M\u00e1rquez) but the opponent's score was higher, indicating a loss. Since a goal in a loss does not count as scoring at a FIFA World Cup, this row is not relevant.\nIn the row with index 11, the competition is \"FIFA World Cup 2010\" and the score shows that both teams scored one goal each (1-1), so it's possible M\u00e1rquez scored in this match but the table does not specify who scored specifically.
