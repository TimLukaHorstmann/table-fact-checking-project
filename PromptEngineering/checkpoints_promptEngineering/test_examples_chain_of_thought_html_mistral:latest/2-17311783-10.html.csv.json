This row has a game number of 76.\n\n2. Next, check if the team in this row is indeed Charlotte. The team in this row is listed as \"charlotte\", which matches our expectation.\n\n3. Then, verify that the score listed for this game shows a win for Charlotte. In this row, the score is given as \"w 97 - 92 (ot)\", indicating a win for Charlotte.\n\n4. Lastly, check if the updated record for Charlotte, based on this win, matches the claim of \"40 - 36\". To do this, we need to find their current record and then add one win. In this table, their record before the game was 39-36 (in the \"record\" column of row 76). Adding a win would result in a new record of 40-36, which matches the claim.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row where Charlotte won\",\n    \"Verify that the team listed is indeed Charlotte\",\n    \"Check if the score shows a win for Charlotte\",\n    \"Ensure that the updated record based on this win matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

On April 12 against New York, he scored 55 points (row 80), which is higher than his score on April 10.\n\n2. Next, check the scores for the games where Michael Beasley had a higher score (i.e., row 80 against New York). The score for this game is given as \"w 122 - 105 (ot)\".\n\n3. Compare this score with the score mentioned in the claim (\"w 97 - 92 (ot)\" for a different game).
