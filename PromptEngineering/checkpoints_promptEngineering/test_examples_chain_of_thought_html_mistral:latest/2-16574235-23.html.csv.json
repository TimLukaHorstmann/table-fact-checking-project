Understand the claim structure: The claim states that two players (boyan yordanov and krasimir gaydarski) were teammates on the same club in a specific year (2008).\n\n3. Identify the relevant columns: Since we're looking for information about the clubs, we need to focus on the \"name\" and \"2008 club\" columns.\n\n4. Check the rows: Compare each player's row with the given names (boyan yordanov and krasimir gaydarski) in the \"name\" column. If both players have the same \"2008 club\", then they were teammates during that year.\n\n5. Analyze the results: Compare the clubs where boyan yordanov and krasimir gaydarski are listed. If their clubs match, they were teammates in 2008; if not, they weren't teammates in 2008.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the claim structure\",\n    \"Identify the relevant columns\",\n    \"Check the rows for each player\",\n    \"Analyze the results\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Examine the table for rows that contain \"vladimir nikolov\" and \"olympiacos\".\n3. Observe if there are any instances where both conditions (name and club) match.\n4. If there is a matching row, confirm whether the name is indeed \"vladimir nikolov\" and the club is \"olympiacos\".\n5. Verify that the year is not explicitly mentioned in the table but since the data is from 2008, if the conditions match, we can assume it refers to the year 2008.\n6.
