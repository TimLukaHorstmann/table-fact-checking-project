    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify all the awards won by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 from the table.\n2. Check if these awards were based on a nomination for a specific show.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n- From the table, we can see that Kristofer Martin received an award in 2012 (Famas Awards) without being nominated for any specific show (as there is no \"nominated for\" value in that row). However, it's not specified what this award was for, so it remains unclear if it was based on a nomination for a specific show.\n- In 2012, he was also nominated for The Young Critics Circle Awards and the 28th pmpc star awards for movies (both with \"nominated\" as the result). Since we don't know the details of these awards, it's unclear if they were based on a nomination for a specific show.\n- In 2012, he won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at the Famas Awards without being nominated for any specific show (as there is no \"nominated for\" value in that row). However, it's not specified what this award was for, so it remains unclear if it was based on a nomination for a specific show.\n- In 2012, he won the most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching at the 1st party pilipinas most liked awards without being nominated for any specific show (as there is no \"nominated for\" value in that row). However, it's not specified what this award was for, so it remains unclear if it was based on a nomination for a specific show.\n- In 2013, he was nominated at the 1st sunday all stars awards but didn't win (as the result is \"nominated\"). There's no specific mention of a show in this award category.\n- In 2013, he won an Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor and won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo and the 10th Golden Screen Awards respectively. Both of these awards have \"oros\" as the nominated for value, so they are based on a specific show (assuming that \"oros\" refers to a specific film or TV show).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all awards won by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013\",\n    \"Check if these awards were based on a nomination for a specific show\",\n    \"In 2012, he won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at the Famas Awards, but no specific mention of a show is given\",\n    \"In 2012, he was nominated for The Young Critics Circle Awards and the 28th pmpc star awards for movies, but no specific mention of a show is given\",\n    \"In 2012, he won the most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching at the 1st party pilipinas most liked awards, but no specific mention of a show is given\",\n    \"In 2013, he was nominated at the 1st sunday all stars awards, but there's no specific mention of a show in this award category\",\n    \"In 2013, he won an Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor and won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo and the 10th Golden Screen Awards respectively.
