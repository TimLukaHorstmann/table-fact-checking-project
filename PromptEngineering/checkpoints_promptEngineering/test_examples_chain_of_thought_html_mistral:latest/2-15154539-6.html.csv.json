    "resp": "1. Identify the games to compare: The claim asks for the game between Barnsley and Bristol Rovers, so we need to find their match from the table.\n\n2. Find the row of the match: We look for a tie no that doesn't have a specific number (indicating a regular game instead of a replay) with home team as \"barnsley\" and away team as \"bristol rovers\". The first match that fits these criteria is in row 4.\n\n3. Extract the score: In this row, we find the score for the match. The column named \"score\" contains the information \"4 - 1\", which represents Barnsley's goal difference in their favor (4 goals scored - 1 goal conceded).\n\n4. Repeat for other games: To compare with other matches, we need to find the goal differences of all other games. We can do this by repeating steps 2 and 3 for each game in the table. However, since the claim asks about the highest point differential, it's unnecessary to calculate every single game's goal difference.\n\n5. Compare the goal differences: To determine if the barnsley-bristol rovers game has the highest goal difference, we only need to find another match with a greater positive value for the goal difference. In this table, none of the other matches have a higher positive goal difference than Barnsley's 3 goals (4 - 1).\n\n6.

Conclusion: The scores for both teams in tie no 5 are identical, meaning the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify row number for tie no 5\", \"Check column names and values for scores\", \"Compare score values for both teams\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
