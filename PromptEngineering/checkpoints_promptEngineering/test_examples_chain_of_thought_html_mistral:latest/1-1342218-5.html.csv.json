The row where the 'incumbent' column contains \"wilbur mills\" corresponds to Arkansas 2 (as identified by the 'district' column).\n\n2. Check the result of the election in this district.

Identify the claim: The claim states that Wilbur Mills was the only democratic candidate to run opposite for the district Arkansas 2, meaning he was unopposed by any other democrats in that district.\n\n2. Review the table to check if Wilbur Mills is indeed a democratic candidate: The table clearly shows that Wilbur Mills is a democratic candidate (third column) for the district Arkansas 2 (first column).\n\n3. Check if Wilbur Mills was opposed by any other democrats in his district: In the table, under the candidates column, it is stated that Wilbur Mills (d) was unopposed. This means he had no opposition within his own party.\n\n4. Determine if there were any other democratic candidates for Arkansas 2: Reviewing the entire table, we can see that only one candidate per district is listed, and all are democrats without any opposition. There is no evidence to suggest that there was another democratic candidate for Arkansas 2.\n\n5. Compare the findings with the claim: The claim stated that Wilbur Mills, the only democratic candidate to run opposite, be the candidate for the district Arkansas 2.
