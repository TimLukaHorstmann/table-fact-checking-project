Calculate the total number of games between pontyclun and barry by assuming they have played once, as there are no multiple entries for either team against each other in the table. The total number of games would be 1 (once) since we assume only one match.\n6. To find the average number of drawn games between these clubs, divide the total number of drawn games (2 for barry) by the number of matches (1 assumed). The result is an average of 2 drawn games.\n7.
