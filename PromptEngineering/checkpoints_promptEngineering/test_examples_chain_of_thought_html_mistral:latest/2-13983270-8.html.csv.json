To verify the claim, we need to find the row in the table where the \"row_index\" corresponds to August 24.\n4. In the table, the row with \"row_index\" 36 corresponds to August 24 (the date can be inferred from the day of the month and the month).\n5. In this row, the value at cell (Wins, Total) is 79 and the value at cell (Losses, Total) is 52.\n6. Since the claim states that the record on August 24 was 79-50, it means we are comparing Wins and Losses.\n7.

To determine if the record on August 24 was 70-50, we need to find the game results for August 24 and compare them with a hypothetical 70-50 record.\n3. In the table, we can see that the game on August 24 is between the Angels (the team in question) and the Athletics. The result of that game is \"5 - 3\" which means the Angels won the game.\n4. To have a record of 70-50 by August 24, the Angels would need to have won 70 games and lost 50 games before that date. Since we see that they had 79 wins (83 - 4) and 51 losses by August 28, and on August 24 they added another win, their current record is 80-51 which is not equal to 70-50.\n\nanswer: \"FALSE\"\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}, {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"Wins\"}, {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"}]",
