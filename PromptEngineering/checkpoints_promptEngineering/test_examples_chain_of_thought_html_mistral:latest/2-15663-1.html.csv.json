    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Check the given table to find the row where the live birth count (43243) matches with any other value. This will help us find the corresponding migration value for the live birth count of 43243.\n2. In the table, the live birth count of 43243 is present in the 8th row.\n3. To find the migration value, we look for the column named \"Migration\" (column index 6) in the same row (row_index 8).\n4. In the 8th row and 6th column, the value for migration is -13470.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row where the live birth count (43243) matches\",\n    \"Identify the corresponding migration value for the live birth count of 43243\",\n    \"The live birth count is present in the 8th row, find the migration value in the same row and column (6th column named 'Migration')\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"Migration\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
