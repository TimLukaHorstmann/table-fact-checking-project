Compare the data for other cities: We need to compare New York with the other cities in the table regarding their media market rankings and number of teams from four major leagues.\n\n5. Find the max media market ranking among cities with 4+ teams: To find the largest media market, we must identify cities with at least four teams from four major leagues since the claim states that New York has four.

Compare the values in the \"media market ranking\" column to determine the smallest market rank. From the table, we can see that the city of Washington D.C. has a market rank of 9 while Philadelphia's market rank is 4. Since 4 is smaller than 9, Philadelphia does not have the smallest market rank.\n\n3. Check if Philadelphia has a team from at least one of the four major sports (MLB, NBA) to see if it can be among the cities with the longest streak with a team from the four major sports. By examining the \"mlb team (s)\" and \"nba team (s)\" columns, we can find that Philadelphia has both MLB (Phillies) and NBA (76ers) teams.\n\n4.
