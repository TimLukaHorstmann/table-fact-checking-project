    "resp": "Here is my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I need to identify the game whose date is November 4th. In the table, each row corresponds to a game and the \"date\" column provides the date of the game. Therefore, I will look for the row where the \"date\" value is \"november 4\".\n\n2. Next, I need to check whether the result of this specific game matches with the claim. In the table, the \"result\" column provides the outcome of each game. Therefore, I will compare the result provided in the row corresponding to November 4th with the claim (\"w 10 - 3\").\n\n3.
