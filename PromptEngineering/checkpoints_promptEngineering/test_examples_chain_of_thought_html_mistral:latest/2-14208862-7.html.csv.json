    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify the column names from the table's header to understand the structure of the data. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record.\n2. Scroll through the rows (data) of the table to find the row where the \"date\" matches with March 8.\n3. Check the \"home\" column for this particular row to see who the home team was for the game on March 8.\n4. Compare the value found in step 3 with the claim's statement about the home team being Minnesota.\n5. If the values match, then the claim is true; if not, the claim is false.\n\nNow let's output the JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table structure by examining its column headers\",\n    \"Find the row with the 'date' matching March 8\",\n    \"Check the 'home' column for that specific row\",\n    \"Compare the value found in step 3 with the claim's statement about the home team being Minnesota\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Edmonton was a visitor on March 9 to Philadelphia, with a record of 44 - 7 - 15.\n2. Find the row for the date 'march 9': In the table, we can see that there is only one row where the 'Date' column value matches 'march 9'.\n3. Check the team names in the row: The row containing the 'march 9' date has the 'Team A' value as Edmonton and 'Team B' value as Philadelphia. This confirms that Edmonton was a visitor on March 9 to Philadelphia.\n4. Check the team records: To find out if the record of Edmonton (which visited Philadelphia on March 9) matches 44 - 7 - 15, we need to find another row where the 'Team A' value is also Edmonton and look at its 'Record' column. In this table, there is no such row that meets these criteria.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the row for the date 'march 9'\", \"Check the team names in the row\", \"Check the team records\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Team A\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Record\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Quebec has a decision of \"myre\" and a record of \"44 - 7 - 15\".\n2. Locate the team name in the table: To find out if Quebec appears in the table, we search for rows where the 'home' column contains \"quebec\".\n3. Identify the decision (goalkeeper) for Quebec: The goalkeepers are indicated by their names in the \"home\" column. So, we look for rows where the 'home' column contains \"quebec\" and the 'decision' (indirectly represented by the 'home' column) is a goalkeeper name.\n4. Verify the record for Quebec: If we find a row where the 'home' column contains \"quebec\" and the decision is a goalkeeper, we then verify that the record (in the row where the 'home' equals \"quebec\") matches \"44 - 7 - 15\".\n\nHere's the relevant JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and its components\",\n    \"Locate the team name in the table (home column)\",\n    \"Identify the decision (goalkeeper) for Quebec\",\n    \"Verify the record for Quebec\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
