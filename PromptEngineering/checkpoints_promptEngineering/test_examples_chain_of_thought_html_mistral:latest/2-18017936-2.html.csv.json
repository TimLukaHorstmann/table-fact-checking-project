Find the position of each club by looking at the table headers (the numbers represent positions). The position is determined by where the club name appears in the table (lower positions mean higher ranks).\n3. Check if the win count for each club matches their corresponding position. In other words, check if the number of wins indicated by the club's row under the \"W\" column (which represents wins) corresponds to their position.\n\nAfter analyzing the table, the reasoning steps are:\n- FK Valmiera is located in the 9th row and has 13 wins (under the 'W' column). Looking at the table, we can see that only 2 clubs have higher positions (positions 1-8), so their position should be 9. However, since there are other clubs with equal win counts but lower positions, FK Valmiera may not necessarily have a position of 9.\n- Liepaja Metalurgs - 2 is located in the 8th row and also has 13 wins (under the 'W' column). As mentioned earlier, their position should be 8.\n\nGiven that both clubs have the same win count and are listed with that win count at positions 7 and 8 respectively, the answer is neither TRUE nor FALSE; it's more of a partial match. However, since we cannot consider a \"partial\" result in this context, let's focus on FK Valmiera to keep the answer simple:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify clubs of interest: FK Valmiera and Liepaja Metalurgs - 2\",\n    \"Find their positions by looking at table headers\",\n    \"Check if number of wins corresponds to their position in the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"W\" }, // FK Valmiera's win count\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"W\" } // Liepaja Metalurgs - 2's win count\n  ]\n}",
