In the table, players who share the same row number are tied (e.g., Darren Clarke is in row 1 alone, Justin Leonard and Jesper Parnevik are in row 2, and Fred Couples and David Tapping are in row 4). So, if their scores and to par columns match, they are indeed tied for a place.\n\n4. I find the rows corresponding to Fred Couples (row 4) and David Tapping (row 4). Their respective scores in the score column are both 137, which indicates that they share the same score.\n\n5. In the \"to par\" column for both players, their values are also the same (-5), indicating that they have the same number of strokes under par.
