    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the relevant data for Tisha Venturini's matches: The table provides us with various details about each match, but we need to focus on finding the matches where Tisha played and whether those matches ended in a draw. Since the table doesn't list individual players, I will look for patterns that might suggest Tisha's involvement in these matches.\n\n2. Narrow down the matches: The table contains two sets of identical rows labeled with tournament names (1995 fifa women 's world cup final, atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament, and usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup), which are likely repetitions. We can safely ignore these repetitions and only consider the matches that occurred on specific dates (1995-06-06, 1996-07-25, and 1999-07-10).\n\n3. Check for Tisha's involvement: Since we don't have information about individual players in the table, we cannot definitively determine Tisha's involvement in these matches based solely on the provided data. However, since the claim specifies that these are matches from Tisha Venturini's career, we can assume that she must have played in at least one of these matches.\n\n4. Check for draws: Among the three dates specified in the claim (1995-06-06, 1996-07-25, and 1999-07-10), only the match on 1996-07-25 is listed as a draw (2 - 1). The matches on 1995-06-06 and 1999-07-10 are not explicitly labeled as draws, but the scores suggest that they were not drawn.\n\nSince we cannot definitively determine Tisha's involvement in the matches (step 3), but we can confirm that one of the matches specified in the claim ended in a draw (step 4), I will provide an answer with some qualifications:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant data for Tisha Venturini's matches\",\n    \"Narrow down the matches to those occurring on specific dates listed in the claim\",\n    \"Assume that Tisha must have played in at least one of these matches due to the claim being about her career\",\n    \"Check for draws among the matches specified in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"We cannot definitively determine if all three matches occurred during Tisha's career, but one of them (1996-07-25) ended in a draw.\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Result\" }\n  ]\n}",

Count the number of matches played by Tisha Venturini in each tournament: To do this, we can compare her name with the 'lineup' column to see if there is any match. Since no specific player names are mentioned in the table, it's impossible to confirm that she was part of a particular lineup without additional information.\n3. Determine the total number of matches played by Tisha Venturini: If we assume that all the matches listed in the table are the ones Tisha played (as there is no other way to verify this), then we can count the rows and find the total number of matches she played.\n4. Compare the total number of matches with the total number of matches across different tournaments: If the total number of matches is equal to or greater than the sum of the matches in each tournament, it means that Tisha has played more than 13 matches in at least one tournament. However, since we only found three distinct tournaments and the number of matches seems to add up (without knowing if Tisha participated in those matches), it is likely that she played fewer than 13 matches in each tournament.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of unique tournaments\",\n    \"Identify the total number of matches played by Tisha Venturini in each tournament\",\n    \"Determine the total number of matches played by Tisha Venturini\",\n    \"Compare the total number of matches with the total number of matches across different tournaments\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

However, since every match in the table has unique teams involved, and all matches on the specified date (1995-06-10) are either before or after the given time, it is reasonable to assume that \"start\" refers to one of those matches (since no other match on any other day has a \"start\" designation).\n   - Result: Check if the result (score) matches with any score in the table for the corresponding date and location. In this case, the claim's result is \"4 - 1\", which corresponds to the score of the match at row 3.\n   - Competition/Group stage: The claim mentions \"group match\" but there isn't a specific competition mentioned in the table. However, since every match on the specified date (1995-06-10) is part of some group stage for various competitions, and it was impossible to pinpoint a single competition with only the given information, we can still consider that the claim's \"group match\" might be referring to any group stage match on that date.\n\n3.
