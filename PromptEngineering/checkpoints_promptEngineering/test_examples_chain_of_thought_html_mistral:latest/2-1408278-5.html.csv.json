    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the player for whom we need to find the most common opponent: The claim mentions Yevgeny Kafelnikov, so that's our focus.\n2. Count the number of times Kafelnikov faced each opponent in a final: We will look for rows where Kafelnikov is listed as either 'winner' or 'runner-up' and check the column 'opponent in the final'. For simplicity, let's assign 1 point for each match against an opponent.\n3. Find pairs of opponents with the same count: If two opponents have the same count (2 points in this case), that means Kafelnikov faced them both twice.\n4. Compare the results: If there is a pair of opponents with a count of 2, the claim will be true; if not, it will be false.\n\nNow let's check the table and see if we find any opponent who has played against Kafelnikov in 2 matches.\n\nFrom the table, I found that Yevgeny Kafelnikov played against himself twice (in different rows) at the Stockholm tournament on 2 August 1999 and 20 November 2000. Additionally, he faced Martin Damm and Yevgeny Kafelnikov again in the final at Copenhagen on 10 October 1998 and St. Petersburg on 24 October 2005, respectively.\n\nSince there are two pairs of opponents (Martin Damm and Yevgeny Kafelnikov) who have a count of 2 matches against Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the player mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Count the number of times the selected player faced each opponent\",\n    \"Find pairs of opponents with the same count\",\n    \"Compare the results to determine if there is a match for the most common opponent\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\" }\n  ]\n}",
