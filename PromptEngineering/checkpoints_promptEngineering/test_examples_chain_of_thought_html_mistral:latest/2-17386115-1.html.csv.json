Determine the relevant columns: We need to find out the player's name (to verify if it's Ken Irvin) and the round number they were picked in. In our table, these are represented by the 'player' column and the 'round' column respectively.\n3. Verify the player's name: Scan through the table to locate the row where the player's name matches 'ken irvin'. We find this in the 5th row of the 'player' column.\n4. Check the round number: Next, check the 'round' column for the same row. In this case, the value is '4', which means Ken Irvin was indeed picked in the fourth round.\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the round where Ken Irvin was picked. That can be done by looking for a player named \"ken irvin\" in the table and checking the value of the \"round\" column for that row.\n\n2. The relevant cell for this step is the one with the row_index=5 and column_name=\"round\". In our table, the round for Ken Irvin is 4 (since the 5th row represents the 4th pick).\n\n3. Now we need to compare the round in which Ken Irvin was drafted with the round mentioned in the claim. The claim states that Ken Irvin was drafted in the 1st round.\n\n4. Comparing the actual round (4) with the claimed round (1), we find a discrepancy between them.\n\n5. Since the claimed round is not equal to the actual round, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"round\"\n  }\n]\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Find the round in which Ken Irvin was drafted\",\n    \"Step 2: Compare the claimed round with the actual round\",\n    \"Step 3: Check if they are equal\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This implies we need to find a player whose school/club team is 'michigan' and whose pick (round selection) is within the 4th round (between 101 and 125, as picks start at 1).\n2. Scan through the table column-wise: Since the relevant information about the players (their school/club team and their pick) is in the last two columns, we can scan through these columns first to find a player from Michigan.\n3. Row-wise verification: Once we have found a player from Michigan, verify that the row number corresponds to a pick between 101 and 125 (inclusive).\n4.
