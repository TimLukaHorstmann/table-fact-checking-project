    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify all the versions labeled as \"live version (recorded in ...)\" in the table. This will help us find the live versions that we need to compare.\n\n2. From step 1, select the two live versions with the earliest years (1989 and 1996). These are the versions we will be comparing for length.\n\n3. Look up the row in the table where the year is 1989 and find the version's length by reading its value from the \"length\" column. This will give us the length of the live version recorded in 1989.\n\n4. Similarly, look up the row in the table where the year is 1996 and find the version's length by reading its value from the \"length\" column. This will give us the length of the live version recorded in 1996.\n\n5. Compare the lengths obtained in steps 3 and 4. If the length of the live version recorded in 1989 is greater than or equal to the length of the live version recorded in 1996, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's output the final answer using the JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify all live versions in the table\", \"Select the live versions from 1989 and 1996\", \"Find the lengths of the selected live versions\", \"Compare the obtained lengths\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"length\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"length\"}\n  ]\n}",
