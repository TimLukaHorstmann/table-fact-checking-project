We will look for rows where Ty Lawson's assist count is either the maximum value (indicating he led) or equal to the maximum value (indicating a tie).\n4. Count the number of matches: Count the number of instances where Ty Lawson has the highest number of assists (leading position) or ties with someone else for the most assists in a game.\n5. Compare the count with the claim: If the count is equal to or greater than 10, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: Ty Lawson led or was tied for the lead in assists for 10 out of 13 games\",\n    \"Determine how to verify the claim: Count the number of games where Ty Lawson either had the highest number of assists or tied for the first place with someone else\",\n    \"Find the relevant data: Use the provided table to find the number of assists for each player in every game\",\n    \"Count the number of matches: Count the number of instances where Ty Lawson has the highest number of assists (leading position) or ties with someone else for the most assists in a game\",\n    \"Compare the count with the claim: If the count is equal to or greater than 10, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Assists\" }\n  ]\n}",
