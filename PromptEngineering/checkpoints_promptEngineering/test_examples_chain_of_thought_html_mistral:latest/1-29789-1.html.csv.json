Locate the row containing Russia by matching its country name with the \"country\" column of the table. In the given table, the row index is 9.\n3. Check the \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" column for the identified row to find the number of international tourists who visited Russia in 2012.

    "resp": "1. Identify the UNWTO region mentioned in the claim: The claim states the tourist arrivals are from the Asia region.\n2. Locate the rows in the table that correspond to countries in the Asia region: In the given table, only one country (China) belongs to the Asia region.\n3. Extract the relevant data for the year 2012 and compare it with the data for 2011: For China in 2012, the international tourist arrivals are 57.7 million. There is no column for tourist arrivals data for 2011. However, we can calculate the previous year's (2011) arrivals based on the percentage change from 2010 to 2011 and then from 2011 to 2012:\n   a. Find the percentage change from 2010 to 2011 for China: The table shows +3.4% as the change from 2010 to 2011 for China.\n   b. Calculate the estimated number of international tourist arrivals for 2011 based on the percentage change: To do this, we need to know the exact number of tourists in 2010 (which is not provided). However, given that the percentage increase was 3.4%, we can estimate an approximate value by multiplying the 2012 count by (1 + percentage change):\n      57.7 million * (1 + 0.034) = 59.3668 million (approx.)\n4. Compare the calculated tourist arrivals for 2011 with the actual data in 2012: The estimated number of international tourist arrivals for 2011 is approximately 59.37 million. However, the actual data provided for 2011 is not available in the table.\n5. Since we cannot directly compare the calculated 2011 value with the 2012 data due to missing information, we cannot definitively answer the claim based on the given table.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the UNWTO region mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Locate the rows that correspond to countries in the Asia region\",\n    \"Extract relevant data for the year 2012 and compare it with the data for 2011\",\n    \"Find the percentage change from 2010 to 2011 for China\",\n    \"Calculate the estimated number of international tourist arrivals for 2011 based on the percentage change\",\n    \"Compare the calculated tourist arrivals for 2011 with the actual data in 2012\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"UNABLE TO DETERMINE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"change (2010 to 2011)\" }\n  ]\n}",
