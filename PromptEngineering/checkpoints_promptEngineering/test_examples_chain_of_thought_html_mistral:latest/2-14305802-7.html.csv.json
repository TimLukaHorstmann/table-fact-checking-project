    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the column in the table that corresponds to the date (March). The March dates are represented by the 'march' column.\n2. Determine the row index for the game where the March date is 28, since the March date is given and we need to find the corresponding opponent. By counting rows, we can see that the row with March date 28 corresponds to the row with the index 73.\n3. Inspect the 'opponent' column of the row with index 73, as that is the row where the March date is 28. The value in the 'opponent' column for this row is \"colorado rockies\".\n4. Conclude that the opponent that played on March 28 was indeed the Colorado Rockies.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the 'march' column, find the row with March date 28 (row index = 73), inspect the 'opponent' column of that row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to find the row where 'march' column value is 4 or 5 as these represent dates closest to March 24 (since March has 31 days). The reason for choosing these rows is that we are looking for an opponent who played on March 24 and the game dates in the table are sequential.\n\n2. In the given table, row index 4 and 5 have 'march' column value as 4 and 5 respectively.\n\n3. Next, we check the opponent column values for these rows to see if they match with the given claim \"the opponent that be present on march 24 be the colorado rockies\".\n\n4. In row 4, the opponent is Atlanta flames which does not match the given claim. However, in row 5, the opponent is Colorado Rockies. This matches the given claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the rows where 'march' column value is 4 or 5.\",\n    \"Check the opponent column values for these rows.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
