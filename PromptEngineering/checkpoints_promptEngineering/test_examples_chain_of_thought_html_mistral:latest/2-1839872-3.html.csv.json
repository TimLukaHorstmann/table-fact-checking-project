In this case, the employed dates for \"clive thomas woosnam\" are from 1970 to 2005.\n3.

Then, go through each row of the table and check if the name in the first column matches with the given name from step 1. If it does, that row contains the required information.\n\n3. Since the claim is about employment years, we need to focus on the second column which provides the employment details.\n\n4. In the found row, check if the employment years mentioned in the second column of the table (1970 - 2005) match with the years given in the claim (1970 - 1996).\n\n5.
