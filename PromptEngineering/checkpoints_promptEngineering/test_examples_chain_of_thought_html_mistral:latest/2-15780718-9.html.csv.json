Locate the rows in the table where the opponent team is Miami (row_index 78, 77, 76 as these games were against Miami).\n3. Check the \"high rebounds\" column for each of the identified rows to find the rebound values for Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy when they played against Miami:\n   - Row 77: Alvin Williams (16)\n   - Row 78: Jerome Williams (15)\n4. Compare the rebound values for each player in the games where they played against Miami:\n   - Michael Bradley did not play in the game against Miami in row 77.\n   - In the game against Miami in row 78, Jelani McCoy had 15 rebounds while Michael Bradley did not play.\n5.
