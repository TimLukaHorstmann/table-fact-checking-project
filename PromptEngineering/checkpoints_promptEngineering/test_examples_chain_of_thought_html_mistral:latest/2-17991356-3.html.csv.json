Compare the given years with the found years: Since the claim mentions 1996 and 1991, we compare the found years with these years. Davis Love III did not win in 1996 because his win was in 1997 according to the table. As for 1991, he indeed won that year as per the table.\n\n5.

The claim states that only 5 of the 7 players in the 2003 PGA championship were from the United States.\n2. Next, identify whether the table provides any information about the year of the PGA Championship for these players. It does not. So, we cannot verify the claim directly from this table.\n3. However, the table provides a list of players who won the PGA Championship in different years and their countries. Since all of them are from the United States, it might seem like there is no way to prove or disprove the claim without knowing the year 2003 data. But, let's consider the claim more closely: the claim states that \"only\" 5 of the 7 players were from the United States in the 2003 PGA Championship. The table does not provide data for every player each year, so it is possible that there are more than 7 American golfers who have won the PGA Championship. If this were the case, then the claim would be incorrect even if all 7 players in the table were from the United States and none from the 2003 championship were included.\n4.
