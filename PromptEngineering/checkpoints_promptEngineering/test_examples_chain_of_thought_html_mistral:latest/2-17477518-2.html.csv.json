However, since it is spelled \"ian\" here, we will proceed by looking for 'ian hutchinson'.\n2. Next, look for the column named 'rider' and iterate through each row to find the rider's name in the table.\n3. If a match is found, then check the team name in the same row by finding the column named 'team'. Verify if it matches with Yamaha.\n4. If both the rider's name and team name match, then proceed to check the speed. Find the column named 'speed' and find the value associated with the matched row.\n5. Check if the speed value is equal to 120.953 mph (we are case-insensitive in this context).\n6. If all checks pass, return a JSON object with a \"TRUE\" answer and relevant cells.

Locate the row in the table that corresponds to Gary Johnson, which can be found by matching his name (Gary Johnson) with the values in the \"rider\" column.
