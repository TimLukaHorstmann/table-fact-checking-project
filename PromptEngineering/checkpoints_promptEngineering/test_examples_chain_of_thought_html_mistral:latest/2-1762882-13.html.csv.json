Identify the time frame for the Scottish football season mentioned in the table - We can see that the dates provided range from August 2003 to May 2004, suggesting this is a time frame within the 2003-04 season.\n\n2. Check for matches where Scotland scored 0 points (i.e., lost or drew) - To score 0 points, a team must either draw or lose a match. We can see that there are three rows with scores of \"0 - 0\", which indicates draws.\n\n3. Count the number of times Scotland scored 0 points - In total, we see three instances where Scotland scored 0 points (i.e., they drew).\n\n4. Compare the counted number to the claimed number - The claim is that Scotland scored 0 points 3 times during the season. After counting the instances in step 3, we find that this matches the claimed number.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the time frame for the Scottish football season\",\n    \"Check for matches where Scotland scored 0 points (i.e., lost or drew)\",\n    \"Count the number of times Scotland scored 0 points\",\n    \"Compare the counted number to the claimed number\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0 },\n    { \"row_index\": 1 },\n    { \"row_index\": 3 },\n    { \"row_index\": 6 }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "1. Identify the timeframe to check in the table: The claim mentions the 2003-04 season, but since there's no specific year mentioned in the table, we have to assume that the data represents matches from this season or a subsequent one (since the table does not show dates before August 2003).\n\n2. Look for the number of occurrences of \"Hampden park, Glasgow\" as the venue: To verify if Scotland played at Hampden park 4 times during that period, we need to count the rows where the venue is specified as \"Hampden park, Glasgow\".\n\n3. Count the matches in Hampden park, Glasgow: From the table, there are 5 rows with \"Hampden park, Glasgow\" as the venue.\n\n4. Compare the counted occurrences with the claim: The number of occurrences (5) is higher than the claimed number (4), so we have a discrepancy between the data and the claim. However, it's possible that one of these matches does not belong to the 2003-04 season as assumed in step 1.\n\n5. Cross-check the competitions: In the table, there are two different competitions mentioned: \"friendly\" and an unspecified competition (ecqg5 or ecqpo). If we assume that \"ecqg5\" and \"ecqpo\" represent the same competition for this season, then the matches from this column can also be checked to confirm which of them are part of the 2003-04 season.\n\n6. Review the specific dates: In the table, the earliest date is August 2003 (20 august), and the latest date does not provide enough context as it only mentions \"may\" without any year.

Identify the venues for Scotland's matches: There are two venues mentioned in the table, 'ullevaal stadium , oslo (a)' and 'hampden park , glasgow (h)'.\n\n2.

Compare the counts: To check the claim, we need to compare the count of matches played at 'hampden park' with the count at 'ullevaal stadium'. Comparing 7 (Hampden Park) and 1 (Ullevaal Stadium), we find that Scotland played 6 more times at Hampden Park than at Ullevaal Stadium.\n\nSince the claim states \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland play at hampden park , glasgow 3 more time than they do ullevaal stadium , oslo\", and our comparison shows that Scotland played exactly 6 more times at Hampden Park, our final answer is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the venues for Scotland's matches\", \"Count the number of times each venue was used\", \"Compare the counts\", \"Check if the count difference matches with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Next, we look for any matches where Scotland (represented by '(h)') is the home team and the venue is Edinburgh. This will give us potential matches where Scotland could have beaten Easter Road.\n4. Since there are no matches with a venue containing 'edinburgh' and Scotland as the home team other than the match at Easter Road on 30 May, we focus on this game.\n5.
