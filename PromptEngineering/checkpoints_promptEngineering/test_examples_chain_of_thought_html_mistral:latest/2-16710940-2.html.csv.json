    "resp": "1. Identify the game we are looking for, which is the one against St Louis Cardinals. In this table, the opponent's name is used to identify each row. The game we are interested in has an opponent named \"St louis cardinals\".\n\n2. Find the attendance for that specific game. In this table, the attendance is in the 5th column (column_name: 'attendance'). We need to find the value in the 5th column of the row where the opponent is \"St louis cardinals\".\n\n3. Compare the found attendance with other games. To check if it has the highest attendance, we need to compare it with the attendances of all other games in the table. We will do this by checking if there exists any game where the attendance is greater than the one found for St Louis Cardinals game.\n\n4. Output the final answer based on the comparison. If there is no game with a higher attendance, then the claim is true, and we should output { \"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": 'attendance'} ] }\n\n5. If during the search for other games, we find one with a higher attendance, then the claim is false, and we should output { \"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": 'attendance'}, {\"row_index\": <index of the row with higher attendance>, \"column_name\": 'attendance'} ] }\n\n6. Perform the search in the table and compare the attendances. Let's find the attendance for St Louis Cardinals game: 42172. Now let's see if there are any games with a higher attendance.
