The table includes data about different rounds, picks, players, their nationalities, and their school/club teams.\n\n2. Find out if there is any information regarding the Boston Celtics or the year 1985 in the table. Since neither of these pieces of information can be found in the provided table, we would initially assume that the claim is FALSE as there's no clear connection between the data in the table and the specified NBA draft by the Boston Celtics in 1985.\n\n3. However, since the table only provides a small sample of data (just seven rows), it may not be comprehensive or representative of all the players that were ever drafted by any team. Thus, we cannot definitively say that no player from La Salle was ever drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1985 without checking more comprehensive data sources.\n\n4. To further verify the claim, external research would be necessary to find out which players were actually drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1985 and whether any of them attended La Salle. If a match is found, then the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, it remains FALSE.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure and data, Find if Boston Celtics or year 1985 are present, Compare the sample data to the claim, Perform external research to verify the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

We do this by scanning the \"pick\" column for a player named Albert Butts. In this case, we see that his pick number is 116 (row index 4).\n\n2. Next, we need to find out the pick number for Cliff Webber. This can be done in the same way as above, by scanning the \"pick\" column for a player named Cliff Webber. In this case, we see that his pick number is 93 (row index 3).\n\n3. Now, we compare the pick numbers of Albert Butts and Cliff Webber to determine if Albert was drafted after Cliff in the given year. Comparing the two numbers (116 > 93), we see that Albert Butts was indeed drafted after Cliff Webber.\n\n4. Finally, we check if the given year is mentioned anywhere in the table. We see that there are no years specified for each player, so it's reasonable to assume that all players listed were from the same year since the table doesn't provide any indication of different years.\n\n   Based on our reasoning, we can conclude that the claim \"albert butt be draft 23 pick after cliff webber in 1985\" is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find Albert Butts' pick number\",\n    \"Find Cliff Webber's pick number\",\n    \"Compare the two pick numbers to determine draft order\",\n    \"Check for any specified year in the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}",

In this case, Andre Battle has a pick number of 70 and Chris Remly has a pick number of 139.\n3. Compare the pick numbers of both players. A lower pick number means an earlier draft pick.
