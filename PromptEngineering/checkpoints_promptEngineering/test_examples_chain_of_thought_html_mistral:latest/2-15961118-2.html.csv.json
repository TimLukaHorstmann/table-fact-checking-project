    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is \"cup noodle - honda\".\n2. Check the machines associated with the \"cup noodle - honda\" team. The machine in 1993 and 1994 is \"nsr250\".\n3. Verify if there's another row in the table where the team is still \"cup noodle - honda\", the machine is either \"nsr250\" or something else, and the points are less than 8 (to ensure we don't count their later years with higher points).\n4. Inspect each row to find a match that fulfills the conditions mentioned above. The relevant rows for our inspection are:\n    - Row_1 (year=1993, points=8)\n    - Row_2 (year=1994, points=11)\n    - Row_5 (year=1997, points=134) // Since the machine is different (\"nsr500v\") and the points are more than 8, we can exclude this row.\n\nSince there's no other row matching our conditions after checking rows 1-2, our conclusion is that \"cup noodle honda\" was the only team with \"nsr250\" and had less than 8 points.\n\nHere's the final JSON answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team to look for.\",\n    \"Check the associated machines of the target team.\",\n    \"Examine each row to find a match where the team has 'nsr250' and less than 8 points, excluding the target year if necessary.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
