The home team's score is listed in the \"home team score\" column and the away team's score is in the \"away team score\" column.\n\n2. Next, we compare the scores for each match to determine if the home team has a higher score than the away team.\n\n3.

Finally, we calculate the number of matches where the home team has a higher score than the away team: there are 3 such matches (geelong, fitzroy, and footscray).
