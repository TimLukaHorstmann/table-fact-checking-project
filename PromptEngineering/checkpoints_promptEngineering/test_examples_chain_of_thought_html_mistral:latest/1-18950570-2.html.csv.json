In this table, years are not explicitly provided, but we can infer them based on the pattern of every third column being the year. So, the relevant rows would be rows 23 (1990), 24 (1991), 25 (1992), 26 (1993), 27 (1994), and 28 (1995).\n\n3.

Find relevant data in the table: To verify the claim, we need to find the number of deaths and live births for each year within the given time frame (1965-1970). The table provides this information under columns \"Death\" and \"Live Birth\".\n\n3. Analyze the data: Examine the rows corresponding to 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1970. For deaths, the values are: 944,200, 957,600, 963,400, 965,000, and 966,600 respectively. For live births, the values are: 2,815,000, 2,910,000, 2,702,000, 2,461,000, 2,538,000, and 2,425,000 respectively.\n\n4. Evaluate the claim: To find the average deaths per year within this period, we calculate the mean of the death values (944,200 + 957,600 + 963,400 + 965,000 + 966,600)/6 = 961,800. The closest yearly death count to the claim (998,000) is 966,600 from 1970, which is not equal to the claimed number (998,000).\n\nHowever, for live births, the average value within this period is (2,815,000 + 2,910,000 + 2,702,000 + 2,461,000 + 2,538,000 + 2,425,000)/6 = 2,692,000.

To find the live births for the years 1975-1980, we will extract the values from these specific rows.\n\n4. Analyze the extracted data: Once we have the relevant data, we can compare it to the claim. In this case, we should see if there is a row where the year matches one of 1975-1980 and the value in the \"Live Births\" column equals 3,624,000.\n\n5. Draw a conclusion: If we find such a row, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Locate relevant data\", \"Extract relevant data\", \"Analyze extracted data\", \"Draw conclusion\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Live Births\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Live Births\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Live Births\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Live Births\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Live Births\"}\n     ]\n   }",
