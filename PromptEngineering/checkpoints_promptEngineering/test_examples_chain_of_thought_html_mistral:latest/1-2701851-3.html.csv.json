    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. First, identify the pattern for production codes. The table shows a numerical sequence (e.g., 201a, 203b, 205c) with an 'a' as the initial letter of the second part. This suggests that the first number corresponds to the episode number within the series and the second part is just a label (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c').\n2. Next, identify the pattern for season numbers. There doesn't appear to be a consistent pattern for season numbers in the table. Some episodes have '1' as their first digit, but not all of them do.\n3. Check if there is an episode with the production code \"14a\". Looking through the table, there is no episode labeled as \"14a\", so we cannot find a matching series or season for it.\n4. The title \"spontaneously combustible\" doesn't match any of the titles listed in the provided table.\n5. Therefore, there is no evidence to support that \"201a\" corresponds to the 14a series and title \"spontaneously combustible\".\n\nanswer: FALSE\nrelevant_cells: []",
