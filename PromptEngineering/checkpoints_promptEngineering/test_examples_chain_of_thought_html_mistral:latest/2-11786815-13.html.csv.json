Find the attendance for each filtered row: For each filtered row, we will look at the 'attendance' column to get the corresponding attendance value.\n\n4. Compare the attendance values: We need to compare the attendance values of both filtered rows to check if any value is greater than 20066.

Check if the attendance value found in step 3 is higher than 20066: In this case, the attendance value for the row where the score equals \"4 - 2\" is 17132.
