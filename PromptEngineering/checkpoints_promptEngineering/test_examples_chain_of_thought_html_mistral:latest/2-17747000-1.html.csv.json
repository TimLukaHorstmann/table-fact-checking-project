Assuming that since the table shows results of soccer matches, and a usual tournament format for soccer has a 16-team knockout stage known as the Round of 16, we will interpret the claim to be referring to this stage.\n\n2. Define what constitutes a \"single point\": In soccer, a draw is considered half a point each for both teams. Since no team can earn more than 1 point in a single match, a team failing to score a single point means they lost or drew the match.\n\n3. Examine all rows of the table: The table contains matches between teams from different divisions (D1, D2, and D3). However, only teams from D1 are participating in the round that resembles a knockout stage based on our previous assumption.\n\n4. Search for any teams who failed to score a single point: Analyze each row where team 1 and team 2 are from division 1 (rows with indexes 0, 1, 3, and 5). We can see that toulouse fc, lille osc, montpellier hsc, stade de reims, and fc metz all have scores greater than or equal to 2-2 (i.e., draws), so they earned at least half a point. The only team left is fc s\u00e8te with a score of 0-1, which means they did not earn any points in the match.\n\n5. Check if there are other teams who failed to score a single point: Examine all remaining rows (rows with indexes 2, 4, 6, and 7) containing teams from division 2. The team so chtellerault drew against us cr\u00e9teil, earning half a point, while aep bourg sous la roche lost against stade quimp\u00e9rois but earned at least half a point with the score of 3-5. There are no other teams in the table that did not earn any points.\n\n6.
