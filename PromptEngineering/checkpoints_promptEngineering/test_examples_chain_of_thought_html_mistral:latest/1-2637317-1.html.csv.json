    "resp": "1. First, we need to determine the change in percentage of the country's population since 1993 for each region. The table provided does not specify the total population at a specific time (e.g., 1993). However, it provides relative changes between regions.\n\n2. Since there is no absolute population data available, we can only determine if the claim's stated percentage change (0.4) matches with the region mentioned in the claim (\"lambayeque\"). If so, the claim would be true, regardless of the actual total population percentage for Lambayeque.\n\n3. To check if the claim is correct, we need to find the row corresponding to \"lambayeque\" in the table and compare its relative change with 0.4.\n\n4. Relevant cells: [{\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"change\"}, {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"% of total population\"}]\n\n5. The relevant cell values are 0.1 for the change and not provided for the percentage of total population as it is a relative value (a percentage in relation to the national average). However, we can see from the table that each row represents a region, so each number in the \"change\" column represents the change in % for the respective region since 1993.\n\n6. Comparing the claim's stated percentage change with the relative change provided for Lambayeque, we find that 0.4 is not equal to 0.1 (the change in % for Lambayeque).
