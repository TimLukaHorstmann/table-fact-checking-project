Find the row corresponding to the specified date: In this table, each row represents a different game and the 'date' column provides the dates of these games. The row we are looking for has the date \"september 26 , 1971\". In the provided table, this row is at index 2.\n\n3. Check the attendance in the corresponding cell: Once we have identified the correct row, we should check the 'attendance' column to find out how many people attended the game on that date.\n\n4. Compare the result with the claim: Now that we know the number of attendees from the table (which is 57895 in this case), we can compare it with the expected attendance stated in the claim. If both numbers are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nIn JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and find the relevant date\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the specified date in the table\",\n    \"Check the attendance column for the identified row\",\n    \"Compare the result with the claimed attendance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
