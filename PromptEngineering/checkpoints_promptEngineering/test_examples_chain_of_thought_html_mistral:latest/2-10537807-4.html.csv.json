I also see that \"pounding\", \"caught by the river\", and \"black and white town\" belong to the album \"the last broadcast\".\n\n4. Further, I find that \"snowden\" and \"sky starts falling\" are part of the album \"some cities\".\n\n5. Lastly, I see that \"kingdom of rust\" and \"winter hill\" are also part of the album \"some cities\".\n\n6. Now, I will compare this list with all the songs mentioned in the claim to check if there is any song from the list that does not belong to \"some cities\".\n\n7. The only song left in the claim that I haven't found in the table is \"andalucia\". Since \"andalucia\" is part of the album \"the places between : the best of doves\", which is different from \"some cities\", the claim does not hold true for all songs.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Go through the table to find the song and album information.\",\n    \"List down all songs in the claim.\",\n    \"Compare the list of songs in the claim with the albums from the table.\",\n    \"Check if any song in the claim does not belong to 'some cities'.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"album\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"album\" }\n  ]\n}",
