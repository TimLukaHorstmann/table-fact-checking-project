Similarly, for Hot Child in the City, it's on row 29 (since the first row is 0) and the column is \"Song\".\n\n2. Find out the number of weeks each song spent at the top. For MacArthur Park, the number of weeks is not explicitly stated but since it shares a row with another song, we can assume that its total weeks are less than 4 (as the maximum number of weeks for the same row is 4). For Hot Child in the City, the number of weeks is also not explicitly stated, but it is shared with another song, so its total weeks should also be less than 4.\n\n3. Compare the number of weeks each song spent at the top. Since we can't definitively say how many weeks each song was at the top based on the information provided, we cannot determine if they have the same number of weeks at the top.\n\n4.
