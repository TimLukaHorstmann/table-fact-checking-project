The columns are: year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, winner 's share.\n2. Determine which row of the table corresponds to Jessica Shepley's victory. Since her name appears in the \"champion\" column for the 3rd row and the table shows all years starting from 2004, I can assume that this is the year she won.\n3. Check the values in the \"winner 's share\" column to see if they match with Jessica Shepley's reported winnings (14000) when she won.

    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that after 2012, the winner's share was never less than 15000.\n\n2. Determine the relevant data: I will focus on the rows of the table that represent years after 2012 to check if the winner's share in those years is greater than or equal to 15000.\n\n3. Review the data for each row: Starting from 2013, I will look at the \"winner 's share\" column for each year.\n\n4. Compare with the claim: If the winner's share in any of the years after 2012 is less than 15000, then the claim is false. If it is equal to or greater than 15000 in all of those years, then the claim is true.\n\nWith this reasoning in mind, let's check the relevant cells:\n\n- For year 2013, the winner 's share was 15000 (row_index=0).\n- For year 2014, there are no data provided, so I cannot compare.\n- For year 2015 and onwards, there are no data available in this table, so I cannot compare further.\n\nSince the winner 's share for the year 2013 (the first year after 2012 with data) was equal to 15000, and we don't have enough information to determine if it holds true for later years, let's output our answer as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is that after 2012 the winner 's share was never less than 15000.

Identify the relevant data from the table: The table provides data on various golf tournaments held between 2004 and 2013, including year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner's share.\n\n2.

Check if there is any row where the winner's share is less than 15400: From the provided data, we can see that all the 'winner's share' values after 2012 are greater than or equal to 15400. For instance, in 2013 the 'winner's share' is 15000, in 2012 it's 15000, and so on for each year after that.\n\n4.
