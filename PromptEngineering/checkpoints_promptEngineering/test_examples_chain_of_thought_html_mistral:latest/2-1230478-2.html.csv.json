Since the data provided doesn't mention the artist's name explicitly, we can infer that it's Phyllis Nelson based on the songs listed (don't stop the train, move closer, and its re-issue).\n2. Next, check which years the given songs were released. We find that don't stop the train was released in 1981, and the song move closer has two entries: 1985 (original release) and 1994 (re-issue).\n3. The US Hot 100 chart data is not provided for Phyllis Nelson in the given table; however, we can observe that for a song to be on the US Hot 100, it needs to have an entry in the \"us hot 100\" column with a non-empty value.\n4. Looking at the table, we find that move closer (1985 and 1994) doesn't have any entries in the \"us hot 100\" column. However, both i don't know (1985) and i like you (1985) have entries in the \"us hot 100\" column with values 61.\n5. Since there are no other songs of Phyllis Nelson in the table with entries in the \"us hot 100\" column, we can conclude that she made it to the US Hot 100 only once (with i don't know and i like you) and not twice as claimed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the artist's name from the table\",\n    \"Check which years the given songs were released\",\n    \"Determine the criteria for a song to be on the US Hot 100 chart\",\n    \"Examine the 'us hot 100' entries for each of Phyllis Nelson's songs\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The song \"i don't know\" has a value of 1 in the \"us dance\" column, while \"i like you\" does not have any value in this column (indicating that it might be unknown).\n3. Since the claim is about both songs hitting number 1 for us dance, we need to verify if either song did indeed hit number 1. We know from step 2 that \"i don't know\" has a value of 1, which means it reached number 1 in the US Dance chart.\n4. Check if there is any contradictory information about \"i like you\". Since we found no contradictory information about this song (as it does not have an entry in the \"us dance\" column), we cannot conclude that it did not reach number 1, given that there might be missing data or errors in the table.\n5. Given that we found evidence supporting both songs reaching number 1 for US Dance, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE for one of the songs and indeterminate for the other.

First, I identify the claim which states that only one of f Phyllis Nelson's single, \"Don't Stop The Train,\" made it to the US Dance chart but not the US Hot 100 or US R&B.\n2. Next, I locate all relevant rows in the table corresponding to the singles of f Phyllis Nelson. There are three entries for her songs: \"Don't Stop The Train\" (1981), \"Move Closer\" (1985 re-issue), and \"I Don't Know\", \"I Like You\" (both 1985).\n3. In each relevant row, I check the columns for the US Dance, US Hot 100, and US R&B charts.\n4. For the year 1981, \"Don't Stop The Train\" is found in the US Dance chart (20th position) and not in the US Hot 100 or US R&B columns (they are empty). This matches one of the conditions in the claim.\n5. For the years 1985, \"Move Closer\" (re-issue), \"I Don't Know\", and \"I Like You\" are all found in the table. None of these songs are in the US Dance chart; instead, they are positioned in the US Hot 100 or US R&B charts. This does not match the condition in the claim that none of her other singles made it to the US Dance chart.\n6. Since \"Don't Stop The Train\" meets one of the conditions (made it to the US Dance chart but not the US Hot 100 or US R&B) and none of her other songs meet the condition (not in the US Dance chart), it is reasonable to conclude that only one of f Phyllis Nelson's singles, \"Don't Stop The Train,\" made it to the US Dance chart but not the US Hot 100 or US R&B.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Locate relevant rows in table\", \"Check each column for relevant songs\", \"Analyze findings based on claim condition\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"single\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}]\n}",
