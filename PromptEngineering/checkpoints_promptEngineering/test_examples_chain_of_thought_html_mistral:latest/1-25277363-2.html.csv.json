In this table, the writer's name appears in the fourth column. The column header is \"Writer\" or \"Writer(s)\" since multiple writers can contribute to an episode.\n2. Scroll through the rows of the table until we reach the episode with a number 149. In this table, the numbering starts from 1 and episodes have no common pattern in their names, so we will rely on the \"No.\" column (Column 3) to find episode 149.\n3. Once we find episode 149, check the fourth column for the writer's name to see if it matches \"bob sand\".

Identify the table's structure: The table has two columns (No and Title) and rows representing TV episodes with their respective original air dates.\n2. Understand the claim: The claim states that \"fast friends\" originally aired on October 11, 1992.\n3. Find the relevant row for 'Fast Friends': Search through the table to find the episode titled 'Fast Friends'. The row index of this episode is found to be 58.\n4. Check the air date: Inspect the air date in the corresponding cell (row_index=58, column_name='Title'). However, as we can see from the table, the air date for 'Fast Friends' is not October 11, 1992 but rather January 16, 1994.\n5.
