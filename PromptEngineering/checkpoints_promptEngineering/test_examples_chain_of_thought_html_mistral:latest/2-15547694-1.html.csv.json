Identify the party with the second most members: To do this, we look for the party with the highest number of members less than 21. In our table, the parties have either 6, 9, or 21 members. Since 21 > 9, and there are no parties with 8 members, the party with the second most members is Fine Gael (row index 1) which has 9 members.\n3. Compare the number of members between the two parties: The difference between the number of members for Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael is 21 - 9 = 12.\n4. Check if this difference meets the claim: The claim states that the party with 21 total members has 9 more members than the party with the second most members.

Find out who the members of this group are - By examining the table, we can see that the national university of Ireland has one member (row with 'national university of ireland' as party), which is located in row 4 and column 'university of dublin'.\n3. Identify the parties - To check whether a group is mostly made up of members from 2 specific parties, we need to know those parties. Unfortunately, the claim does not specify the two parties. So, let's assume for now that it refers to the two parties with the highest number of appointments (Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael).\n4. Count the number of members from each party - To find out if the group in question is mostly made up of members from these two parties, we need to count the total number of members from each party and compare it to the number of members in the national university of Ireland.\n5. Compare the counts - If the count of members in the national university of Ireland is greater than or equal to the combined count of members from the two assumed parties, then the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.\n6. Implement the comparison - In our table:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il has 21 total appointments (7 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 21).\n   - Fine Gael has 9 total appointments (1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9).\n   - The national university of Ireland has one appointment.\n7.
