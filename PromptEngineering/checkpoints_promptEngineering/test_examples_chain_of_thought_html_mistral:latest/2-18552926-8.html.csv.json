Find the relevant data for the year 1996: Scan through the table and find the rows where the 'year' column has the value of 1996.\n3. Check the category for the claim: In the found rows, check if any of them have a 'category' with the description 'best actor in a leading role'.\n4. Identify the recipient for that category in the relevant year: If a row matches step 3, identify the value in the 'recipients and nominees' column of that row.\n5. Check the result for the found recipient: In the same row as the found recipient, check the value in the 'result' column.\n6.
