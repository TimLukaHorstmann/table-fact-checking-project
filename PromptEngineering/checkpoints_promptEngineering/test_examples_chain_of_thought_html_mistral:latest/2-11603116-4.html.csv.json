Identify relevant columns and rows from the table: To answer this question, we need to compare the earnings of Lee Trevino (row_index 5) and Gil Morgan (row_index 2) as well as their wins (column \"wins\").\n\n3. Compare the earnings and wins for each player: Compare the values in the \"earnings\" column for row 5 (Lee Trevino) with row 2 (Gil Morgan). Similarly, compare the values in the \"wins\" column for the same rows.\n\n4. Determine if the claim is true or false: If Lee Trevino's earnings are less than Gil Morgan's and he has 8 more wins, then the claim is true. If not, the claim is false.\n\nBased on the given table, we can see that Lee Trevino has fewer earnings (9616404) compared to Gil Morgan (11092593).

Extract the earnings and wins data for Hale Irwin from the table: For earnings, the value is $16950178 and for wins, the value is 36.\n4. Identify the player with the second highest earnings in the table: To do this, we need to compare the earnings of all players in the table excluding Hale Irwin (since he has the highest earnings). The player with the second-highest earnings is Gil Morgan with $11092593.\n5. Check if Hale Irwin has more wins than any other player: In this case, Hale Irwin has 36 wins which is higher than any other player in the table (the next highest number of wins belongs to Lee Trevino with 29 wins).\n6. Compare the results found in steps 4 and 5 against the claim: The claim states that Hale Irwin has the second-highest earnings and the most wins.
