Next, we need to verify if the score for that game is indeed 3 points for Minnesota (which would make the total points 18 as stated in the claim) and whether the attendance was 5307.\n\n4. In that row, under the 'visitor' column, it is confirmed that the team visiting Pittsburgh is Minnesota. The score in the 'score' column is 3-1 in favor of Minnesota, which means Minnesota scored 3 points (goals/runs/points might depend on the sport, but let's assume this table represents a sport where the scoring system works as mentioned).\n\n5. Under the 'attendance' column, it says 5307, which is the same as stated in the claim.\n\n6.
