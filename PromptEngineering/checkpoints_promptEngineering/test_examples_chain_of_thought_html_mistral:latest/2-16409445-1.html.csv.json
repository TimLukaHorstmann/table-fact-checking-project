Then, we need to check if the opponent \"new orleans saints\" appears for the first time in any of those games.\n3. In the table, each row represents a game and the opponent is listed in the second column. We compare this with the given claim that the opponent is \"new orleans saints\".\n4. To find out if it's the first appearance of the Saints, we look for the earliest occurrence of the opponent named \"new orleans saints\" in the table.\n5. In the table, the \"new orleans saints\" appear in the 11th row with a game date of November 9, 1997. We can confirm that this is the first time they appear as an opponent since we see earlier games (up to the 10th week) where the opponent is different.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find which opponents appear for the first time during game weeks in the table, check if 'new orleans saints' appears as an opponent for the first time, find the earliest occurrence of the Saints in the table to confirm their first appearance\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"second\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
