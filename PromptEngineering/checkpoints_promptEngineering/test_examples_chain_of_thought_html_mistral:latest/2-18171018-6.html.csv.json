Check the country of the player mentioned in the claim (the united states) and verify if it matches with the country in the table for that player.\n3. Confirm the position mentioned in the claim (t7 or 7th place tie) by counting the number of rows in the table with \"-2 to par\" score and compare it with the row index of the player we are checking.\n4. Ensure the score of the player (in this case, the sum of scores in the \"score\" column for each round) as calculated from the table matches with the score mentioned in the claim.\n5. If all the above steps are satisfied, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n- {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"} (for player gil morgan)\n- {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"} (for country of the player)\n- {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"to par\"} (for the score to par for the player)\n- {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"} (for the sum of scores in each round)\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
