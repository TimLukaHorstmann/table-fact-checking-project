Analyze the scores column of the home teams. The scores are listed as goal and behind totals (e.g., 13.16), where the number before the point is goals and the number after the point is behinds. Goals scored are worth more than behinds.\n\n3. Verify that no team has a score exceeding 110 points (ignoring the decimal part for simplicity).
