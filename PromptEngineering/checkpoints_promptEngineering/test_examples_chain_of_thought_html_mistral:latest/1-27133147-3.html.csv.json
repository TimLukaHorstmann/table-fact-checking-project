    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team whose position in the table was 10th and whose head coach resigned on 28 February 2011. From the table, it appears that 'beira - mar' fits this description.\n\n2. Check if there is any other team with similar conditions (position 10th and resignation on 28 February 2011). If found, it would mean multiple teams match the given claim, making the claim FALSE. However, no such team was found in the table.\n\n3. Since 'beira - mar' is the only team that meets the conditions, it implies that the date of vacancy for this team should also be on or before 28 February 2011 (as the resignation happened on that day). To find this, we need to look for the row where the team is 'beira - mar' and the manner of departure is 'resigned'.\n\n4. Find the date of vacancy for 'beira - mar'.
