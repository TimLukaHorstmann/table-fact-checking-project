Identify the claim: The claim is about a match between Cipolla (not provided in the table) and Sergio Roitman in Germany where the score was 7 - 5, 6 - 4.\n2. Compare the given table to the claim: There are no rows in the table that list Cipolla as the player on either side of the match.

Determine relevance of cells: The relevant cells are the ones that help us verify if the match mentioned in the claim is present in the table. In this case, the relevant cells are \"row_index\" = [1] and \"column_name\" = [\"opponent\", \"tournament\"] (as they contain information about opponent's name and tournament location).\n4.
