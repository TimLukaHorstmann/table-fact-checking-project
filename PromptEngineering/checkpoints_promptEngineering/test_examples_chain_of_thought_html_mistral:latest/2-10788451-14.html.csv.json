Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n- Richmond's away team score can be found in the second row, under the \"away team score\" column. The value is \"11.17 (83)\".\n- Fitzroy's away team score can be found in the sixth row, under the same column. The value is \"11.15 (81)\".\n- To compare these scores, we convert both to numbers by ignoring the parentheses and decimal points, resulting in 83 for Richmond and 81 for Fitzroy.\n- Since the difference between 83 and 81 is less than 2, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the away team scores for both Richmond and Fitzroy\",\n    \"Compare the two scores to check if the difference is equal to or greater than 2 points\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}",
