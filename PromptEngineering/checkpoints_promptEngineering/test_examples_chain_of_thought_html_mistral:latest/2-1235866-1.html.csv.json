Locate the row where the \"year\" value is equal to 1963, which is the first row in the table body (row_index = 0).\n3. Observe that the cell in the column labeled \"points\" for this row contains the value '0'.\n4. Compare the entrant team lotus with the data in the table by finding the rows where the \"entrant\" value is equal to team lotus (in this case, there's only one such row).\n5. Confirm that the row containing the entrant team lotus has the year 1963 and the points column contains the value '0'.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Examine table for relevant year, find corresponding rows, compare entrant team lotus data with table data, verify if points are 0 for the relevant row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Examine the table for each year's points earned by Team Lotus:\n   - In 1963, Team Lotus had 0 points (row index 0).\n   - In 1964, Team Lotus had 11 points (row index 1).\n   - In 1966, Team Lotus had 1 point in three different instances (rows 2, 3, and 4).\n\n3. Compare the number of years with less than 10 points to the claim:\n   - Only one year, 1963, has fewer than 10 points as per the table.\n\n4.
