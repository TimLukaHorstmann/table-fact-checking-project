Identify the claim's components: The claim states that the second leg score should be 3-0, and the year when San Pedro was the winner should be provided. However, since the question does not provide the specific year for San Pedro, I will look for all rows where the team name is 'San pedro'.\n\n2. Search for relevant rows: Scan through the table to find the rows where the team name is 'San pedro' and note down the row index(es) for each occurrence.\n\n3. Check the second leg scores: From the identified rows, check the cells under the 'Second Leg' column (column 7) to see if any of them match 3-0.\n\n4. Determine the answer: If a matching row is found, then the claim is either true for that specific year or false for all other years when San Pedro was the winner. If no such row is found, then the claim is false as there is no record of a 3-0 second leg score when San Pedro was the champion.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify components of the claim (score and year)\",\n    \"Search for rows where the team name is 'San pedro'\",\n    \"Check if any of those rows have a second leg score of 3-0\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is true or false based on the found match(es)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TBD\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n\nAfter searching through the table:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify components of the claim (score and year)\",\n    \"Search for rows where the team name is 'San pedro'\",\n    \"Check if any of those rows have a second leg score of 3-0\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is true or false based on the found match(es)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Second Leg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
