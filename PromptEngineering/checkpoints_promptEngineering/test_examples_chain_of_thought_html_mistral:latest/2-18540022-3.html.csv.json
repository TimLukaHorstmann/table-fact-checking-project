In the table, we see two Japanese titles that match the claimed title \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\". These are in rows 6 and 7.\n3. The relevant cells for comparison are:\n   - Row 6, Column \"japanese title\": \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\"\n   - Row 7, Column \"japanese title\": \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\"\n4. Since both of these Japanese titles match the claimed title, we can compare other columns to see if they are the same or not.\n5. In the table, we also see that for both rows 6 and 7, the value in the \"tv station\" column is \"tbs\". This matches with the claim as it's mentioned that \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" is aired on TBS.\n6. The other columns such as romaji title, episodes, and average ratings are not relevant to comparing the Japanese titles in this case.\n7.
