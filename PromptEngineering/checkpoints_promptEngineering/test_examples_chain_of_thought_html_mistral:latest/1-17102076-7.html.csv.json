    "resp": "1. First, identify the game number from the table provided. The game numbers are listed in the first column (Column 2).\n\n2. To check if this refers to game 35, we need to find the row where the value in Column 2 is 35. In the table, the 35th row corresponds to Columns 3-9.\n\n3. In these columns, we can see that the values represent the away team score (Column 4) and the home team score (Column 6). The values are separated by a hyphen (-), which indicates an overtime game.\n\n4. Since the value in Column 4 (away team score) for row 35 is \"90\", and there's no corresponding value in Column 6 (home team score), we can infer that the away team scored 90 points and the home team did not have a score.\n\n5. In an overtime game, the score will include both regular time and overtime. Since only the away team has a recorded score for this game, it implies that the final score is \"away team: 90, home team: 0 (in overtime)\".\n\n6.
