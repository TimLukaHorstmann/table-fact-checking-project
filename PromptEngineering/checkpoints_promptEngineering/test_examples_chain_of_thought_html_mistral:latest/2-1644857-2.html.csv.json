    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the country whose skip is \"craig brown\". In our table, there's only one row where the 'skip' column matches \"craig brown\", which is the second row with the country name \"scotland\".\n\n2. Next, we need to check if Scotland has stolen less than 9 ends. In the table, we can find the number of stolen ends for each country in the 'stolen ends' column. For Scotland, the number of stolen ends is 10. Since 10 > 9, the claim is not true based on this criteria.\n\nHowever, let's verify if there are any other relevant factors that could affect the claim. But since the provided table only includes data related to the number of ends won/lost, stolen, blank, and shot percentage, we can confidently conclude that the original claim is FALSE without needing to look further.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row where the 'skip' column matches 'craig brown'.\",\n    \"Check if the country with 'craig brown' as skip has stolen less than 9 ends.\",\n    \"If there are other factors affecting the claim, verify their values in the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"skip\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\" }\n  ]\n}",
