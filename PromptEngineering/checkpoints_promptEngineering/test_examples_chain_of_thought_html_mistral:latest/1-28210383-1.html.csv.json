Next, we scan the table for any rows where the \"directed by\" column has the value \"dan povenmire\".\n\n3. We find 4 such rows, with episode numbers: 20 (13), 89 (9), and 154 (7 / 8).\n\n4. Since there are 4 episodes directed by Dan Povenmire that are part of the \"road to\" series, we count how many of these are in the \"road to\" family guy episodes (episodes with titles containing \"road to\").\n\n5. We find that episodes 20 (13) and 89 (9) have titles containing \"road to\". Therefore, there are 2 \"road to\" family guy episodes directed by Dan Povenmire.\n\n6. Comparing our count with the claim, we see that the claim is slightly off: it states there should be 3 such episodes, but we found only 2.
