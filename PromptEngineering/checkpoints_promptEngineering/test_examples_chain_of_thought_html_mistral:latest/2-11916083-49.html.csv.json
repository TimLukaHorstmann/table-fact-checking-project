    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim is that the composition of an amethyst in 2008 is 99.99% silver with a price of 94.95.\n\n2. Find the relevant rows in the table based on the year mentioned in the claim (2008). In this table, there are two rows that match the year condition, but we need to check if either of them matches the theme and composition conditions as well.\n\n3. Check the theme column for both rows with 2008: One is 'amethyst crystal' and the other is 'sapphire crystal'. Since our claim mentions amethyst, we will focus on the first row that has the amethyst crystal theme.\n\n4. Verify the composition of the item in the composition column for the selected row (the amethyst crystal row). The given composition for this row is 99.99% silver. Since this matches the expected composition mentioned in the claim, we can proceed to the next step.\n\n5. Check the issue price of the item in the last column for the selected row (the amethyst crystal row). The given issue price for this row is 94.95. This also matches the expected price mentioned in the claim.\n\n6. Draw a conclusion based on the evidence: Since all conditions have been met, we can confirm that the claim is true for the given table.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the relevant rows based on the year mentioned in the claim (2008)\",\n    \"Check the theme column for both rows with 2008\",\n    \"Verify the composition of the item in the composition column for the selected row (the amethyst crystal row)\",\n    \"Check the issue price of the item in the last column for the selected row (the amethyst crystal row)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"composition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if there exists a row with the year matching our target (2008): In the table, I find two rows with the year 2008.\n3. Identify the theme column: The column we need to check is the \"theme\" column since it's related to the claim (the theme for 2008).\n4. Compare the themes in the table with our target theme (amethyst): In the first row of year 2008, the theme is not \"amethyst\". However, in the second row of year 2008, the theme is \"amethyst crystal\".\n5. Check if the issue price matches our target: The issue price for the row with the theme \"amethyst crystal\" is 94.95. This matches our target price (94.95).\n6. Combine the findings to determine whether the claim is true or false: Since both the year and the issue price match the claim, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, my final answer in a valid JSON object format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year we are looking for\", \"Check if there exists a row with the year matching our target\", \"Identify the theme column\", \"Compare the themes in the table with our target theme\", \"Check if the issue price matches our target\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}]\n}",

Once we have found the row, check the issue price value in the corresponding row.\n3. Compare the issue price with 95.
