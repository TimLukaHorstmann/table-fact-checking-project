    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which row of the table contains the Asian record. The Asian record has the same athlete (Saif Saaeed Shaheen from Qatar) as the world record, so we can start by focusing on that row.\n\n2. In this row, there is a cell with \"world record\" in the first column and \"Asian record\" in the fifth column. This confirms that this row indeed contains the Asian record.\n\n3. To confirm whether it was set on September 3rd, we need to check the date in the last column of this row. In the row containing the Asian record, the date is \"3 september 2004\".\n\n4. Since the given date matches with the date in the table, the claim that \"the asian record be set on September 3rd 2004\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the Asian record row by the athlete Saif Saaeed Shaheen (QAT), then compare the date in that row with the given claim date.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"3 september 2004\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the record types: There are several records mentioned in the table such as world record, championship record, world leading, African record, Asian record, North American record, South American record, European record.\n2. Understand the claim: The claim states that \"September 3, 2004\" is the date when Daniel Lincoln hit the Asian record.\n3. Find Daniel Lincoln's row in the table: In this case, since there are multiple rows with \"world\", \"championship\", \"world leading\", and other types of records, we need to focus on the rows where the second column (athlete name) matches \"Daniel lincoln\". There is no such row in the provided table.\n4. Check for Asian record dates: Review the remaining rows to see if any of them have the athlete whose name matches \"Saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\", who currently holds the Asian record. This is because, according to the table, there might be multiple instances where the same person holds different records on different dates.\n5. Find Saif Saaeed Shaheen's row in the table: Since \"Saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\" currently holds the Asian record, we should find his row in the table.\n6. Extract the date from the Asian record row: In the Asian record row, which is the fourth row of the table, the fifth column contains the date of the record.
