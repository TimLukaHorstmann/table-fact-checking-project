    "resp": "Here are the steps to follow for solving the problem:\n\n1. Identify the information required to verify the claim, which is the opponent's name and points at a specific date (March 13).\n2. Scan the table headers to find the columns that contain the necessary information. The \"opponent\" column provides the team names, while no clear column indicates the date. However, since it seems like the games are listed chronologically based on the game number, we can assume March 13 corresponds to game 68 or higher as those rows appear later in the table.\n3. Examine each row after row 67 to find the team name and points that match the claim's opponent (\"Toronto Maple Leafs\") and points (63). To check if a team's points change between rows, look for any discrepancy in the \"points\" column for the corresponding opponent.\n4. If a match is found, the next step is to confirm whether the opponent's name and points indeed correspond to March 13. Since we have no concrete date information and are assuming that games are listed chronologically, this verification is not possible based on the given data. However, for completeness, note that if the team's points remain consistent in the rows following 67, it would suggest they were playing on or after March 13.\n5.
