The table has rows with labels \"r3\", \"r3 replay\", \"r4\", \"r4 replay\", ..., \"sf\". Since \"r6 replay\" is not present directly, we look for the replay of r6. The replay rows are named in the format \"<round> replay\". In this case, the relevant row index is 6 (as r6 has no replay in the table).\n2. Check if the home/away (h/a) value for the identified row is 'h'. In the sixth row, under the 'h/a' column, we find 'a'. Therefore, the h/a for this round is not 'h'.\n3. Since the h/a condition in the claim is not met, there is no need to check the result (0-1).\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row for r6 replay by looking for its replay in the table\",\n    \"Check if the h/a value for the identified row is 'h'\",\n    \"Find that the h/a value for r6 replay is 'a', so the claim does not hold true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"h/a\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
