If yes, then move to step 3. If no, then the statement is FALSE because the condition of being \"when marseille be the first team\" is not met.\n3. Check the column header for the team name (column \"team 1\"). In this table, the team names alternate between \"team 1\" and \"team 2\". Since Marseille is listed in the \"team 1\" column of row 9, the condition of being \"the first team\" is met.\n4. Now check the \"1st leg\" column for the row where Marseille is \"team 1\". In this table, the \"1st leg\" score for Marseille as \"team 1\" (row 9) is indeed 3 - 1.\n5. Since both conditions (Marseille being \"the first team\" and the \"1st leg's score be 3 - 1\") are met, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team in the claim (Marseille)\", \"Determine if Marseille is listed as 'team 1'\", \"Check the '1st leg' column for the row where Marseille is 'team 1'\", \"Compare the '1st leg' score with the claimed score (3 - 1)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}]\n}",

Check the scores for the first leg (1st leg column) and the second leg (2nd leg column) for the selected row.\n4. Compare the values in the first leg and second leg columns for the selected row.
