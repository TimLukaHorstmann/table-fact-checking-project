Check the date: For each row found, verify that the \"date\" column contains a value close to June 2008 (to account for potential differences in formatting).\n\n4.

Compare the scores for each match (the score column).\n3. In the 2011 match, the score was 3-0, while in the 2013 match, the score was 2-1.\n4. Determine which team won each match by comparing the total scores and the result (sum of score and additional goals if any). The team with the higher total score is considered the winner. In the 2011 match, the home team scored 3 goals and the away team didn't score, so the home team had a total of 3 points, while the away team had 0 points. In the 2013 match, the home team scored 2 goals, and the away team scored 1 goal, resulting in a total of 3 points for the home team and 1 point for the away team.\n5. Compare the points scored by the winning teams (higher total score - result) in each match. In the 2011 match, the home team had a total of 3 points, while in the 2013 match, the home team also had a total of 3 points. However, since we are interested in the difference between the points scored by the winning teams, and since both games resulted in the same number of points for the winners, this comparison does not help us determine whether the claim is true or false.\n6. To properly assess the claim, we need to find a different way to compare the scores that takes into account the fact that in football, a team gets 3 points for a win and 0 points for a loss. Therefore, instead of comparing total points scored by each team, we will compare the difference between the teams' points (3 points for a win and 0 points for a loss) at the end of the match.\n7. In the 2011 match, the home team won with a score of 3-0, so they would have earned 3 points. Since the away team lost, they wouldn't earn any points. Therefore, the difference in points between the teams is 3 (home team) - 0 (away team) = 3 points.\n8. In the 2013 match, the home team won with a score of 2-1, so they would have earned 3 points. Since the away team lost, they wouldn't earn any points. Therefore, the difference in points between the teams is 3 (home team) - 0 (away team) = 3 points.\n9. Compare the differences in points between the winning teams of each match. The difference in points for the 2011 match was 3 points, while for the 2013 match it was also 3 points. However, since we are interested in finding out whether more points were scored by the winning team in the 2011 match than in the 2013 match, and since both matches had the same difference in points, this comparison does not help us determine whether the claim is true or false.\n10. To properly assess the claim, we need to compare the total points scored by the winning team in each match. In the 2011 match, the home team won with a score of 3-0 and earned 3 points. In the 2013 match, the home team also won but only with a score of 2-1, earning 3 points.\n11. Compare the total points scored by the winning teams in each match. The total points scored by the winning team in the 2011 match was 6 (3 goals + 3 points for the win), while in the 2013 match it was only 3 points (2 goals + 3 points for the win).\n12. Based on our comparison, we can conclude that more points were scored by the winning team in the 2011 match than in the 2013 match, since the total points scored by the winning team in the 2011 match was higher (6) compared to the 2013 match (3).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant matches\",\n    \"Compare scores and results for each match\",\n    \"Determine winning teams\",\n    \"Calculate difference in points for each winning team\",\n    \"Compare differences in points between winning teams\",\n    \"Compare total points scored by winning teams\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
