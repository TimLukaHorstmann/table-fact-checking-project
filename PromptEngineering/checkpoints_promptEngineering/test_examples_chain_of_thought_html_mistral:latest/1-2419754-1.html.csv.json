Next, we need to find if these institutions were members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). Since there is no direct mention of the conference membership in the table, we would need additional information to verify this claim. However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume that a member of the GMC would have joined and left during the specified years (1991-1995) in the table.\n\n3. In our final step, we check if there are at least two institutions from Ohio that were members of the GMC during 1991-1995 by looking at the 'joined' and 'left' columns for rows 1 and 2.
