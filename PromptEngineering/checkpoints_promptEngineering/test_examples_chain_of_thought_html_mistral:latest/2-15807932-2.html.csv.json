    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The claim states that South Korea earned no gold medal in the competition.\n2. Identify the relevant data in the table: The table provides data about the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won by different nations. To verify the claim, we will focus on the row related to South Korea.\n3. Check the gold column for South Korea's row: In the table, the gold column for South Korea's row contains a value of 0.\n4. Determine whether the claim is true or false based on the data: Since the claimed condition (winning at least one gold medal) does not match the observed data (South Korea has 0 gold medals), the claim can be considered as TRUE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim to verify\",\n    \"Identify relevant data in the table\",\n    \"Check the gold column for South Korea's row\",\n    \"Determine whether the claim is true or false based on the data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
