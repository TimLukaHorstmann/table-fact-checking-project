In our table, it can be found in the 8th row with the \"name\" column containing the text \"total forest area\".\n\n2. Verify the value of the year for this variable in the table. The year for total forest area is located in the 5th column and has a value of 2007.\n\n3. Determine if there exists another row with the same year but a different variable (total forest area) that we can compare it to. In our table, there are no other rows with a year matching 2007 for any other variable.\n\n4. If there is no other comparable row, then the ranking of total forest area in 2007 cannot be determined because there's no basis for comparison within the provided data. However, since we have been asked to find the rank higher than 50 out of 220, it follows that if there is no ranking available, the claim would be false.\n\n5.
