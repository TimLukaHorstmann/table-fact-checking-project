Identify the claim: The claim states that Austria ranks highest due to the number of medals, yet was the only country to win bronze in the 1961 world luge championship.\n\n2. Determine the ranking based on total medals: To find out if Austria ranks highest, we look at the 'total' column and compare the values. The higher the total medal count, the higher the rank. In this table, Austria has 3 medals (1 bronze), Italy has 2 medals, West Germany has 2 medals, Poland has 1 medal, and Switzerland has 1 medal. Therefore, Austria ranks highest based on total medals.\n\n3. Check if Austria won the most bronze: To confirm that Austria was the only country to win a bronze medal, we look at the 'bronze' column and count the number of bronze medals each nation won. In this table, only Austria won a bronze medal. So, it is correct to say that Austria was the only country to win a bronze medal in the championship.\n\n4.
