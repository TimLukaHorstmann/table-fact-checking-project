    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. First, we identify the column in the table that contains the player's country information. In this case, it's the 'country' column.\n2. Next, we search for the row that corresponds to Justin Rose. We can do this by looking for a player with the name \"justin rose (a)\" which is present in the second-to-last row of the table.\n3. Since the country of Justin Rose is mentioned as 'england' in the 'country' column, we compare this information to the claim that he is from the United States.\n4. Comparing the country mentioned in the table with the claim reveals that they do not match, so the claim is FALSE.\n5. Finally, we provide a list of relevant cells in case they are needed for future reference:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the 'country' column\", \"Search for Justin Rose by name\", \"Compare the country mentioned with the claim\", \"Compare does not match\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Compare the position of Thomas Bj\u00f8rn (t6) and Tiger Woods (t6) in the table. Since they are at the same row index, they have the same position in the rankings.\n2. Check the score of both players. Thomas Bj\u00f8rn has a total score of 215, while Tiger Woods also has a total score of 215.\n3. Determine whether one player's score is lower than the other when taking into account the par score. The par score for each round isn't provided in the table, but it can be assumed that if two players have the same total score, they also have the same number of strokes over or under par. In this case, since both players have the same total score (215), neither is ranked lower based on their scores alone.\n4. Consider any other relevant information that could help determine the ranking. The table does not provide any additional information that would affect the ranking.\n\nSince Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods are at the same position in the rankings (t6), they have the same rank, and neither is ranked lower than the other.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare positions of Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods in the table (same position, t6).\", \"Check their total scores (both have a score of 215).\", \"Determine whether one player's score is lower than the other when taking into account the par score.
