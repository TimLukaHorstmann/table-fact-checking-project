If so, it is possible that during the period of 1973 to 1986, BB Pilipinas - Tourism was not yet awarded or introduced.\n4. Check the table for the presence of BB Pilipinas - Tourism title: The table shows that BB Pilipinas - Tourism started being awarded from 1987 onwards.

In the table, we find that Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando participated in Binibining Pilipinas - Universe 1991 under the \"not awarded\" category for their placement.\n5.
