    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to sort the table by the 'round' column in ascending order to easily check for players from Tennessee State with a rank lower than 261.\n\n2. After sorting, we look through the sorted table row by row starting from the top (round 1). If we find a player from Tennessee State at any round less than 10, then the claim is FALSE as there would be at least one player with a rank lower than 261 (the lowest rank in our table is 10).\n\n3. In our sorted table, we see that the first row doesn't have a player from Tennessee State (school/club team is Houston). We continue to the next rows until we reach Tennessee State players. This happens at round 11 with John Henry Smith (row_index=25).\n\n4. Since we haven't found any Tennessee State players with a rank less than 261, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Sort table by 'round' column in ascending order\", \"Check each row starting from the top for a Tennessee State player at any round less than 10\", \"Continue until we reach Tennessee State players, which happen at round 11 (row_index=25)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
