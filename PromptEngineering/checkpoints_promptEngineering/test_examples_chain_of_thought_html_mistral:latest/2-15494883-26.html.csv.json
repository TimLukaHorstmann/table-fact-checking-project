Determine how to verify the claim: To verify the claim, we need to check if there's any row (airport) where the 'annual change' is negative. If there's at least one such airport, then the claim is false; otherwise, it's true.\n\n4. Iterate through each row of the table: Start from the first row and move to the next one until the end of the table.\n\n5. Verify if the 'annual change' for the current airport is negative: For each row, look at the value in the 'annual change' column (column 3).
