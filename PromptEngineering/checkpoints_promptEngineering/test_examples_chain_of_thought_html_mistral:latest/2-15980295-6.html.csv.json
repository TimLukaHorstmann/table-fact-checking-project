According to the table, the plural form of a singular word is found in the 'plural' column. The value in the 'plural' column for the identified row (row index 9) is 'xweer (a) du'.\n\n3. Compare both forms. To verify the claim, we compare the singular form with the supposed plural form given in the claim ('xweera' vs 'xweer (a) du').\n\n4. Determine whether the claim is true or false. If the plural form of the word matches the one given in the claim, then the claim is true.
