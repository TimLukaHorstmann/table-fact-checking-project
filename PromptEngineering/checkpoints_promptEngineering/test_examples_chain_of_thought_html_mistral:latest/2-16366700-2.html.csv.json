Find the relevant rows: We need to find the row that corresponds to Bill Mosienko, which has a \"name\" of \"bill mosienko\".\n\n4.

Compare the data: To determine if Bill Mosienko has scored the fewest number of postseason goals, we need to compare this value with the other players' playoff points in the table.\n\n6.
