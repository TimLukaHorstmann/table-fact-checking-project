    "resp": "1. Identify the teams involved in the round of 16: From the table, we can see that matches involving division 1 (d1) teams are considered as the round of 16. The teams in the round of 16 are rc lens, fc rouen, as monaco, girondins de bordeaux, fc nantes, as cannes, sporting toulon var, and fc metz.\n\n2. Extract the scores for each team: We need to find out how many goals each team scored in total during the 1st round and 2nd round of the matches between these division 1 teams. We will compare these scores to determine which team scored the most goals.\n\n   Here is the data we extract from the table:\n\n   - rc lens: 1 goal (1-0, 1st round) + 0 goals (0-0, 2nd round) = 1 goal\n   - fc rouen: 4 goals (2-4, total score)\n   - as monaco: 6 goals (6-1, total score)\n   - girondins de bordeaux: 5 goals (2-3, total score)\n   - fc nantes: 8 goals (4-4, total score)\n   - as cannes: 5 goals (4-1, total score)\n   - sporting toulon var: 3 goals (2-1, total score)\n   - fc metz: 6 goals (5-1, total score)\n\n3.

Determine the answer: The claim states that \"as monaco score the most goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france\".

We check if there is any other match between these two teams, but there aren't any more rows for either team with Nantes or Lyon as their opponent.\n\n4. Since both rounds resulted in a draw and there are no additional matches to consider, the aggregate score over two legs is indeed 4 - 4.\n\n5. The away goal rule comes into play only when the teams have scored an equal number of goals in each other's home stadium (or if one team has scored more away goals than their opponent has scored at home). In this case, since both rounds were played at Nantes (1st round) and Lyon (2nd round), there are no away goals to consider.\n\nSince the aggregate score is 4 - 4 and there are no away goals, we do not need to apply the away goal rule to decide the outcome of the match.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams involved in the claim\",\n    \"Find relevant rows based on team names\",\n    \"Check scores for each round for both teams\",\n    \"Check if there are any additional matches between the teams\",\n    \"Evaluate the need for the away goal rule\",\n    \"Determine if the aggregate score matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 2\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team 2\" }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the claim: The claim states that only one goal was scored by an away team in the first leg, and it specifically mentions that FCSM (FC Mulhouse) scored 1 against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\n2. Understand the context: We are given a table of soccer matches where each row represents a match, with columns for team 1, score, team 2, and results from the first two rounds. The matches are organized by division (d1 for Ligue 1 teams and d2 for Ligue 2 teams).\n\n3. Check for other goals scored by away teams: To verify if only one goal was scored by an away team in the first leg, we need to go through each row where team 2 is from a lower division (d2) and check the score in the first round (1st round column).\n\n4. Verify the claim about FCSM and Girondins de Bordeaux: Since we are interested in the specific match between Girondins de Bordeaux (team 1) and FCSM (team 2), we look for this row in the table. In the first round, we can see that FCSM scored 1 against Girondins de Bordeaux (1-0).\n\n5. Analyze the results: After checking all rows where team 2 is from a lower division and verifying the score in the first round, we find only one instance of an away team scoring a goal during the first leg - FCSM against Girondins de Bordeaux (which is exactly what the claim states). No other goal was scored by an away team in the first leg.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Understand the context\", \"Check for other goals scored by away teams\", \"Verify the claim about FCSM and Girondins de Bordeaux\", \"Analyze the results\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Next, look for a row where the sum of the goals for both teams equals 8. However, after examining all rows in the table, no row has a sum of 8 goals in the \"score\" column.\n3. Realize that the claim is asking about the highest scoring leg (one-time event) and the highest aggregate score (total goals scored over two legs), not necessarily the same match with an 8-goal total.\n4. To find the highest scoring leg, look for rows where one team scored more than the other team but both teams have scores in the \"score\" column. In this table, there are multiple examples like this: rc lens vs rc strasbourg (1 - 0), fc rouen vs stade lavallois (2 - 4), as monaco vs as nancy (6 - 1), and so on.\n5. To find the highest aggregate score, look for rows where the absolute difference between the scores of both teams is at least 5 (since we want a significant goal difference). In this table, the row with fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais has an absolute difference of 4 goals (4 - 1), but there are other rows where the difference is greater.\n6. Recall that the claim does not specify which round these matches were from, so we need to consider all rounds equally.\n7.

Therefore, we can infer that the matches played by as monaco correspond to the round of 16.\n\n3. Verify if scores are fewer for as monaco in the round of 16: To check this, compare the total goals scored by as monaco in both '1st round' and '2nd round' with any other round scores (if available).

For Fc Nantes, the 2nd round score is 4-4 (row index 5). For Fc Mulhouse, the team Girondins de Bordeaux played against both in the 1st round and they scored 3-2 in that match. Since Fc Mulhouse was on the away side for that match, we can consider their score as 2-3. However, there's no record of a 2nd round match for Fc Mulhouse in the table.\n5.
