    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I need to understand the claim being made. The claim states that Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers both beat their competition by a score of 3 points. However, it's important to note that football matches are typically won based on goals (not points), so we should interpret this claim as both teams winning with a score of 3-0 (three goals scored without any goals conceded).\n\n2. Next, I need to verify the data in the table for each match to determine if any team scored exactly three goals.\n\n   - In the first row, Manchester United beat Watford with a score of 2-0, so they did not win by 3 goals.\n   - In the second row, Stoke City won against Everton by 3-2, which does not match the claimed condition.\n   - In the third row, the match between Birmingham City and Stoke City ended in a draw (0-0), followed by a penalty shootout where Stoke City won. This game also does not meet the claimed condition.\n   - In the fourth row, Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Arsenal 3-1, which matches the claimed condition for one team.\n   - In the fifth row, Burnley beat Leicester City 1-0, so they did not win by 3 goals.\n\n3. Finally, I need to compare the number of games that meet and do not meet the claimed condition. Only one game (Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Arsenal) meets the claimed condition, while all other games do not.
