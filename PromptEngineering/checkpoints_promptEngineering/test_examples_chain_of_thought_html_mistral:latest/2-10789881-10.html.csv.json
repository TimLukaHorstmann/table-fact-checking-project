For each row, compare the home team score with the value 10.00 (since the scores are given in a format like \"8.10 (58)\" where the number before the decimal point represents the total points without goals and the number after the decimal point represents goals). To do this, convert the scores to integers by removing the fractional part of the scores for both home team score and 10.00.\n3. If the integer value of the home team score is greater than 10 (for any row), that particular match's home team has a higher score than 10.00.\n4. Count the number of rows where the home team score is greater than 10.00.\n5. Compare this count with the total number of rows, which should be equal to or less than 3 since there are at most 6 teams playing on a given day and each team can only have one match per day.\n\nNow let's find out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE using the obtained information:\n\n1.
