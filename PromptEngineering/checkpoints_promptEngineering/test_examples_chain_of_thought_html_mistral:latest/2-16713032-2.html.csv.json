The 'week' column provides the week number for each game, so we look for the row where the 'week' value is 5. In this table, the relevant row is row_index=6.\n2. Next, we confirm that the result of the game in row 6 is a loss ('l') and the score was 24-20. We check the 'result' column in row 6 for the specific format of the score (w - x or l - y), where w is the number of points scored by our team and x/y are the points scored against our team. In this case, the score matches the specified criteria.\n3. Finally, we confirm that the attendance for the game in row 6 is 60488. We check the 'attendance' column in row 6 and find that it indeed equals 60488.\n\nThe final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row corresponding to week 5, check if the result matches the specified criteria ('l' and specific score), and confirm that the attendance is as specified (60488)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": 'result'}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": 'attendance'}]\n}",
