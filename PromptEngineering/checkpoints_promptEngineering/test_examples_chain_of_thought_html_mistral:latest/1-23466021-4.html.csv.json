Verify the result of the match: Confirm that the score of the match on October 20 is 34-27 in favor of the Stampeders. The relevant cells are row 15, columns \"Score 1\" and \"Score 2\".\n\n5. Verify the team's record after the match: If the Stampeders won the match on October 20, their record should be updated to 11 wins, 5 losses.

Identify the claim details: The claim states that on August 27, the Lions win at Skydome Stadium with a score of 34 - 25, improving their record to 6 - 2.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to August 27 in the table: To do this, we need to look for the date that matches August 27. The date column is not present in the table, but we can assume that the games are listed chronologically (from left to right and top to bottom).\n\n3. Verify the team playing on August 27: By reading the opponent's name in each row starting from the top, we find the Lions (Opponent column) on the 9th row.\n\n4. Check the stadium where the game was played: The location of the game is given in the \"stadium\" column. We can see that it is indeed Skydome Stadium for the Lions vs Tiger-Cats game on August 27 (row 9).\n\n5. Verify the score of the game: In the table, the columns represent dates and the rows represent teams. The scores are listed in the \"score\" column. We find that the Lions scored 52 points and their opponents, the Tiger-Cats, scored 25 points (row 9).\n\n6. Verify the improvement in the record: After checking the score of the game, we need to verify if the Lions' record improved to 6 - 2. In the table, the \"record\" is shown as part of the team's overall statistics, and it can be seen that the Lions have a record of 7 wins and 3 losses by the end of the game on October 27 (row 16).
