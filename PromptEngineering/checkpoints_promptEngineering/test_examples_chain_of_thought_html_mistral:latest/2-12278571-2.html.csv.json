Find the players with a t12 finish: In the table, there are three players with a 'finish' of t12 - Tiger Woods (row index 2), Ben Curtis (row index 1) and Ernie Els (row index 0).\n\n3. Check the total for each player: For Tiger Woods, the total is 282, for Ben Curtis it is 281, and for Ernie Els it is 279.\n\n4. Compare the totals with the claim: The highest total among those who finished t12 is indeed 282 (by Tiger Woods). However, the player that achieved this total is from the United States, not South Africa (as claimed).\n\n5.
