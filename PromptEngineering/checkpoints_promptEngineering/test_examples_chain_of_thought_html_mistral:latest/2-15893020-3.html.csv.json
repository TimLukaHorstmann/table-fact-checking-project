Find Deon Kruis' row in the table, which has a header \"deon kruis\" under the \"Player\" column and row number 12.\n3. Look for the \"Average\" column (column name: \"Avg\") to find Deon Kruis' average. However, there is no value provided for his average. Instead, it says \"n / a\".\n4. Since the table does not provide an average for Deon Kruis, we cannot determine if his average is 0.1 or not based on the given information.\n5. To verify our conclusion, let's check the structure of the average values provided in the table. The format seems to be consistent: it lists the number of innings (Inns), runs scored (R), and fours and sixes hit (4s & 6s) under each player. Using these numbers, we calculate the batting average as Runs / [(Runs + (4s * 4) + (6s * 6)) / Innings]. None of the players in the table have an \"n / a\" value for their average.\n6. Given that Deon Kruis' average is missing, it is impossible to confirm or deny if his average is 0.1 based on the provided table data.\n\nanswer: FALSE\nrelevant_cells: [ { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Avg\" } ]",
