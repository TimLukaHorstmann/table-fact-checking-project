To determine if a player with a career from 1946 - 1960 exists, we need to scan the table and check for the row(s) where \"First Year\" is between 1946 and 1960.\n3. We observe that there are two players in this range: Ray Lindwall (row index 7) and Clarrie Grimmett (row index 20). However, Clarrie Grimmett's career ended before 1960, so he doesn't fit the criteria.\n4. We then focus on Ray Lindwall and check if his total number of matches is 61 and his runs conceded is over 2727.2 and under 6704.\n5.
