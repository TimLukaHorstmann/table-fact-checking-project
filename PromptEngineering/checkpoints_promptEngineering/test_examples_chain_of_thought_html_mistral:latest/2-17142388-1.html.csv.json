Iterate through each row in the table (ignoring the header row): For each row, compare its 'from' cell with the date of the exception specified in the claim (18 July 1968). If they match, set `exception_index` to the current row index.\n4. After iterating through all rows and setting `exception_index`, check if it has a value: If `exception_index` is defined, that means we have found the exception, and we can move on to Step 5. Otherwise, proceed to Step 6.\n5. Examine the tail code of the row with `exception_index`: Compare its 'tail code' cell with 'np - 3xx'. If they match, then the table supports the claim that the exception does occur as expected. The final answer is \"TRUE\". Otherwise, there seems to be a discrepancy in the data and the final answer would be \"FALSE\".\n6. If `exception_index` was never defined after iterating through all rows, that means the table doesn't contain an entry with the 'from' date specified in the exception (18 July 1968).

Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim's conditions\",\n    \"Verify the conditions by checking each row in the table for the specified dates\",\n    \"Compare the conditions with the verified data\",\n    \"Determine if both conditions are met\",\n    \"Find that only one condition is met, so the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"from\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"area\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"from\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"area\" }\n  ]\n}",
