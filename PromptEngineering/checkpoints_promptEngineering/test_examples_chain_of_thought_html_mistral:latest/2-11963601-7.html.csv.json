    "resp": "Here are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the rows where Manu Ginobili is the leading scorer. In the given table, there are two such rows: 6th row (february 6 , 2008) and 13th row (february 13 , 2008).\n\n2. Next, we need to check the score for each of these games. According to the table, on February 6, 2008, the Spurs scored 85 points and their opponent, the Wizards, scored 77 points. On February 13, 2008, the Spurs scored 112 points while their opponents, the Cavaliers, scored 105 points.\n\n3. Now, we compare the scores from step 2 with the claimed score (100 - 99). We do not find a match in this comparison.\n\n4. Based on our analysis, since there is no row in the table where Manu Ginobili scored exactly 44 points and the game ended with a score of 100-99, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where Manu Ginobili is the leading scorer.\",\n    \"Check scores for each of these games to see if they match the claimed score (100-99).\",\n    \"Compare the scores from step 2 with the claimed score and verify there's no match.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
