    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the team mentioned in the claim, which is the one with 473 points against (row index can be found by searching for 473 under the \"points against\" column).\n\n2. Find the row where the \"points against\" value equals 473. The relevant row in this table is row 10 (bp rfc).\n\n3. Check if the number of matches played by this team is less than 22. In this case, we can see that there are 22 columns in the table, which means each row represents data for a single match. Therefore, the number of matches played by any team is equal to the number of rows in the table (in this case, 22), so it's not possible for a team to play less than 22 matches in this dataset.\n\n4. Since the condition mentioned in the claim cannot be verified using the data provided, it is not meaningful to determine whether the claim is true or false. However, we can say that there are inconsistencies in the given information which makes it impossible to verify the claim as stated.\n\nNow, let's represent this explanation in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team with 473 points against\",\n    \"Find the row where 'points against' equals 473\",\n    \"Check if the number of matches played is less than 22\",\n    \"Recognize that it is not meaningful to verify the claim due to inconsistencies in the given information\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"Not Meaningful\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points against\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"matches played\" }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the relevant columns for this claim: points (total points scored), bonus for points (bonus points earned for scoring 4 tries or more in a match).\n2.
