    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that a cardinal - deacon has the title of deacon of s Lorenzo in Lucina.\n2. Extract relevant information from the table: We need to find all rows where the 'elector' type is 'cardinal - deacon'. This will give us a list of all cardinal - deacons in the table.\n3. Check each cardinal - deacon's title: For each cardinal - deacon, we'll examine the 'title' column to see if any of them have the title of 'deacon of s Lorenzo in Lucina'.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Extract relevant information from table\", \"Check each cardinal - deacon's title\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"elector\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
