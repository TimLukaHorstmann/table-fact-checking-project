Find the table rows for each earthquake that occurred in 1953: In this case, there is only one earthquake that happened in 1953, and it is located in row index 70.\n3. Check the value of the magnitude column for the identified row: In this case, the magnitude for the earthquake at row 70 is 6.5 (column name \"magnitude\").\n4. Compare the claim with the found value: The claimed magnitude was 6.5 and the found value matches the claim exactly.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the table rows for each earthquake that occurred in 1953\", \"Check the value of the magnitude column for the identified row\", \"Compare the claim with the found value\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"}]\n}",

Next, I will check the \"magnitude\" column for each of these earthquakes to see if any of them have a magnitude of exactly 6.5.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify all earthquakes before February 12, 1953\", \"Check the 'magnitude' column for each identified earthquake to see if it equals 6.5\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"}]\n}\n\nExplanation: The earthquake that occurred on February 12, 1953 is not included in the table due to its date being after all other listed earthquakes. However, there is an earthquake listed with a magnitude of 6.5 which happened on August 5, 1947 (row 46). This earthquake was before February 12, 1953, making the claim true.",
