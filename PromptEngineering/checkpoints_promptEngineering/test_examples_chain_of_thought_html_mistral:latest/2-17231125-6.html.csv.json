    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the score for player Larry Mize and D A Weibring. In the table, they are both listed with a score of 208 (row indexes 5 and 6).\n\n2. Next, we compare their scores with the other players in the table to determine their position. To do this, we look for the lowest score which is less than or equal to 208 (their score) and count the number of occurrences.\n\n3. We can see that Curtis Strange has a score of 206, which is lower than 208, so he finishes ahead of Larry Mize and D A Weibring.\n\n4. In the fifth place, there are three players tied with a score of 207: Nick Faldo, Bob Gilder, and Scott Simpson. Since the scores of Mize and Weibring are greater than 207, they do not tie for fifth place with these three players.\n\n5. We then compare their scores with the other tied players who finished ahead (in this case, none). If any of them had a score equal to or lower than 208, Mize and Weibring would be placed below those players and would not tie for fifth place. However, in this table, no such players exist.\n\n6. Therefore, Larry Mize and D A Weibring are tied for the position where there are no players with a lower score (i.e., sixth place or higher). They do not finish in the top five places, so they don't tie for fifth place.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the scores of Larry Mize and D A Weibring.\",\n    \"Compare their scores with other players to determine their position.\",\n    \"Check if there are any tied positions ahead of them.\",\n    \"Verify that no player with a lower score exists\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the table. It contains golf scores from a tournament for several players. The columns are `place`, `player`, `country`, `score` (total strokes), and `to par`. `To par` indicates the number of shots under or over par the player is at.\n2. To determine whether Fred Couples has a score larger than 210, we need to find his total score (`score` column) and compare it with the value 210.\n3. We can see that the row corresponding to Fred Couples (row 8 in the table) has a `player` of \"fred couples\" and a `score` of \"72 + 67 + 71 = 210\". This means that his total score is exactly 210.\n4. Since the player's total score is equal to 210, it does not meet the condition for having a score larger than 210.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand the table structure and purpose, find Fred Couples row, calculate his total score from the given formula, compare his total score with the required value\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}",
