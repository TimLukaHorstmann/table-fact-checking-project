Next, we consider hartford colonials with a home total of 57462. Again, this value is lower than the current highest value (91143).\n6. Then, we look at las vegas locomotives, whose home total is 40943. This value is also lower than the current highest value (91143).\n7. Lastly, we consider florida tuskers, but their home total of 37689 is even lower than all other values found so far.\n8.

So, the omaha nighthawks do not contribute to our answer.\n\n3. For the sacramento mountain lions, their home average is 18125 which is greater than 12796 and their road average is 16749 which is also greater than 12796. So, one team (sacramento mountain lions) contributes to the claim that there be more than 1 game that have an average of 12796.\n\n4.

For the las vegas locomotives, their home average is 13388 which is less than 12796 and their road average is also less than 12796 (16388). So, they do not contribute to our answer.\n\n6. For the florida tuskers, their home average is 14015 which is greater than 12796 but their road average is less than 12796 (12796).
