Identify the table provided in the question, which contains data about various seasons, managers, records, win percentages, post-season records, post-season win percentages, and MLB affiliates for each season.\n2. Find the row that corresponds to the year 2013 since we are checking if Kansas City had a post-season record in that year. In this table, the relevant row is the one with index 13 (since the first row represents the header).\n3. Check the 'post - season record' and 'post - season win %' columns for the row corresponding to 2013. Since both these columns are empty for that row, there was no post-season record for Kansas City in 2013.\n4. Compare this finding with the claim provided: \"Kansas city have no post - season record in 2013\"\n5.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, I identify the team for which we want to check post-season records - Houston.\n2. Next, I look through the table to find rows where the 'mlb affiliate' column is \"houston\". This will help me narrow down the list of managers and seasons to focus on.\n3. After that, I examine the 'post - season record' column for each row with an 'mlb affiliate' of \"houston\" to check if there are any non-empty values (indicating a post-season record).\n4. Finally, based on my findings, I determine whether Houston has a post-season record or not by checking if there is at least one non-empty value in the 'post - season record' column for rows with an 'mlb affiliate' of \"houston\".\n\nBased on the table provided, Houston does not have a post-season record because all entries in the 'post - season record' column for rows with an 'mlb affiliate' of \"houston\" are empty.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team (Houston)\", \"Check 'mlb affiliate' column for Houston\", \"Examine 'post - season record' column for Houston\", \"Determine if there is a post-season record by checking for non-empty values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\" }\n  ]\n}",
