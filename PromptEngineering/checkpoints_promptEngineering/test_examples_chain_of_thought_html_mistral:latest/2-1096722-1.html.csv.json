    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, identify the name of the episode we are interested in: part four.\n2. Next, look for the row where the episode name matches the one we identified. In this case, it is the fourth row.\n3. After identifying the correct row, check if the viewer count matches the claimed value of 10.6 million. In the specified row, the viewer count is indeed 10.6.\n4. Lastly, check if the run time matches the claimed value of 24:57. In the same row, the run time is given as 24:57.\n\nSince both conditions (viewer count and run time) match the claimed values, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's my final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify episode name\",\n    \"Find row with matching episode name\",\n    \"Check if viewer count matches claimed value\",\n    \"Check if run time matches claimed value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"run time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
