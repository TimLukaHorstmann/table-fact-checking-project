Next, I need to check how many of these finals ended with a score that has at least one side finishing with 6 points. By examining the 'score' column, we can see that in the 2000, 2002 (x2), and 2003 entries, Lleyton Hewitt won both matches with scores ending in 1, while in the 2004 and 2005 entries, he lost with scores ending in 6. Therefore, we have 3 out of 7 finals ending with a score that has at least one side finishing with 6 points (2000, 2002 x2).\n\n3. Finally, compare the number of matches found to the total number of master series finals Lleyton Hewitt participated in.
