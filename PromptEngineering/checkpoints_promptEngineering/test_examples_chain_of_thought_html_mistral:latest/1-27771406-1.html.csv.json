Identify the claim: The claim is that \"ivor mendonca have the most catches per test with an average of 4 catches per test\".\n\n2. Determine the relevant data for comparing the number of catches per test: We need to find out how many tests each player has played and the total number of catches they made during their test career.\n\n3. Compare the number of catches per test for each player: To do this, we will divide the total number of catches a player made by the number of tests they have played. This gives us an average number of catches per test for each player.\n\n4. Find ivor mendonca's row index and relevant columns in the table: We can find ivor mendonca's row index by looking at the \"no\" column, since his ID is 15. The relevant columns are \"catches\", \"tests\".\n\n5. Calculate ivor mendonca's average number of catches per test: To do this, we divide the total number of catches (8) by the number of tests (2). This gives us an average of 4 catches per test for ivor mendonca.\n\n6. Compare ivor mendonca's average number of catches per test with the other players: We will compare this value with the average number of catches per test calculated for each player in step 3.\n\n7.
