Identify the claim to verify, which is \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class\".\n3. Locate the row in the table that corresponds to the 'moto2' class. This row can be identified by its first column value (row_index=3).\n4. Verify if there is a 'pole' value in this row's fourth column (column name='pole').\n5. Compare the obtained value with the claim. If the value matches the claim, then the answer is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, here's my final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the table and claim\", \"Locate the relevant row in the table\", \"Check the 'pole' value for the moto2 class\", \"Compare the obtained value with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"4 pole have a moto2 class\".\n2. Understand the table structure: The table provides data about different classes (125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2) for various seasons, races, podiums, and poles.\n3. Look for rows corresponding to the \"moto2\" class: The row with index 3 in the table corresponds to the \"moto2\" class.\n4. Determine if there are 4 pole positions for moto2: In the row corresponding to the \"moto2\" class, there is a value of 0 in the \"pole\" column. This means no pole positions were recorded for the moto2 class.\n5. Compare the claim with the findings: The claim states that \"4 pole have a moto2 class\". However, after examining the table, it was found that there are no pole positions recorded for the moto2 class. Since the claim is contradictory to the findings, it can be considered FALSE.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Look for rows corresponding to the 'moto2' class\",\n    \"Determine if there are 4 pole positions for moto2\",\n    \"Compare the claim with the findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"pole\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
