Search through the table for rows that match the given date and type of competition. In this case, row number 17 matches these criteria as it is a friendly match on 26 May 1999.\n3. Identify the venue for this match by examining the 'City' column of the matching row. In this case, the city is 'lugo'.\n4. Check if the venue is in Emilia-Romagna region. Since there is no column that explicitly specifies the region, it's impossible to confirm whether Lugo (a city in Spain) belongs to Emilia-Romagna (an Italian region).\n5. Examine the result by looking at the 'Result' column of the matching row. In this case, the result is 1 - 4 which does not match the claimed result of 2 - 4.\n\nThe JSON output would be as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify date and competition type from claim\",\n    \"Search for matching rows in table\",\n    \"Determine venue from City column\",\n    \"Check if the venue belongs to Emilia-Romagna region (information unavailable)\",\n    \"Compare the result with claimed result\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"City\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
