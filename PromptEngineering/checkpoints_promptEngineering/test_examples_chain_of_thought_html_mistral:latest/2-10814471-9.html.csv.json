    "resp": "Here is the reasoning process:\n1. Identify the player for whom the claim is made, which is Tevita Vaikona.\n2. Check the position of the player to ensure it matches with a position where points can be earned directly (fullback, wing, stand off, or centre). Since Tevita's position is 'wing', points can be earned through tries and conversions.\n3. Check the number of tries made by Tevita Vaikona. In the table, he has made 25 tries.\n4. Check the number of points scored by Tevita Vaikona. In the table, he has scored 100 points.\n5. Compare the total number of points with the product of the number of tries and the number of points per try (assuming each try is worth 4 points for simplicity). In this case, the calculation would be: (25 * 4) = 100. Since Tevita's total score matches the calculated value, it is reasonable to suspect that the claim might be true.\n6. To confirm the claim, we need to find any other way in which points can be earned that has not been accounted for in our calculation (drop goals, penalties, etc.). In this table, there are no additional ways of earning points mentioned, so we can assume that points earned through tries and conversions alone will suffice.\n7. Check the consistency of the data presented to ensure it is accurate and reliable. Since the data provided in the table is consistent with our calculations, it can be assumed to be accurate.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player, check position, count tries, count points, compare points to calculated value, verify other ways of earning points, ensure data consistency\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n}",
