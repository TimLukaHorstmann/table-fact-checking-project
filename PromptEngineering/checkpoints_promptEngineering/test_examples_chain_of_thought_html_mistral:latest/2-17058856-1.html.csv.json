Each row represents an event (goal scored) during a game, with columns for period, team, scorer, time, and score.\n\n2. The claim is about the score when Vladimir Malenkikh makes a goal at 18:27. To find this, we need to look for the row where \"vladimir malenkikh\" is in the \"goal\" column and the time matches \"18:27\".\n\n3. In the table, the row with \"vladimir malenkikh (1) ( pp )\" under the \"goal\" column, and \"18:27\" under the \"time\" column corresponds to the event in question.\n\n4. The score at that time can be found in the \"score\" column of the same row, which is \"0 - 2 met\".\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in a valid JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the structure of the table (period, team, goal, time, score)\",\n    \"Find the row where 'vladimir malenkikh' is in the 'goal' column and the time matches '18:27'\",\n    \"Check the 'score' column for the found row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the key information needed to verify the claim: the period, team, and time when a goal was scored for the \"met\" team and the score at that moment should be 0 - 2 for met.\n\n2. Scan the table to find a row where the 'team' column has the value 'met' and the 'time' column has a value close to 18:27 (since goal times are approximations). This will help us find the row corresponding to the goal scored by Vladimir Malenkikh.\n\n3. Verify that the period in this row matches with the first period since the goal scored at 18:27 belongs to the first period.\n\n4. Check if the score in this row is 0 - 2 for met. The score in the row should be '0 - 2 met' since the scores are listed as goal difference and it shows that met has 2 goals against them at that moment.\n\nThe relevant cells would be:\n[{ \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"period\" }, { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\" }, { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\" }, { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" }]\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
