    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim's components: The claim states that \"hydraulics, driven by Damon Hill, have a grid number bigger than 1.\" To verify this, we need to find if Damon Hill's car had hydraulic issues and check his grid number.\n2. Search for Damon Hill's row in the table: Scan the \"driver\" column for any row containing the text \"damon hill\".\n3. Check the cause of retirement or grid position: If the row is found, verify if the value under the \"time / retired\" column indicates a hydraulic problem, and if there's a value listed in the \"grid\" column.\n4. Compare the grid number with 1: If both conditions (hydraulic issue and grid number) are met, compare the grid number with 1 to determine if it is bigger than 1.\n\nAfter following these steps, here's my output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the components of the claim (driver, cause of retirement/grid position)\",\n    \"Search for Damon Hill's row\",\n    \"Check the cause of retirement or grid position\",\n    \"Compare the grid number with 1\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 57,\n      \"column_name\": \"driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 57,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 57,\n      \"column_name\": \"grid\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
