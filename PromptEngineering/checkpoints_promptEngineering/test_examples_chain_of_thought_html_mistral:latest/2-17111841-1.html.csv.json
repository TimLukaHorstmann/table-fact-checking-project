    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the data we need from the table to evaluate the claim. Specifically, we need to find out if there exists any row with episode number 4 and original airdate 8 june 2008.\n\n2. Iterate through each row in the table (from bottom to top due to the order of rows) and check if the values for \"episode\" and \"original airdate\" match the required values (i.e., 4 and 8 june 2008 respectively).\n\n3. If we find such a row, then the claim is TRUE, as there exists an episode on June 8, 2008 with episode number 4. Otherwise, if no matching row is found, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's present the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check each row in the table to see if the 'episode' and 'original airdate' match the required values\",\n    \"Iterate from bottom to top because of the order of rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row in the table that corresponds to the episode with an original airdate of 8 June 2008. In the given table, this would be the fourth row as it has the date \"8 june 2008\".\n\n2. Check the 'viewers (millions)' column for the identified row. This cell has a value of \"1.364\" millions.\n\n3. Compare the viewer count with all other episodes in the table to find the least watched episode. In this case, the episode with 1.364 million viewers is not the least watched as there are episodes with lower viewer counts (1.324, 1.349, and 1.432).\n\n4. Based on the comparison, we find that the statement \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 june 2008 be 4\" is FALSE as there are episodes with lower viewer counts than the identified one (episode number 4).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row corresponding to the given date.
