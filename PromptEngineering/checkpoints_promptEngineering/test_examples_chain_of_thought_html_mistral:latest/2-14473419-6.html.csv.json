    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to the game number 48, which has a `td` tag with an id of \"48\".\n2. From the table headers, determine that the 'game', 'march', and 'record' columns are relevant for checking the claim. The 'score' and 'opponent' columns are not directly relevant to the given claim.\n3. Check the value in the 'march' column of row 48 (since the claim states it should be March 2, but the table provides dates as game numbers). There is no direct March date provided in the table, so we need to consider other possible ways to interpret the data. One way is to assume that the games are listed chronologically by their date within a month, not necessarily starting on the 1st. In this case, since there are 31 days in March, game number 48 would occur around March 26th if we are assuming a single game per day. However, the table doesn't specify that assumption, so it is unclear if March 2 (specifically) applies to any particular row based on the provided data alone.\n4. Given the lack of clarity in the table about the specific date each game occurred within March, and since the claim asks for a match between \"48th game\" and \"March 2\", it is impossible to definitively verify the truthfulness of this claim with the information provided.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify row corresponding to game 48, determine relevant columns for checking the claim, check the value in the 'march' column of row 48 (assuming games are chronologically ordered within March), and consider if 'March 2' applies to any particular row based on the table data alone.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"march\"}]\n}",
