Verify the presence of cumann na ngaedheal government in the table: The table provides information about different elections, their respective D\u00e1il (parliament), share of votes, seats, and government. The government column shows that cumann na ngaedheal was in power for three elections: 1923, 1927 (Jun), and 1927 (Sep).\n\n3. Look for the row containing cumann na ngaedheal government: To check if the cumann na ngaedheal government received a 27% share of votes and had 46 seats, we need to find the row corresponding to this specific government in the table. Based on our examination, the only election where cumann na ngaedheal government was in power and had 46 seats is the one that occurred in 1927 (Jun).\n\n4. Compare the share of votes and seats for cumann na ngaedheal government: In the row corresponding to the 1927 (Jun) election, we can see that the share of votes was 27.0% and the number of seats was 46. This matches the claim.\n\n5. Final Verification: To confirm our answer, we look for other elections where cumann na ngaedheal government had 46 seats.
