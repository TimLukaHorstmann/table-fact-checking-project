    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. First, I need to identify the row where Chip Beck's data is located in the table. From the table, we can see that Chip Beck's name appears in the second row.\n2. Next, I compare Chip Beck's score with the score given in the 'score' column of the second row. The score for Chip Beck is 281. In the second row, the value under the 'score' column is also 281. This means that Chip Beck's score matches the provided score.\n3. Now, I need to find if there is any discrepancy in the 'money' column for Chip Beck. The money given for Chip Beck is 47646. In the second row, the value under the 'money' column is indeed 47646. This means that the money given for Chip Beck matches the provided money.\n\nIn summary:\n1. Compare score of Chip Beck with the 'score' column in the table.\n2. Compare money of Chip Beck with the 'money' column in the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row containing Chip Beck's data\",\n    \"Compare score of Chip Beck with the 'score' column for this row\",\n    \"Compare money of Chip Beck with the 'money' column for this row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"money\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to validate the claim:\n\n1. Identify the player whose place is given as t6. In the table, we can see that players Ben Crenshaw and Payne Stewart share the 6th place.\n\n2. Check if the country of the identified player is the United States. In the table, we can see that both Ben Crenshaw and Payne Stewart are from the United States as their 'country' column value is \"united states\".\n\n3. Since the conditions in steps 1 and 2 are met for both Ben Crenshaw and Payne Stewart, we compare their scores to determine which one is specifically mentioned in the claim. In the table, we can see that the score for Ben Crenshaw (76+69+69+69=283) matches with what's given in the claim (283).\n\nNow let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player whose place is t6, check if the country is United States, compare the scores to determine which one is specifically mentioned in the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the given claim: The claim states that Ben Crenshaw, who comes in 8th place, is from West Germany.\n2. Identify the relevant columns in the table: Since the claim involves the place, player, and country, we'll focus on the \"place\", \"player\", and \"country\" columns.\n3. Find Ben Crenshaw's row in the table: We search for a row where the \"player\" column is equal to \"Ben Crenshaw\". The relevant row number is 6.\n4. Check the country of Ben Crenshaw: In the \"country\" column of the found row, we see that Ben Crenshaw's country is the United States, not West Germany.\n5. Compare the given claim with our findings: Based on our findings from step 4, the given claim is FALSE because Ben Crenshaw, who comes in 8th place, is indeed an American, not a German.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the given claim\",\n    \"Identify relevant columns\",\n    \"Find Ben Crenshaw's row in the table\",\n    \"Check the country of Ben Crenshaw\",\n    \"Compare the given claim with our findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\" }\n  ]\n}",
