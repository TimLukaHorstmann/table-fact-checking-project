    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the table's structure. The table lists different teams along with their points scored (points), games played (played), drawn games (drawn), lost games (lost), games against other teams (against), and goal difference (difference).\n\n2. Next, we focus on the two specific teams mentioned in the claim: Corinthians and S\u00edrio. We find their rows in the table based on their team names. Row 1 corresponds to Corinthians and row 3 to S\u00edrio.\n\n3. We then compare the \"lost\" column values for both teams to determine how many games each team lost. For Corinthians, it is 2, while for S\u00edrio, it is 3.\n\n4. To check if S\u00edrio won more games than Corinthians lost, we need to ensure that the number of wins by S\u00edrio (not mentioned in the table) is greater than the number of losses by Corinthians. Since teams earn points for winning, and we know the total points earned by a team, we can indirectly determine how many games they won.\n\n5. Let's calculate the number of wins for both teams:\n   - Corinthians have 30 points from 18 games (excluding draws), so their win ratio is 30/18 = 1.67 (approximately). Since you cannot have a fraction of a game, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Corinthians won approximately 16 games.\n   - S\u00edrio have 26 points from 18 games (excluding draws), so their win ratio is 26/18 = 1.44 (approximately). Again, rounding down, S\u00edrio would have won approximately 14 games.\n\n6. Now, let's compare the number of wins for both teams: 16 (Corinthians) vs 14 (S\u00edrio).\n\n7. Since the number of wins by S\u00edrio is less than the number of losses by Corinthians, the claim \"s\u00edrio win more games than corinthian lost\" is FALSE.\n\n   Here's my output in the requested JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand table structure, locate Corinthians and S\u00edrio rows, compare 'lost' column values, calculate number of wins for both teams, compare win counts\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n     ]\n   }",
