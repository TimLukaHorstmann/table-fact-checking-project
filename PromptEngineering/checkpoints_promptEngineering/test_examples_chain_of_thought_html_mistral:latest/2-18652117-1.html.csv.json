Scan through the table to find a row where the 'player' column matches the target name \"tony lorick\".\n3. In this table, the row with index 7 has the player's name \"tony lorick\".\n4. Check the 'position' column in the same row (row index 7) to determine if it matches the position of a running back (rb).\n5. The value in the 'position' column for row index 7 is indeed \"rb\", confirming that Tony Lorick is a running back.\n6. Lastly, check the 'team' column in the same row to verify if he plays for Oakland.\n7. The value in the 'team' column for row index 7 is \"oakland\", confirming that Tony Lorick does play for Oakland.\n\nSince all the steps confirmed that Tony Lorick is a running back for Oakland, the claim is TRUE.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find 'tony lorick' in the table, Check if position matches 'rb', Check if team matches 'oakland'\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}",

This indicates that \"tony lorick\" was not picked by any of the other teams (boston, kansas city, new york, denver, buffalo, houston).\n3.

The claim states that \"tony lorick\" should be pick number 7 by denver. Since \"tony lorick\" was picked at all (only by Oakland), the condition about being pick number 7 does not apply to this case.
