To compare if more services have no HDTV than those that do, we would need a comparison between the number of services with and without HDTV. Since there are only HDTV services in this table, it follows that no services have no HDTV according to this data.\n5. If there were any other data sources or additional context that included services without HDTV, then we could compare the two groups and make an accurate determination.
