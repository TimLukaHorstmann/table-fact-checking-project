Determine the minimum number of episodes for a series from the table: Scan through the rows in the \"no in season\" column. This column shows the episode numbers for each series. The smallest value we find will be the minimum number of episodes for a series, which is 11 (row with index 0).\n\n3. Compare the minimum number of episodes found to all other series: Since the minimum value from step 2 (11) is equal to or greater than every other value in the \"no in season\" column, it means that at least one series has 11 episodes and no series has fewer episodes.\n\n4. Conclude whether the claim is true or false based on the comparison made: Since the minimum number of episodes (11) matches with a listed series, the claim is indeed true.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in season\" }\n]\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
