    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I identify the events in the table, which are the Egyptian Premier League (EPL), the Egyptian Cup, and the CAF Champions League. The 'total' column represents the sum of points earned in these three events.\n2. Next, I look for players who have scored more than 1 point in any of the three events. To do this, I count the number of rows where the total column is greater than 1.\n3. In the table provided, only two players (gamal hamza and junior agogo) meet this condition because they both have a total score of 3 or more points.\n4. Since no other player has a total score greater than 1, I conclude that gamal hamza and junior agogo are the only players to score in more than one event.\n\nNow, my final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the events by looking at the column headers.\",\n    \"Count the number of rows where the 'total' column is greater than 1.\",\n    \"Check if there are any other players with a total score > 1.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
