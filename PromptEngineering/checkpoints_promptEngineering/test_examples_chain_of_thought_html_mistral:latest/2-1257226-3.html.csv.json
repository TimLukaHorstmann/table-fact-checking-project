The date for Guillermo Franco playing on October 8, 2005, can be found in row 1, and the date for March 1, 2006, can be found in row 2.\n2. Check the \"score\" column within those rows to compare the goal scores for each match. In row 1, the score is 1 (since it shows as 1-1 but we are looking at Guillermo Franco's goal), and in row 2, the score is also 1.\n3. Since both dates have the same score value of 1, we need to check if there is any other information that could help us determine which match had a lower goal for Guillermo Franco. However, since all other columns (date, venue, result, competition) do not contain any individual player's statistics or goals, we cannot use this information to differentiate between the two matches.\n4. Therefore, we don't have enough information to definitively say that Guillermo Franco had a lower goal on March 1, 2006, than October 8, 2005.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare the dates mentioned in the claim with the table.\",\n    \"Find corresponding rows based on the dates.\",\n    \"Check the 'score' column for goal differences between matches.\",\n    \"Examine other columns to see if they contain any player statistics or goals.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",

Since the claim is about March 1, 2006, we focus on row 2 for now. We need to find another date where Franco played again and compare their scores.\n\n4. Scroll through the table again. We see a matching goal number in row 6 (September 5, 2009). This is our candidate date for comparison with March 1, 2006.\n\n5. Now, let's check if there are any other dates with Franco's number before or after the two candidate dates (March 1, 2006 and September 5, 2009). We don't find any such matches.\n\n6. Compare the scores for March 1, 2006 (row 2: 1 - 0) and September 5, 2009 (row 6: 0 - 2).
