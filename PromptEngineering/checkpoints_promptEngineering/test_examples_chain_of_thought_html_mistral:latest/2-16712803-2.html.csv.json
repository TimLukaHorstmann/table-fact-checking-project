We can split these strings at the space character to extract the winning score and the opponent's score.\n\n2. Next, we need to compare the scores across all games to find the game with the highest score. In the given table, we see that the score for the game in week 1 was \"47 - 27\". To compare this score with others, we will convert the scores into a single number by subtracting the opponent's score from the winning team's score. In this case, the score becomes 47 - 27 = 19 (higher means better).\n\n3. Now, we need to check if there is any game with a higher score than this game.
