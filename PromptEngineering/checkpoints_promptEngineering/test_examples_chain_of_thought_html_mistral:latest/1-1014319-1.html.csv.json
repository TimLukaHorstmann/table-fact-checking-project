Since Goodman's score is in the column named 'goodman', we search for the row containing the dance 'tango'. The score for Goodman is found in the cell with row_index=9 and column_name='goodman'.\n3. Check if the score given by Goodman is 10. In this case, the value in the cell is 9, which does not match the claim of receiving a 10 from Goodman.\n4. Find Tonioli's scores for this dance. Since Tonioli's score is in the column named 'tonioli', we search for the row containing the dance 'tango'. The score for Tonioli is found in the cell with row_index=9 and column_name='tonioli'.\n5. Check if Tonioli rated this dance. If the value in the cell is not an empty string or 'n/a', it means that Tonioli did rate this dance.
