    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Check the dates of all the rows in the table to see if there's a game after May 10th.\n2. Iterate through the rows starting from the first row (index 0) and check the 'date' column for dates later than May 10th.\n3. Once we find a date later than May 10th, check the corresponding 'location / attendance' column to see if it is \"montreal forum\".\n4. If the location is indeed \"montreal forum\", check the 'score' column for a score of \"5 - 4 (ot)\".\n\n   The relevant cells are:\n   [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": <some row index that satisfies the condition>,\n       \"column_name\": \"date\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": <same row index>,\n       \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": <same row index>,\n       \"column_name\": \"score\"\n     }\n   ]\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Check if there's a game after May 10th\",\n       \"Iterate through the rows and check the 'date' column\",\n       \"If we find a date later than May 10th, check the corresponding 'location / attendance' column for 'montreal forum'\",\n       \"If the location is indeed 'montreal forum', check the 'score' column for '5 - 4 (ot)'\",\n       \"Relevant cells are the date, location/attendance, and score of a game that satisfies these conditions\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": <boolean value based on whether we find such a row>,\n     \"relevant_cells\": []\n   }",
