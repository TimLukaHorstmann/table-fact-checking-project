In the table, the column name is \"None\", which indicates that there are no headers or labels for the columns. Therefore, we cannot directly identify an album as being Maroon 5's. However, we can infer that the first row represents the highest position on the chart (1) since it has the least number (1).\n4. To find out if any of the subsequent rows represent Maroon 5, we would need to know which album is associated with them and confirm if they are indeed a Maroon 5 album.
