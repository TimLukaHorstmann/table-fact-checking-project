In our table, this corresponds to the second row (row_index=1).\n2. Check the opponent column for this row. The value in this cell should match the opponent given in the claim, which is \"denver broncos\". In our table, this condition is satisfied because it shows \"denver broncos\" for the second row.\n3. Check the final score column for this row. The value in this cell should match the final score given in the claim, which is \"w 13 - 24\", where \"w\" stands for a win and \"-\" indicates a loss. In our table, the value for this cell is \"w 34 - 13\". To interpret this value, we can assume that a win is represented by a positive number (score for our team), a loss is represented by a negative number (score against our team), and the opponent's score is shown first. Since our team won in our table with a score of 34 and the opponent scored 13, this condition is not satisfied because the final score shown is not \"w 13 - 24\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to September 26\",\n    \"Check the opponent column for this row\",\n    \"Check the final score column for this row and interpret its value correctly\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"final score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
