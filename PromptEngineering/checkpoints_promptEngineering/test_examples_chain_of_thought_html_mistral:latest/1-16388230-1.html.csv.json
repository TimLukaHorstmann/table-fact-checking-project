Compare the date and time for that row with every other row to ensure there are no conflicting matches at different venues: The match between Port Adelaide and Fremantle took place on Friday, 28 February 1997, at Football Park (as indicated by the \"ground\" column). There are no other matches listed in the table that have a date and time matching this one.\n4. Verify that the stadium mentioned for Port Adelaide's match is indeed Bruce Stadium: To verify this, we look at the \"ground\" column of the 6th row, which states \"football park.\" However, since there was no other match with a date and time matching this one, it means that the confusion about the stadium name arises from comparing the claimed stadium (Bruce Stadium) with the incorrectly interpreted ground for Port Adelaide's match.\n5. Cross-reference the stadium names to ensure that Bruce Stadium is actually associated with a home team score of 9.10 (64): We look through the table and find that the only match taking place at Bruce Stadium (row index 7) has an away team score of 9.10 (68), which does not match the claimed away team score of 9.10 (64).\n6. Look for another match in the table where the home team score is 9.10 (64) and confirm that it takes place at Football Park: We look through the table again and find that the only match with a home team score of 9.10 (66) takes place at Waverley Park.\n7. Verify that there are no conflicting matches taking place simultaneously at different venues: No other matches in the table have a date, time, or venue matching this one.\n8. Check if the match with a home team score of 9.10 (66) at Waverley Park has an away team score that corresponds to the claimed value of 4.15 (39): The match in question is the one between Hawthorn and Richmond (row index 2), where the away team score is indeed 11.12 (78).\n9.

Reassess the table and look for another match where the home team score is 4.15 (39): We look through the table again and find that there is no match with a home team score of exactly 4.15 (39). However, we notice that there is a match between Port Adelaide and Fremantle (row index 6) where the home team score is 4.15 if we consider the total points by multiplying goals by 4 and adding behinds.
