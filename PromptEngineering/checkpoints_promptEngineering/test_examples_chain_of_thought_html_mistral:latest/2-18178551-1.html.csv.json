However, since England is playing their opponents in away matches, we can infer that they are listed under the 'against' column as a positive score (since goals/points are typically listed as a positive number).\n2. Check if all of England's away matches in 2000 are at Murrayfield, Edinburgh. To do this, we need to go through each row and check the opponent, date, and venue for each match where the status is not \"six nations\" (as Six Nations matches don't qualify as away games for England).\n3. First, we find a row with 'scotland' in the opposing teams column and the date of '02 / 04 / 2000', which appears to be an away match according to the provided table. However, the venue is Murrayfield, Edinburgh, which contradicts our claim as it is their home ground for England.\n4. Moving on to the next matches, we find three more rows with 'south africa' (17/06/2000, 24/06/2000) and 'australia' (18/11/2000), all of which are at venues other than Murrayfield.\n5. Lastly, we find a row with 'argentina' on 25/11/2000, but again, it's at Twickenham, London, not Murrayfield.\n6.
