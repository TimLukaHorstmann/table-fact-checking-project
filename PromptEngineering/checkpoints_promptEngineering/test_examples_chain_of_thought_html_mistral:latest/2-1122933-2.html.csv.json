If all the listed drivers participated in the race, then the claim that there were a total of 17 drivers would be incorrect because we have already accounted for more than 17 drivers. Therefore, to validate the claim, we should check if any driver has been missed or counted multiple times.\n\n3. To verify this, we can look for any repeated entries in the table. If we find a driver listed more than once, it would indicate that they were double-counted and could potentially support the claim that there were fewer than 28 drivers in total. However, upon examination of the table, no driver appears to be listed more than once.\n\n4.
