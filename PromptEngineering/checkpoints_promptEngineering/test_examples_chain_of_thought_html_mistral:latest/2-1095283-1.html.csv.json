Identify the claim: The claim states that \"cyanogen bromide have a field stability of 5 and effectiveness as a blood agent of 9\".\n\n3. Find the row in the table corresponding to the agent mentioned in the claim: The agent mentioned in the claim is \"cyanogen bromide\", which can be found in the first column of the second-to-last row.\n\n4. Check the field stability value for cyanogen bromide: Looking at the \"field stability\" column for the row identified, we see that it has a value of 8 (row_index=6, column_name=\"field stability\").\n\n5. Check the effectiveness as a blood agent value for cyanogen bromide: Looking at the \"effectiveness as a blood agent\" column for the row identified, we see that it has a value of 9 (row_index=6, column_name=\"effectiveness as a blood agent\").\n\n6. Compare the claim values with the table values: The claim states that cyanogen bromide should have field stability of 5 and effectiveness as a blood agent of 9. However, the table shows that the field stability value for cyanogen bromide is 8 and its effectiveness as a blood agent is also 9.\n\n7.
