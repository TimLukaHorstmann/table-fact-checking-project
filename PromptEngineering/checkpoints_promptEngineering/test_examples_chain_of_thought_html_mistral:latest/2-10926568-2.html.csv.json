Identify the column names to determine the required information from the table: Production No, Episode No, Original Airdate, and Episode Title.\n2. Identify the claim: \"episode number 213 air on january 28 , 2008\". This claim requires checking if there is a row where both the episode number (Episode No) is 213 and the original airdate (Original Airdate) is January 28, 2008.\n3. Iterate through each row in the table:\n   - For the first row (index=0), the episode number (Episode No) is not 213.\n   - For the second row (index=1), the episode number (Episode No) is not 213.\n   - ... and so on until we reach the last row (index=26).\n4. In the last row (index=26), we find that the episode number (Episode No) is 213, but the original airdate (Original Airdate) is not January 28, 2008.\n5. Since we have found a row where neither of the required conditions match, it means there is no episode with number 213 that aired on January 28, 2008.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names for required information\", \"Check if claim conditions (episode number and original airdate) match for any row in table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Episode No\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Episode No\" },\n    ...\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Episode No\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Original Airdate\" }\n  ]\n}",
