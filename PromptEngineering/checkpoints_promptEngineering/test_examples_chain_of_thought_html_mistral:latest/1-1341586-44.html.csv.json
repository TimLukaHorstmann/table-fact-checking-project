Next, locate the relevant data in the table which lists all the representatives for each district.\n3. Search for any rows where the 'Representative' column matches 'mac sweeney'. Since there is only one row meeting this condition, we have identified the potential district(s).\n4. Inspect the districts listed under the 'District' column for the matched representative (mac sweeney) to find out if Texas 14 is the only district mentioned.\n5. Observation: The row matching mac sweeney lists 'Texas 17' in the District column, indicating that Texas 14 was not the only district listed for mac sweeney.\n6.
