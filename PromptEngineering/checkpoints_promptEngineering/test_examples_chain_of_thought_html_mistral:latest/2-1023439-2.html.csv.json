    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim, which states that during 1986, the value for `us dance` should be 6 when the value of `us r&b` is 9.\n2. Scan the table to find rows where the year equals 1986 (there are two such rows).\n3. Check if there's any row where both the `us dance` and `us r&b` values exist and match the specified conditions.\n4. In the first row with year 1986, the value for `us dance` is 6, but the value for `us r&b` is not equal to 9 (it's actually 9).\n5. In the second row with year 1986, the value for `us dance` is missing (-), and the value for `us r&b` is also not equal to 9 (it's actually 0).\n6. Since there's no row where both `us dance` and `us r&b` meet the specified conditions, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Scan the table for rows with year=1986\", \"Check if there's a row where both `us dance` and `us r&b` values meet the conditions\", \"Analyze each row with year=1986 to find matching conditions\", \"Determine that no such row exists, so the claim is FALSE\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us dance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\" }\n  ]\n}",
