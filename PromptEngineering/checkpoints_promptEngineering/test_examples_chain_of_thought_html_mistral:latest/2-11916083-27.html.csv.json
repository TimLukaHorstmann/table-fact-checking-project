The table contains 10 rows (for each unique theme in 2008 and 2009) and for each row, there are 5 columns, so we expect to find 50 cells (or rows * columns).

There are 12 such entries (for each team) from the year 2008, as the table shows.\n4. Identify the unique coins from the coin and puck set: In order to have a half of a coin, we need to find at least two different coins from the same set for one team. Since there are multiple entries per team in the coin and puck set, it is possible that each entry represents a unique coin. However, without more information about the specifics of the coin and puck set (for example, if one set contains 2 identical coins), we cannot definitively say whether each entry represents a unique coin or not.\n5. Check for multiple entries from the same team: To see if there are any teams with more than one entry in the coin and puck set, we look through the table.
