    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the player of interest - Viswanathan Anand.\n2. Find his row in the table by looking for the player name \"viswanathan anand\". His row index is 0 (indexing starts from 0).\n3. Extract the values corresponding to the relevant columns: rank, prev, rating, and change. For Viswanathan Anand, these are 1, 2, 2803, and +4 respectively.\n4. Compare the extracted values with the given conditions in the claim. The condition \"rating greater than 2753\" is true for Viswanathan Anand (2803 > 2753). The condition \"prev less than 4\" is also true for Viswanathan Anand (2 < 4). The condition \"+ 4 as the chng\" is exactly matched with the extracted value.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player of interest, find row in table, extract relevant values, compare with given conditions\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rating\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prev\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"change\"}]\n}",
