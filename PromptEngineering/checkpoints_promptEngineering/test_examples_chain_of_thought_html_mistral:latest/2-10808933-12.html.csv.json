The teams playing are: st kilda, fitzroy, north melbourne, hawthorn, richmond, geelong and footscray.\n2. Next, we check each team in the 'home team' column to see if they were listed as playing at home on 6th July 1968. Only st kilda, fitzroy, north melbourne, hawthorn, and richmond are listed as home teams on that date.\n3. Since we are looking for footscray, we check the 'away team' column to see if they appear anywhere in the table.\n4. We find footscray as the away team in the third row of the table, playing against north melbourne.\n5.
