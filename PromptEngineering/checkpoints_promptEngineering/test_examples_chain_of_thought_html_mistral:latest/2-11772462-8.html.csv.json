These columns are 'date', 'visitor', and 'team playing at home' (indicated by the 'home' column).\n\n2. Next, I looked for a row where the 'visitor' team was Washington. This happens on multiple rows in the table, so I don't need to worry about finding a specific match here.\n\n3. Since the claim mentions that the visiting team is playing in Tampa Bay, I compared the 'home' teams for each row where Washington is the visitor. The 'home' column lists the team playing at home for each game.\n\n4. If the 'home' team for a Washington-visitor match was Tampa Bay, then the claim would be true. After checking all rows with Washington as the visitor, I found that there is indeed one such row: Row 13 where the date is March 25 and the home team is Carolina. In this game, Washington visited Tampa Bay.\n\n5. Finally, I verified that Washington was the visiting team by checking if the 'visitor' for this specific row (Row 13) was indeed Tampa Bay. The 'visitor' column in Row 13 does contain \"tampa bay\", confirming my previous observation.\n\nHere is the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns: visitor, home\\nFind rows where visitor is Washington\\nCheck if home team for any of these games is Tampa Bay\\nConfirm that visitor for the matching row is actually Tampa Bay\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home\" }\n  ]\n}",

In our table, each row corresponds to a different day. Each row has the \"date\" as its first column, so we will compare the values in this column.\n3. Compare the team mentioned in the claim (washington) with the \"home\" or \"visitor\" columns for the matched row. If the value in the row that matches March 27 is \"washington\", it means Washington was a visitor that day. If the value is the opposite of what we expect, then Washington was at home that day.\n4. If Washington is indeed a visitor on March 27, then the claim is TRUE. If Washington is not a visitor on March 27, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's find out whether the claim is true:\n\n1. Scroll through the table until we find the row that matches March 27. The matching row is at index 19.\n2. In this row, the \"home\" value is \"tampa bay\", and the \"date\" value is \"march 27\".

The \"record\" column in that row shows the record for Boston after March 3, which is 31 - 28 - 8.\n4.
