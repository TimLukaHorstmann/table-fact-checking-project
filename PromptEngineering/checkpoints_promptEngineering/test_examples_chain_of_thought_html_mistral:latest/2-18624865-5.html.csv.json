Compare the lanes of Michael Rock and Loan Gherghel to determine if they are next to each other.\n    - In swimming competitions, swimmers are usually placed such that lane 1 and lane 8 are next to each other (at opposite ends of the pool), while lane 2 and lane 7 are also next to each other (on either side of the starting blocks).
