Find the game 1 row in the table: Since each row represents a game, we need to find the first row which corresponds to game 1. We can do this by looking at the \"game\" column and finding the row with the value \"1\".\n\n3. Check the attendance of game 1: In the found row (row 1), check the cell under the \"attendance\" column. The attendance of game 1 should be in this cell.\n\n4. Compare the claim with the attendance of game 1: Compare the value in the \"attendance\" cell of row 1 with the number given in the claim, i.e., compare \"30511\" with the value found in step 3.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim (attendance of game 1 is 30511), find game 1 row (row index 1), check attendance of game 1 (cell under 'attendance' column in row 1), compare claim with game 1's attendance\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Verify the time of game 8: Inspect the table again to find the row that corresponds to game 8 on October 9. The time for this game, as per the table, is 2:27.\n\n4. Compare the claim and the table: Based on steps 2 and 3, the location and time of game 8 as given in the table match with what's stated in the claim.\n\n5.
