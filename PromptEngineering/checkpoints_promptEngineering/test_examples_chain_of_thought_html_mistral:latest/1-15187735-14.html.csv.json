Locate the row in the table that corresponds to Netflix series 07e05: In this case, it's the fifth row, with episode number 174 and title s07e05.\n3. Identify the column in the table that corresponds to segment c for each episode: This is the fourth column, labeled \"segment c\".\n4. Check if the value in the identified cell matches the given claim: The value in the segment c cell for row 5 (episode 174) is concrete roofing tile, not a sandwich cookie.\n\nWith this analysis, here's the final answer as JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Locate the corresponding row and column in the table\", \"Check if the value in the identified cell matches the given claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"segment c\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
