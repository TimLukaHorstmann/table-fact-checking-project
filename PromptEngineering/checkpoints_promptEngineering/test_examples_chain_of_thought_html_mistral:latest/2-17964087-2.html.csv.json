Since we are looking for those who were appointed when they were in their 30s, we will consider 29 to 39 as the range.\n4. Check the age column (column_name: \"age at appointment\") for each row and compare it with the given range.\n5. If a politician's age is within the range (29-39), add that row to a list.\n6. After iterating through all rows, count the number of rows in the list. This will give us the number of politicians who were appointed when they were in their 30s.\n7.
