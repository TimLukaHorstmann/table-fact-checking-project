    "resp": "1. First, we need to identify the information needed to answer the claim: the number of games played by Ipatinga (38), the number of games they have lost, and the number of games they have drawn.\n\n2. We then look up the relevant data in the table. For Ipatinga, we can see that they have played 38 games (as specified in the claim), and they have lost 21 games (by looking at the \"Total Victories\" column and subtracting it from the total number of games) and drawn 8 games (as specified in the claim).\n\n3. To check if they have lost more than 14 games, we compare the number of losses with 14: 21 > 14 => TRUE\n\n4. Therefore, our answer is that Ipatinga indeed have lost more than 14 games out of 38 games played (as per the claim), so the statement is correct.\n\nFinal JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the needed information from the question: number of games, losses, and draws for Ipatinga.\\n\",\n                       \"Look up relevant data in the table (38 games played by Ipatinga, 21 losses, and 8 draws).\\n\",\n                       \"Compare the number of losses with 14 to check if they have lost more than 14 games.\\n\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": \"20\", \"column_name\": \"Total Games Played\"}, {\"row_index\": \"20\", \"column_name\": \"Total Defeats\"}, {\"row_index\": \"20\", \"column_name\": \"Draws\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "1. First, we need to check the total points scored by the team Ipatinga. From the table, we can see that the number of points scored by each team is located in the column labeled \"Total Points\". The row index for Ipatinga is 20. So, the relevant cell for this step is { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Points\" }\n\n2. Next, we need to check the number of games played by Ipatinga. From the table, we can see that the number of games played by each team is located in the column labeled \"Total Games Played\". The row index for Ipatinga is 20. So, the relevant cell for this step is { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Games Played\" }\n\n3. After that, we need to check the number of games lost by Ipatinga. From the table, we can see that the number of games lost by each team is not directly provided in the table but it can be inferred from the number of points they have scored and deducted from the total games played (since 3 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, and 1 point for a draw). The relevant cells for this step would be { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Points\" }, { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Games Played\" }\n\n4. After finding the number of games lost, we compare it with the claimed value of 17. To do this, we calculate the number of losses by subtracting the total points from twice the total games played (since each win adds 3 points and a draw adds 1 point). So, the relevant calculations would be { \"operation\": \"Subtraction\", \"operands\": [ { \"value\": get_cell_value({ \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Points\" }), \"type\": \"Number\" }, { \"value\": 2 * get_cell_value({ \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Games Played\" }), \"type\": \"Number\" } ] }\n\n5. After performing the calculation, we compare the result with the claimed value of 17 to determine if it is true or false.\n\nThe final answer in a valid JSON object format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find total points scored by Ipatinga\",\n    \"Find total games played by Ipatinga\",\n    \"Calculate the number of games lost by Ipatinga\",\n    \"Compare the calculated number of games lost with the claimed value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Total Games Played\" }\n  ]\n}",
