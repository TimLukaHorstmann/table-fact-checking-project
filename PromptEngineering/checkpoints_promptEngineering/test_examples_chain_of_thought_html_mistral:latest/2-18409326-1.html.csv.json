This will give us the total number of unique stations.\n2. Next, identify all the rows where the 'format' column is equal to 'classic rock'. This will give us the number of classic rock stations.\n3. Compare the results from steps 1 and 2. If the number of classic rock stations is greater than 1, then the claim \"there be more than one classic rock station\" is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n- For counting unique stations (Step 1): All rows with different 'call sign'.\n- For identifying classic rock stations (Step 2): All rows where the 'format' column is equal to 'classic rock'.\n\nFinally, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of unique radio stations by considering all rows with different 'call sign'.\",\n    \"Identify all the rows where the 'format' column is equal to 'classic rock'.\",\n    \"Compare the number of unique stations and classic rock stations.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"call sign\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"call sign\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"call sign\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"format\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
