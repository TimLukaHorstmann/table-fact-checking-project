Check the table for any row where the 'total' column has a value of 2, specifically looking at the 'bronze' column as it is relevant to the claim.\n2. Inspect each row in the table, starting from the top and moving downwards.\n3. Observe that none of the rows (excluding the last row which represents the total count) have a value of 2 in the 'bronze' column for any nation.\n4. Compare the total count for bronze medals with the total count for other medal types (gold and silver).\n5. Note that the total count for gold and silver is 6, which does not match the claim of having a total of 2 for bronze.\n6.
