    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we identify the specific condition mentioned in the claim: \"unaffected be the bleeding time\", \"platelet count decrease\", and \"prothrombin time prolong\".\n\n2. Next, we search the table for a row that matches any of these conditions. However, since all the conditions should be present together, we need to find a row where all three conditions are met: unaffected bleeding time, decreased platelet count, and prolonged prothrombin time.\n\n3. We scan through the table, but there is no row that matches all three conditions together. Each row only has one or two of the mentioned conditions, not all three. Therefore, there's no row in this table that meets the conditions specified in the claim.\n\n4. Since we could not find a match for the conditions mentioned in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's format the answer according to the requested JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the specific conditions in the claim\",\n    \"Search the table for a row that matches all three conditions simultaneously\",\n    \"Scan through the table but find no match\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is FALSE as there's no row with all specified conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
