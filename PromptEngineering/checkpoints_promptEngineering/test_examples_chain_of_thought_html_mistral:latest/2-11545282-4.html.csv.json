There are 4 such players: Adrian Dantley (row index: 0), Darryl Dawkins (row index: 3), Paul Dawkins (row index: 4) and no player with row index 1,5,6 or 7.\n2. Determine the position of each 'Dawkins' player. Adrian Dantley is a guard-forward, Darryl Dawkins is a center, Paul Dawkins is a guard and there is no position specified for the other row. Since both Adrian Dantley and Paul Dawkins are guards (although one is also a forward), they satisfy the requirement of being guards.\n3. Check if their tenure with the Jazz overlaps. To do this, we compare the 'years for jazz' column of each player. Adrian Dantley played from 1979 to 1986 and Paul Dawkins played from 1979 to 1980. Since the earliest year (1979) and latest year (1980) do not overlap, their tenure does not overlap.\n4. Darryl Dawkins played from 1987 to 1988. Since none of the previously identified 'Dawkins' players ended or started their Jazz tenure in those years, their tenures with the Jazz also do not overlap with Darryl Dawkins'.\n5.
