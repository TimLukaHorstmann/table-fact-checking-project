After finding the championships where the player participated as a runner-up in 2004, compare them to check if they are the same championship (indicating the player was the runner-up at both). To do this, check for rows with 'indian wells' or 'miami' in the `championship` column and 'runner - up' in the `outcome` column. If any of these rows exist, it will indicate that the player was a runner-up in both Indian Wells and Miami during 2004.
