Check if the team used Climax straight - 4 engine: In row 5, the entrant is \"British Racing Partnership\", and in row 6 of the same year, we see another entry for this partnership using the \"Climax straight - 4\" engine (cooper t51). This is the second occurrence.\n5. Check if there are any other entries for British Racing Partnership with Climax straight - 4 engine in the given years: We do find another entry of British Racing Partnership using the same engine in row 4 (1959), but it does not confirm that Ivor Bueb was involved as there is no information about drivers.
