The winner should be Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva with the specified scores.\n\n2. Iterate through the table to find a row that matches the conditions:\n   - Loop through each row in the table.\n   - Check if the 'week of' column's value is 9th May or any other format equivalent to 9th May (e.g., 09-May).\n   - If the 'tier' column's value is not relevant for this check, but it would be good to keep in mind when comparing the semi-finalists and runner-up from the same tournament.\n   - Check if the 'runner - up' cell contains Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini.\n   - If the 'semi finalists' cell contains both Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce.\n   - If all the above conditions are met, then move to the next step; otherwise, continue to the next row.\n\n3. Check if the winner's name and scores match the specified ones:\n   - Compare the 'winner' cell's value against Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva.\n   - If the scores in the 'winner' cell match the specified scores 3 - 6, 7 - 6, 6 - 4.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim conditions\",\n    \"Iterate through table to find a row matching conditions\",\n    \"Check winner's name and scores\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"week of\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
