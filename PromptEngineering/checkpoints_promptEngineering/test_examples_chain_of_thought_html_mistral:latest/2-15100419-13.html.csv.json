Compare the values in the \"overall\" column for each row to find out who has an overall score of 252.\n3. If someone has an overall score of 252, then check their name and verify if it's Andrew Carnahan.\n4. If Andrew Carnahan is indeed found with an overall score of 252, then check the following row for a player with the name Chad Nkang and compare their overall score to confirm that he has the second-highest overall score (following Andrew Carnahan).\n\nNow let's verify the claim:\n\n- The relevant cells are:\n    [\n      { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"overall\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"name\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"overall\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"name\" }\n    ]\n\n- Andrew Carnahan's overall score is found to be 252 in row 12.\n- The player's name following Chad Nkang in the table should have an overall score less than or equal to 252, and this condition holds true (check rows 13 and 14).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant columns - 'overall' and 'name'.\",\n    \"Compare the values in the 'overall' column to find Andrew Carnahan.\",\n    \"Check if Chad Nkang's overall score is less than or equal to that of the player following him, which holds true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n      { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"overall\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"name\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"overall\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"name\" }\n  ]\n}",

The pick value for Chad Nkang is 41 and for Andrew Carnahan it is 42. These values match those given in the claim.\n\n3. Then, I checked the college values for these two players to see if they correspond to their claimed colleges. For Chad Nkang, the college is Elon, which matches the claim.

In this case, Andrew Carnahan's overall value is indeed greater than Chad Nkang's value (252 > 229).\n4.
