Check the remaining rows for a match with the catalog number ln24350. If there's a match, it means we have found the album.\n\n5. Since the title is not explicitly mentioned in the claim but implicitly given by the context of finding a specific album, verify if the title 'for little ones' appears for the matched catalog number ln24350.\n\n6. If there's no match with both the catalog number and the title, then the claim is FALSE. If there's a match with the catalog number but not the title, then the claim is only partially true.
