Identify the player we are interested in, which is 'bemidji state university' from the table's header under the \"college / junior / club team\" column.\n2. Check each row in the table to find a match where the value in the \"college / junior / club team\" column is 'bemidji state university'. In this case, it matches with the 93rd row (player: 'dale smedsmo').\n3. After finding a match, check the nationality of the player by looking at the \"nationality\" column for the same row.
