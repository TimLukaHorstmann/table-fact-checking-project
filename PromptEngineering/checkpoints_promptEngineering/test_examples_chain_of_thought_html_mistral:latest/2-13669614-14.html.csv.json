    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify the team for which we want to find the pitcher in the 7th inning. In this case, it's \"milwaukee braves\".\n2. Check the row where the team name matches with the table data. The relevant row is the first row (row_index = 0).\n3. Verify if the 4th column (pitcher) contains information about the pitchers for that game. In this case, it does contain two pitcher names: \"jim maloney\" and \"marshall bridges\".\n4. Determine if either of these pitchers is mentioned in any other row of the table. Since neither \"jim maloney\" nor \"marshall bridges\" appear again anywhere else in the table, they must be the only pitchers for the milwaukee braves in the given date.\n5. Check if the game's 7th inning is mentioned in the table. In this case, it is (5th step). The relevant column is the 4th column (inn).\n6. Compare the names of the pitchers found in the 4th column with the claim made: \"jim maloney\" and \"marshall bridges\".\n\nThe final answer to the given claim can be represented as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team for which we want to find the pitcher in the 7th inning.\",\n    \"Check the row where the team name matches with the table data.\",\n    \"Verify if the 4th column (pitcher) contains information about the pitchers for that game.\",\n    \"Determine if either of these pitchers is mentioned in any other row of the table.\",\n    \"Check if the game's 7th inning is mentioned in the table.\",\n    \"Compare the names of the pitchers found in the 4th column with the claim made\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"inn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
