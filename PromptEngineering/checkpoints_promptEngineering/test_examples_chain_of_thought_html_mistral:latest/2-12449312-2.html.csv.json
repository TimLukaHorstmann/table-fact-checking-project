List all the host cities and compare them with Chile's capital: Based on the table provided, we see that Chile has not hosted any of the Pan-American games until now. Since Santiago de Chile is not mentioned as a host city, it can be inferred that Chile cannot have won the most gold medals in the 15th Pan-American game because Chile did not even participate in it.\n\n3. Verify if there was a 15th Pan-American game: From the table provided, we see that the last row contains the total number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won from 1951 to 2011, but there is no information about the 15th game. So, if we assume that each edition represents a single Pan-American game, then there was no 15th Pan-American game as per this table.\n\n4.

Count the number of silver medals won in 1951, 2003 and 2011: Since we found the row related to Chile, we check the number of silver medals won in each event by looking at the \"silver\" column for those specific rows.\n\nNow let's output our answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row related to Chile.
