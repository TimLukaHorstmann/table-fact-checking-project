Examine the table to identify repetitions in the location column: We can see that the cities 'hiroshima' and 'bangkok' appear more than once, indicating that there might be a repetition of locations within the given data range. However, we need to check if these repetitions are indeed the years when equestrian events were held in those cities at the Asian Games.\n4. Verify the occurrence of equestrian events: To do this, we'll look for rows that have either 'gold', 'silver', or 'bronze' under the 'location' column (since these indicate medalists and thus confirm the presence of an equestrian event). In the given table, there are rows where those columns contain names, which means there were indeed equestrian events in those years.\n5. Identify repeating locations with confirmed equestrian events: We find that 'hiroshima' was host city for the Asian Games in 1994 and again in 1998. However, as we have verified in step 4, there were equestrian events held in both those years (since the 'gold', 'silver', or 'bronze' columns contain names).
