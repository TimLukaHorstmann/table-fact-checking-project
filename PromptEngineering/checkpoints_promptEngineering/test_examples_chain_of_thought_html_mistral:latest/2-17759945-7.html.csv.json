Identify the specific player(s) required by the claim: \"the cb player whose date of birth be 1975-07-14\" - In this case, we need to find the row that corresponds to the 'name' and 'pos' columns where the name is Tam\u00e1s Varga and the pos is cb.\n\n3. Verify the date of birth matches: Compare the 'date of birth' in the identified row with the given date 1975-07-14, ensuring they are equal.\n\n4.
