If they have a negative number, it means they are under par and if they have a positive number, it means they are over par. In this case, all players listed under t6 have \"+ 1\" in the \"to par\" column, which indicates that they are over par.\n\n4. Finally, since no player from the list of tied players has \"e\" in the \"to par\" column and they all have \"+ 1\", it can be concluded that the claim \"the 3 player tie at 2nd place be even to par\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n  },\n  // ... rest of the relevant rows until 11 (for Howard Clark)\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
