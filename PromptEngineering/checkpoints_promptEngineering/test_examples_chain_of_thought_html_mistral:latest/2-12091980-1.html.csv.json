Then, I will compare the values in the \"goals for\" column with 30 for each team.\n3. If any of the values are less than 30, then the claim is FALSE, as a game has been played where the goal for was less than 30.\n4. If all values in the \"goals for\" column are greater than or equal to 30, then the claim is TRUE, as no game had a goal for less than 30.\n\nAfter checking the table, it can be seen that all goals for are greater than 30. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check every row in the table\",\n    \"Compare 'goals for' column values with 30\",\n    \"If any value less than 30, claim is FALSE\",\n    \"If all values greater than or equal to 30, claim is TRUE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" }\n  ]\n}",
