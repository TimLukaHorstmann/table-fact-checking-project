Determine the order of the table rows based on their round number (1st column from the left) in ascending order.\n3. Start comparing the values in the \"pick\" column from the second row onwards (since we are looking for a pick after round 2) to find the first value that is greater than 27 (the pick of al simpson).\n4. Continue this comparison until we reach a pick number that is less than or equal to 158 (the pick of jim obradovich).\n5.
