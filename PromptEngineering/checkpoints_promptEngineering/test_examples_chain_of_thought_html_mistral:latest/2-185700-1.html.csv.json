Find the rows in the table where these song titles appear, noting their row indices. In this case, the row indices are 18 for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and 17 for \"croire\".\n3. Look at the points column of the found rows to compare the values. The point value for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" is 52, and for \"croire\" it is 90.\n4. Determine whether the point value for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" is higher than that of \"croire\". In this case, it is not.\n\n   Final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare song titles to find corresponding rows, compare points in those rows to determine if one has a higher value.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n}",
