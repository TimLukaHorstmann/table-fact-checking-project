Analyze the data: In the given table, there is only one row where Jos\u00e9 Acasuso and Sebasti\u00e1n Prieto are opponents, but Horia Tecau is not listed as his partner (row 5).

After finding matches with either Albert Costa or Rafael Nadal in the opponents list, I will look up the tournament name (from the \"tournament\" column) for those rows and verify that they correspond to any of the tournaments held in Russia.
