Scroll through the table row by row to find the row where the opponent matches the target (Dundee). The opponent column provides us with the team names, so we can easily identify the relevant rows based on that information.\n3. For each row in the table, check if the opponent matches Dundee. Since we know the team order in the table, we start from the first row and move down until we find a match. In this case, we find the matching row with index 3.\n4. Check the result column for the matched row: The result for the Dundee game is given as \"3 - 1\".\n5.
