Iterate through each row to find the year when 'best actress in a musical' award was given.\n3. Check if that particular year has an entry under 'laurence olivier award' as the ceremony.\n4. If there are multiple entries for that year, we need to check the category column of each entry to confirm that it's indeed 'best actress in a musical'.\n5. If any entry matches the specified criteria, check the result column to verify if it says 'won'.\n\nBased on the provided table:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the specific category we are interested in: best actress in a musical\",\n    \"Iterate through each row to find the year when 'best actress in a musical' award was given\",\n    \"Find the entry where ceremony is 'laurence olivier award'\",\n    \"Check if the category matches 'best actress in a musical'\",\n    \"Confirm that the result says 'won'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, we identify the columns that contain information about the year, nominee, and check if there's a row with a matching year for Imelda Staunton as the nominee.\n2. Next, we compare the year given in the claim (2012) with the years present in the table to see if they match.\n3. If we find a match between the year and the nominee in the same row, it means that Imelda Staunton was indeed a nominee in that year.\n4. We then compare the result for this potential match with the claim (since the claim is about being a nominee, not winning). If the result is 'nominated', we can say that the claim is false as Imelda Staunton was actually awarded the prize and not just nominated in 2013.\n\nSince we didn't find any match between the given year (2012) and nominee (Imelda Staunton), the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify columns for year, nominee; Compare year with table values; Find a row where year matches nominee's year; Compare result from this potential match with the claim (nominated)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
