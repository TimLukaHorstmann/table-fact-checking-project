Search for rows that match the required year (1970) and engine type (Ford Cosworth DFV).\n3. For each matching row, check if the chassis is the same as Lotus 49c.\n\n   After examining the table:\n   - There is no row where both the \"year\" and \"engine\" match the claim criteria (\"1970\" and \"ford cosworth dfv\"). However, we should check if there are any rows that only meet the year requirement since it might indicate a mistake in the table or the claim.\n   - A total of 5 rows have a matching year (1970). The engines for these years are: Ford straight - 4, Coventry Climax, Repco, Ford Cosworth DFV, and Ford Cosworth DFV.\n   - None of the engine entries correspond to Lotus 49c in this year, which is consistent with the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Search for rows that match the required year (1970) and engine type (Ford Cosworth DFV)\", \"Check if the chassis in each matching row is Lotus 49c\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
