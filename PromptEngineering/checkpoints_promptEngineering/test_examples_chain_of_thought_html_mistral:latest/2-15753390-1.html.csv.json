Sum the values in the \"points\" column across all rows to find the total points awarded.\n\nUsing Excel-like notation for the table (A1 refers to the cell in the first row and first column):\n\n* A2: sum of points for the first participant (15)\n* A3: sum of points for the second participant (12)\n* ...\n* A10: sum of points for the tenth participant (1)\n\nSo, the total points awarded are the sum of all cells from A2 to A10. In this case, it's 15 + 12 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 57.\n\nComparing this total with the claim: The claim states that a total of 15 points will be awarded across all participants, while we calculated a total of 57 points. Therefore, the calculated total is not equal to the claimed total.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the number of rows (participants), identify the column with points, sum the values in the 'points' column across all rows.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
