Next, we look through the rows of the table to check if there is ever a time when the points are greater than 12 and only 1 occasion when the points are less than 2.\n\n3. We start with the first row (row index 0). The team has played 7 games, drawn 0, lost 1, and has a goal difference of +41. Using the rules from step 1, we calculate the points: 3*wins + draws = 3*6 + 0 = 18. This is not greater than 12, but it does not meet our other criteria yet.\n\n4. We move on to the second row (row index 1). The team has played 7 games, drawn 0, lost 1, and has a goal difference of +40. Again, using the rules from step 1, we calculate the points: 3*6 + 0 = 18. This is not greater than 12, but it does not meet our other criteria yet.\n\n5. We continue this process for all rows in the table.
