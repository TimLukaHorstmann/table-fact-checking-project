    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the table's structure. It contains information about several quarterbacks (QBs) and their statistics: completions, attempts, completion %, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and QB rating.\n\n2. Next, we examine the claim, which states that \"100 touchdowns can be scored when the QB rating is 82.7\". To validate this claim, we need to find a QB in the table with both a QB rating of 82.7 and at least 100 touchdowns.\n\n3. We examine each row in the table for the given condition:\n   - Charley Johnson has a QB rating of 69.6, which is not 82.7, so we can disregard this row.\n   - Jake Plummer has a QB rating of 69.0, which is not 82.7, so we can disregard this row as well.\n   - Jim Hart has a QB rating of 66.6, which is also not 82.7, so we can eliminate this row.\n   - Kurt Warner has a QB rating of 91.9, which is higher than the required 82.7, so we can exclude him from consideration.\n   - Neil Lomax has a QB rating of 82.7. However, to confirm whether he scored at least 100 touchdowns, we need to look at the \"touchdowns\" column in his row.\n\n4. In the last step, we examine the \"touchdowns\" column for Neil Lomax's row:\n   - Lomax has a total of 136 touchdowns, which is greater than or equal to 100, the required number specified in the claim.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine table structure\",\n    \"Understand the given claim\",\n    \"Search the table for a QB with both a QB rating of 82.7 and at least 100 touchdowns\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"qb rating\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
