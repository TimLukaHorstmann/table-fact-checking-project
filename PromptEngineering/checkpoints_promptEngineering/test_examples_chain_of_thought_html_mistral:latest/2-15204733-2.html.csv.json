Locate all rows in the table that match the condition for the year (1986) and the remixer (laurent boutonnat). This will help us find out if laurent boutonnat remixed any versions in 1986.\n\n3. Identify the versions that laurent boutonnat is associated with in the table: \"long version\", \"remix\", and \"remix special club\".\n\n4. Check if these versions are also present for the year 1986 to verify if they were remixed by laurent boutonnat during that year.\n\n5. Compare the identified versions with their respective years:\n   - \"long version\" has a year of 1986 and is remixed by laurent boutonnat.\n   - \"remix\" has a year of 1986 and is remixed by laurent boutonnat.\n   - \"remix special club\" does not have the exact name as the ones mentioned in the claim, but it shares the same album (cendres de lune) with the 'remix' version and is also remixed by laurent boutonnat. Since both versions are associated with 1986, they can be considered as part of the comparison.\n\n6.

Find the row containing the carnal sin remix in the table: Search for the version with the name \"carnal sins remix\". In this case, it is located at the 10th row (index 9) as it is the only row where the version column has the value \"carnal sins remix\".\n\n3. Check the length of the carnal sin remix: Look for the length of the song in the row that was identified earlier. In this case, the length of the carnal sin remix can be found in the 4th cell of the 10th row (index 3 and 9), which is \"7:00\".\n\n4. Convert the length to seconds: Since the time is given in minutes and seconds (for example, \"7:00\" means 7 minutes and 0 seconds), we only need to consider the number of minutes. In this case, the number of minutes is already 7, so no conversion is needed.\n\n5.
