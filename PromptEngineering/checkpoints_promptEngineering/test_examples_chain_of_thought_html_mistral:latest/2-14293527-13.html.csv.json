The table provides details about various players, their positions, teams, and rounds.\n\n2. Filter the table based on the team and position: Since we are looking for a defensive player from Estevan Bruins, I filtered the table to only include rows where the team is \"Estevan bruins\" and the position is \"defense\".\n\n3. Examine the filtered data: In the filtered data, there is one row that matches our criteria (Glen Irwin in round 3).\n\n4. Check if the claim holds true: The claim states that round 3 will have a defensive player from Estevan Bruins. Since we found Glen Irwin, a defensive player from Estevan Bruins, in round 3, the claim is indeed TRUE.\n\nNow, here's the final answer as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and data\",\n    \"Filter the table based on team and position\",\n    \"Examine the filtered data\",\n    \"Check if the claim holds true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\" }\n  ]\n}",
