Find the rows in the table where the \"visitor\" column equals the Nuggets.\n3. Locate the row where the \"home team\" (opponent) equals the Trail Blazers.\n4. Check if this specific game resulted in a loss for the Nuggets (since the question asks whether they lose to the Trail Blazers).\n5. Compare the overall record of the Nuggets before and after this game to see if it changes from 6 - 3.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify team (Nuggets)\",\n    \"Find rows where visitor is Nuggets\",\n    \"Locate row where opponent is Trail Blazers\",\n    \"Check if this game resulted in a loss for the Nuggets\",\n    \"Compare overall record before and after this game\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
