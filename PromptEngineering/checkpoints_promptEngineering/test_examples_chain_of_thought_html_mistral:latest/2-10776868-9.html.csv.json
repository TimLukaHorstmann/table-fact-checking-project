Find all the rows in the table that have a date from 1962: In this table, there are multiple rows with the date \"23 june 1962\". This means that games were played on that date in the VFL season of 1962.\n\n3. Check if all games happened on the same day: Since we found multiple games played on \"23 june 1962\", it implies that all the matches in this table took place on that same day, which is the VFL season's round for June 23, 1962.\n\n4. Compare the claim with our findings: The claim is about whether there was a VFL season in 1962 and if games were played on June 23.
