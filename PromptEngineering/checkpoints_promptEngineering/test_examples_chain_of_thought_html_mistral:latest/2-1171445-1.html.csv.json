Identify the player for whom we need to check the quarter-finalist status: The claim mentions Yannick Noah Leconte, but the table provides data for a different player named Yannick Noah (with no surname mentioned). However, given that the table title suggests tennis tournaments and the provided data matches the pattern of a professional tennis career, we can assume that it refers to Yannick Noah Leconte.\n\n2. Find the relevant rows in the table: We need to check the US Open and French Open rows since the claim mentions those two tournaments. The row numbers for these tournaments are 3 (US Open) and 1 (French Open).\n\n3. Check the quarter-finalist status: In the third row, which corresponds to the US Open, the cell under '1984' has a value of 'qf'. In the first row, which corresponds to the French Open, the cell under '1987' has a value of 'sf', which stands for semi-finalist. However, there is no 'qf' in this row. We know that quarterfinals are a stage before semifinals, but there might be other reasons for labeling the round as 'sf'. To confirm if Leconte made it to the quarterfinals at the French Open, we would need additional information or context about the tournament and the specific labeling of rounds.\n\n4.
