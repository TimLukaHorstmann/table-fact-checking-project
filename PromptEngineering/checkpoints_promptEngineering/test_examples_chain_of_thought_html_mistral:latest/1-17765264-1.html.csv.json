    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to verify if any of the dates listed in the table correspond to November 6, 1960. This will help us determine the matches played on that day.\n2. Next, we should check the \"result\" column for games on November 6, 1960 to see if there's a tied game (a result with a score of something like 't 38 - 38').\n3. If we find a tied game, then we can conclude that it's not unique for the year since the table contains multiple games played on different dates and against various opponents. On the other hand, if there is no tied game found on November 6, 1960, then the claim would be false because there wouldn't be any record of a tied game that year (only the matches listed in the table).\n\nNow, let's search for the relevant rows:\n\n- First, find the row with the date 'november 6 , 1960'. In this table, the row index is 9.\n- Then, verify the \"result\" cell of that row to check if it's a tied game. In this case, the result in row 9 is 'l 25 - 45', which indicates a loss and not a tie.\n\nWith this information, we can conclude that there are no tied games on November 6, 1960 according to the provided table, so the claim \"november 6 , 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is false.\n\nHere's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Search for any games on November 6, 1960.\",\n    \"Check if the found game has a 'tied' result.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"Date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
