However, it appears that \"cape comorin\" might be a typo or abbreviation for \"Cape Comorin Offshore Wind Power\", as the producer's name matches with \"Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Ltd\".\n2. The second step is to find the total capacity (mwe) of the power plant. In the table, we can see that the row corresponding to \"Cape Comorin\" has a value of 33.0 in the \"total capacity (mwe)\" column.\n3. The third step is to compare the claim with the information found from the table. The claim states that the total capacity (mwe) at the power plant located in Cape Comorin should be 25.
