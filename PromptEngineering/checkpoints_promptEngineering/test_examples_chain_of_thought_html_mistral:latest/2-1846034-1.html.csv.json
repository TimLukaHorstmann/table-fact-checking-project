Check the table columns to see if there is a row corresponding to Great Britain (GBR) and a column for 'bronze'.\n3. If there is such a row, we can check if the value in the 'bronze' column for that row equals 1.\n4. Based on the values in the table, if the value in the 'bronze' column for Great Britain (GBR) equals 1, then the claim is true. If it doesn't equal 1, then the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the nation: Great Britain (GBR).\", \"Check if there is a row for GBR and a column for 'bronze'.\", \"If there is such a row, check if the value in the 'bronze' column for GBR equals 1.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}]\n}",
