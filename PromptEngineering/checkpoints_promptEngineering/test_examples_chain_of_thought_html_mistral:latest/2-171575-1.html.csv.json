Next, we examine the table: We see that each row corresponds to a different movie with various attributes such as rank, title, studio, director, and worldwide gross.\n3. Then, we find the row corresponding to the first rank: In this case, it is the row where the 'rank' column value is 1.\n4. After that, we check the value of the 'worldwide gross' column for the row we found in step 3: In this case, the value is \"914691118\".\n5. Finally, we compare the claim with our findings from steps 3 and 4: The worldwide gross receipt for the film in rank 1 matches the amount given in the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand the claim\", \"Examine the table\", \"Find the row corresponding to rank 1\", \"Check the 'worldwide gross' column for the found row\", \"Compare the claim with our findings\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"worldwide gross\"}]\n}",
