Identify the table structure: The table contains data about various matches, with columns for home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\n3. Search for the relevant rows in the table: To verify if South Melbourne is a home team, we need to find a row where the \"home team\" column's value is \"South Melbourne\". Similarly, to check if Fitzroy is an away team, we should look for a row with \"Fitzroy\" as the value of the \"away team\" column.\n\n4. Compare the home and away teams: Once we have identified the relevant rows, we can compare them to see if they meet the requirement that South Melbourne is the home team (listed first) and Fitzroy is the away team (listed second).\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The claim states that \"Footscray is the home team when the away team scores 9.4 (58)\".\n\n2. Search the table for the row containing the away team score of 9.4 (58): The away team scores are in the third column, and the value 9.4 (58) can be found in the second row.\n\n3. Find the corresponding home team from that row: The home team is listed in the first column of the table. For the second row, the home team is \"Collingwood\".\n\n4. Verify if Footscray is the away team for this match: To check this, look at the second row again and find the away team in the third column. In this case, it is Hawthorn.\n\n5. Compare the given claim with the verified information: The away team in the match where Collingwood scored 17.13 (115) was not Footscray, but instead Hawthorn.
