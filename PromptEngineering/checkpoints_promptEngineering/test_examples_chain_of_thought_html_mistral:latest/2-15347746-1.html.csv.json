Sort the table by 'round' in ascending order to see when Central Florida players were picked first.\n3. Iterate through each row and compare the 'team' column with 'Central Florida'. In this case, there are two players from Central Florida: Kevin Smith (row 3) and an unnamed player at row 6 (assuming multiple players per row are separated by commas).\n4.
