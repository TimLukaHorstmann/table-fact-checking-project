The table contains details about various drivers and their performance in a race, including their car model, number of laps completed (or retirement), and reasons for retirement if applicable.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to Cesare Perdisa. In this case, his row index is 14.\n\n3. Check the value under the column \"laps completed\" or any column that indicates whether a driver has retired or not for Cesare Perdisa. The value in row 14, column 2 is \"+ 6 laps\", which suggests that he retired after completing 6 less laps than the total number of laps in the race.\n\n4. To confirm whether this means a \"time/retire of + 6 laps\", check if there exists any column indicating the time taken by each driver to complete their respective laps. In this case, there is no such column that indicates the time taken to complete laps. However, since the table explicitly mentions the number of laps completed and retired for each driver, we can infer that a \"laps completed\" value less than the total race laps (with a + sign) implies a retirement.\n\n5.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. To determine if Robert Manzon, who completed 88 laps, had an average grid of 22, we first need to find his starting position (or grid number) by looking for the row that corresponds to him in the table.\n2. The table is organized by car make and driver name. We look for Robert Manzon's row under Maserati, as indicated by the relevant_cells provided.\n3. In the Maserati rows, we find Robert Manzon with 88 laps completed, but no grid number is given in this table. Instead, we notice that there are two columns related to grid position: \"Start\" and \"Finish.\"\n4. Since we don't know if Robert Manzon started from his final grid position or moved up or down the grid during the race, we cannot directly calculate an average grid for him based on this information alone.\n5. However, if we assume that drivers often start from their final grid position, then Robert Manzon would have started from row 88 (as he completed 88 laps), and his average grid could be calculated by dividing 88 by the total number of drivers in the race.\n6. To find the total number of drivers, we count the number of rows with driver names in the table. We find 47 drivers (excluding Jack Brabham and Ron Flockhart who DNF, as they are not included in the lap count).\n7. If we use this assumption, then the average grid for Robert Manzon would be 88 / 47 = approximately 1.87, which is not equal to 22. Therefore, according to our assumption that drivers often start from their final grid position, Robert Manzon did NOT have an average grid of 22.\n8. However, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the original claim without more information about when and where in the grid Robert Manzon started the race.\n\nanswer: FALSE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"Driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Start\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Finish\"}]",
