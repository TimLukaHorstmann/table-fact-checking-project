Compare the crowd sizes: To check if the claim is true, we need to find two sets of crowds that meet the following conditions:\n   - The first set belongs to the home team footscray and away team geelong (these are the teams in the first row).\n   - The second set belongs to any other match from 26 August 1961 (any row except the first one).\n   - Both sets should have equal crowd numbers.\n\n4. Check if such pairs exist: Look for a pair of rows that meet the conditions in step 3. If found, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date and game data\",\n    \"Find crowd size for each match\",\n    \"Compare crowd sizes of footscray-geelong vs another game on the same day\",\n    \"Check if a pair with equal crowds exists\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },  // footscray-geelong crowd size\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },  // carlton-melbourne crowd size\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },  // st kilda-north melbourne crowd size\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },  // richmond-hawthorn crowd size\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },  // essendon-collingwood crowd size\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }   // check for any other row with equal crowd size to footscray-geelong\n  ]\n}",
