Search for rows where the cause of retirement is 'suspension': In this table, there is only one row (row 12) where the cause of retirement is 'suspension'.\n\n3. Check if there are any other rows with the same cause: Since we have already found a row with 'suspension' as the cause, and there are no other such rows in the table, the claim does not hold true for this data.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the condition of the claim.\",\n    \"Search for rows where the cause of retirement is 'suspension'.\",\n    \"Check if there are any other rows with the same cause.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
