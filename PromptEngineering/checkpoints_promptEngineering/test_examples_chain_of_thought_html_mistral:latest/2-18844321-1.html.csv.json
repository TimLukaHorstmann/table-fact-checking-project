    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the key information needed to verify the claim: The claim states that there were 13 tour matches in the last 3 months of 1978. To verify this, we need to determine the number of tour matches and find out if they are from the last 3 months of 1978.\n\n2. Count the number of tour matches: We can see that each row of the table represents a match between England (the team represented by the second column value) and an opposing team (first column). The status for each match is \"tour match\" (third column), except for the last two rows, which are test matches.\n\n3. Determine if the matches are from the last 3 months of 1978: We can see that the dates provided are in DD MMMM YYYY format. We will convert them to DD/MM/YYYY for easier comparison. The last three months of 1978 are November, December, and October (in reverse order because it's a table). We will check each match date against these three months.\n\n4. Compare the dates with the given months:\n- For the first row, the date is 18th October 1978. This is within October, so it counts towards the total.\n- For the second row, the date is 21st October 1978. This is still within October, so it counts towards the total.\n- ... (and so on for the rest of the rows)\n\n5. Count the number of tour matches and check if they are from the last three months: After going through all the matches, we find that there were 13 tour matches, all of which were in October, November, or December of 1978.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Count the number of rows where the status is 'tour match'.
