In the table, the column 'pick' contains numbers which represent each player's draft position, and the column 'player' contains the player's name along with their position enclosed in parentheses. So, we will look for '(d)' in the 'player' column to find the defensemen.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the first 5 picks. In this table, the 'round' column provides the round number, which can help us track the order of draft picks. However, since the table starts with round 1, every pick in the first five rows should be considered (i.e., row_index from 1 to 5).\n\n3. Combine the information from steps 1 and 2 to find out if at least 3 of the first 5 picks are defensemen. We compare the player positions with '(d)' in the 'player' column for rows from 1 to 5 (i.e., rows with pick numbers 11, 47, 64, 80, and 97).\n\nBased on this reasoning, here is the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We are looking for defensemen (d) among the first 5 picks in the table.
