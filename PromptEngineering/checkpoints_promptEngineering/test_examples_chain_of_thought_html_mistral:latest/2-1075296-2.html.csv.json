    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the driver we are looking for: Michael Schumacher\n2. Check the constructor of the identified driver: Ferrari (the table row with \"michael schumacher\" as driver value)\n3. Confirm that the constructor of the identified driver matches the claim's constructor: Ferrari (true)\n4. Identify the grid column to find the average grid number for the identified driver\n5. Check the grid values for each lap of the identified driver in the table row with \"michael schumacher\" as driver value\n6. Find the average grid number by summing up all the grid values and dividing it by the total number of laps (in this case, since there is only one grid value, we can directly compare it with the claim)\n7. Check the time / retired column to find the time for the identified driver: 1:32:35.101 (the table row with \"michael schumacher\" as driver value)\n8. Compare the time / retired value with the claim's time / retire value: 1:32:35.101 (true)\n9. Since both conditions (constructor and time / retire) match the claim, we can conclude that the statement is TRUE\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify driver: Michael Schumacher\",\n    \"Check constructor of identified driver: Ferrari\",\n    \"Confirm constructor matches claim: True\",\n    \"Find average grid number for identified driver (sum of grid values and divide by total laps)\",\n    \"Compare average grid number with claim's grid number\",\n    \"Check time / retired value for identified driver\",\n    \"Compare time / retired value with claim's time / retire value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"grid\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Time / Retired\" }\n  ]\n}",
