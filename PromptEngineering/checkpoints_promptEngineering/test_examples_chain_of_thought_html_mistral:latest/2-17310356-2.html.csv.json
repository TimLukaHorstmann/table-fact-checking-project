In the second and third rows, we find Andrea Ronchi (Minister of European Affairs) and Anna Maria Bernini (also Minister of European Affairs). Both belong to the People of Freedom party. However, only Andrea Ronchi's tenure precedes Bernini's, so they cannot both be considered as the \"only\" minister of European affairs from the People of Freedom party.\n5.
