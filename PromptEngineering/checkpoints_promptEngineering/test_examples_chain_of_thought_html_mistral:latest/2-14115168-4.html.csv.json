Since the claim states that only one school has won more than 20 titles, our goal is to find out how many schools have fewer or equal to 20 titles and compare it with the total number of schools.\n3. Start going through the rows in the table (from row 1 to row 10) and read the value under the \"national titles\" column for each school.\n4. Keep a count of the number of schools that have won fewer or equal to 20 titles, and compare it with the total number of schools. If the count is less than 9 (since we already know that York College has more than 20 titles), then the claim would be FALSE because more than one school would have had fewer than 21 titles combined.\n5. If the count is exactly 9, then it means all other schools (except York College) have won fewer or equal to 20 titles.
