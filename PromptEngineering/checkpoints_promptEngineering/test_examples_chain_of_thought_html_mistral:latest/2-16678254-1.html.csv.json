    "resp": "1. Extract the data from the table, specifically focusing on the week column to find the row corresponding to week 8 (november 13 , 1949).\n2. Determine the row index of week 8 by matching the date with the date provided in the claim (in this case, the row index should be 8 as the data shows that week 8 occurred on november 13 , 1949).\n3. Check the result column for the row identified in step 2. The result column provides the outcome of each game.\n4. Compare the result from step 3 with the result specified in the claim (w for win, l for loss, t for tie). If they match, then the claim is true.\n5. Check the score column for the row identified in step 2 to confirm that the score matches the score specified in the claim (65 - 20). If they match, then the claim is completely true (i.e., not only did week 8 have a win but also with the specified score of 65 - 20).\n\nWith the above reasoning steps, we can confirm that the claim \"week 8 on november 13 , 1949 have a w result with a score of 65 - 20\" is true.
