Since they do not appear together before 2000, and since Team Yellow Racing appears again in the table after 2000, it's reasonable to assume that Mike Skinner raced for one of these teams in the intervening years. We can therefore consider any rows where either team is listed as potentially related to Mike Skinner.\n\n2. Check each row for the number of starts. If the number of starts matches 9 (as claimed), and if the team in that row was either Team Yellow Racing or Andy Petree Racing (which merged with Richard Childress Racing), then we have a match.\n\n3.
