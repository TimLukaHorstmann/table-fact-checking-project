However, since there's no match between the given claim and the data in the table, we need to verify if any other matches exist with clay as a surface.\n\n3. Search for other matches with clay surface: Scroll down the table and look for rows where the surface is \"clay\".\n\n4. Verify if any of these matches have the score that corresponds to the claim: We found several matches with clay as a surface, but none of them has the score (6 - 4, 2 - 6, 3 - 6).\n\nSince there's no match in the table where both the score and surface (clay) correspond to the given claim, our conclusion is that the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\" } (to check if there's a match with clay)\n- { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" } (to verify the score given in the claim)\n- { \"row_index\": [1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], \"column_name\": \"surface\" } (to search for other matches with clay as surface)\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the score that corresponds to the claim\",\n    \"Verify if the match has the same surface as given in the claim\",\n    \"Search for other matches with clay as a surface\",\n    \"Check if any of these matches have the score that corresponds to the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": [1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], \"column_name\": \"surface\" }\n  ]\n}",
