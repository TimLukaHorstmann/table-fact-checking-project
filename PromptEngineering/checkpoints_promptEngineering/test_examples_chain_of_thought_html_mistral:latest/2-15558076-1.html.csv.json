Compare this count with the counts from all other teams in the table, to determine which team has been the designated visitor the greatest number of times.\n4. The New England Patriots appear multiple times in the table (rows 2008, 2012, and 2013). We need to count how many times they were designated visitors.\n5. In row 2008, the designated visitors are the New York Giants, so they are not the New England Patriots and do not contribute to our count. Similarly, in rows 2012 and 2013, the designated visitors are the St Louis Rams (row 2012) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (row 2013), respectively.\n6. The only row where the New England Patriots are listed as the designated visitors is row 2013. Therefore, the count for the New England Patriots as designated visitors is one.\n7. We now compare this count with that of all other teams in the table. To do so, we would need to repeat steps 4-6 for each team in the \"designated visitors\" column and find the maximum count. However, since the goal is to determine whether the New England Patriots have been the designated visitor the greatest number of times, we can stop at this point because we already know they have been designated visitors once.\n8.

Examine the dates of these games to find out if they mostly occur in late September.\n4. Define \"late September\" as between September 21 and September 30, inclusively (since the games are on specific days within each month).\n5. Count how many games were played in late September and compare it with the total number of games played in those years.\n6.
