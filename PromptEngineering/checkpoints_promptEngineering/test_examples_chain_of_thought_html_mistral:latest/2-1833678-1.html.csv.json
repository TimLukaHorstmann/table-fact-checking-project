To do this, I searched for rows where the 'year' is 2012 and the 'nominated work' is \"evita\".\n\n2. Since the 'award' column contains different awards, I examined each row that satisfies the condition above to determine if it corresponds to either a Tony Award or Drama Desk Award.\n\n3. I found two rows where the nominated work was Evita and the year was 2012: one for the Tony Award in the 'best performance by a featured actor in a musical' category, and another for the Drama Desk Award in the 'outstanding featured actor in a musical' category.\n\n4. Both of these rows contain 'nominated' as the result, indicating that Evita was indeed nominated for both the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award in 2012.\n\nNow, let me present my findings in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the award categories for which Evita was nominated in 2012 by searching for rows where the 'year' is 2012 and the 'nominated work' is 'evita'.\",\n    \"Examine each row that satisfies the condition to determine if it corresponds to either a Tony Award or Drama Desk Award.\",\n    \"Check the result column (which contains 'nominated') for both found rows to confirm the nominations\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 49, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 49, \"column_name\": \"nominated work\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 50, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 50, \"column_name\": \"nominated work\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 49, \"column_name\": \"award\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 50, \"column_name\": \"award\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 49, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 50, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
