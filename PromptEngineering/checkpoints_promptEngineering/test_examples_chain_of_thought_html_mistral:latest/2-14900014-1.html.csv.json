However, by observing the table, we can see that the team with a record of 0-8 plays their 9th game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers (row 10), but they lose that game. The team plays against Cincinnati Bengals (row 11) and Detroit Lions (row 13) before that, both losses as well.\n\n2. Since the team has not played their 8th game yet, it's clear that the 8th game must be at home because the pattern of games alternates between home and away. The 7th game was played at Detroit (row 13), so the 8th game should have been at home.\n\n3. To find out where the 8th game was played, we look for the game that fits this description: it's the home game before the game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers (since they lost to Tampa Bay and their next loss is against Cincinnati Bengals), and it should have been a loss since the team has a record of 0-8.\n\n4. By observing the table, we can see that the home game before the Tampa Bay Buccaneers match (row 10) is against Green Bay Packers (row 12). This game was won by the Saints (indicated by 'w' in the \"Result\" column), so it cannot be the 8th game.\n\n5. The only remaining possibility for the 8th game is the one before the Detroit Lions match (row 13). This game is against the Cincinnati Bengals (row 11) and was a loss, as indicated by 'l' in the \"Result\" column.\n\n6. Finally, we check where this game was played. The row number corresponds to the number of the game, so the 8th game is row 8 (since we are looking for the game before the Detroit Lions match).
