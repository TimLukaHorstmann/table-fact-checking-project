Compare the \"score\" column values of the rows identified in step 2 for a consistent pair (one for home team score and one for away team score).\n4. Check if both scores form a pair where the home team's score is 111 and the away team's score is 106.\n5.

Identify the relevant columns in the table for determining the location of the game and the score of the game:\n    - Location / Attendance column: This column provides the location where each game was played. We need this information to check if a game was played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum.\n    - Score column: This column provides the scores of each game, which we need to compare with the score mentioned in the claim (113 - 106).\n\n2. Iterate through the rows of the table to find games that were played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum and have a score matching the claimed score (113 - 106):\n    - We see that many games were played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum, but we only need to look for a game with a score matching 113 - 106.\n    - By examining the scores in the table, we find that game number 12 was played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum and has a score of 113 - 106.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns (Location / Attendance and Score), Iterate through rows to find games with scores matching the claimed score at Alexander Memorial Coliseum.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Location / Attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Score\" }\n  ]\n}",
