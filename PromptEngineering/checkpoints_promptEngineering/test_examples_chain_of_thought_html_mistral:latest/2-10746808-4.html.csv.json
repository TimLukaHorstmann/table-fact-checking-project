Second, we look for the corresponding away team from the claim (fitzroy) and check if it appears as the away team in the matched row from step 1.

Fourth, we compare the away team score mentioned in the claim with the away team score from the matched row in the table. Since the scores are negative integers and the goal of the game is to have a higher score, we need to convert both values into their absolute values for accurate comparison. If the converted away team score from the table is higher, then the claim is FALSE because the away team cannot lose by a positive score difference.\n5. Lastly, if none of the previous steps resulted in the claim being proven FALSE, we check if the date mentioned in the claim (22 may 1926) matches with the date from the matched row in the table.
