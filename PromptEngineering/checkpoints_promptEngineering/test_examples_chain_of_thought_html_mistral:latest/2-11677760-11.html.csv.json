Find the relevant row in the table: We are looking for the row where \"player\" is \"raymond felton\".\n\n3. Check the height column of the identified row: In the fifth row, the value under the \"height\" column is \"6 - 2\", which indicates a height of 6 feet 2 inches.\n\n4. Compare the claim with the found value: The claimed height (6-2) matches with the found value (6-2), meaning they are equal.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the relevant row\", \"Check the height column of the identified row\", \"Compare the claim with the found value\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify Raymond Felton from the table based on his name.\n2. After identifying Raymond Felton, we will verify his height by checking the 'height' column for the row that corresponds to him.\n3. Next, we will check the 'hometown' column for the same row to verify whether it matches \"arron, oh\". Note that there seems to be a spelling error in the claim (it should be \"akron\" instead of \"arron\").\n4. If both height and hometown match with the data in the table, then the claim is TRUE.\n5.
