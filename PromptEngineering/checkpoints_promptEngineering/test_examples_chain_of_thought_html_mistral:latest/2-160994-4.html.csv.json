Filter the table for NFL teams in Europe: The table does not provide information about the sport associated with each team, but based on the names of the teams, it can be assumed that they are American football (NFL) teams as the table is about European cities and stadiums.

Compare the capacities: Check if Wembley Stadium's capacity (8000) is greater than the capacities of other European NFL stadiums.

Determine if there are any NFL stadiums in Europe with a larger capacity than Wembley Stadium: Since we couldn't find any NFL stadium capacities in the table, and the largest capacity among the listed venues is smaller than the given capacity of Wembley Stadium, it is reasonable to assume that no NFL stadium in Europe has a larger capacity.\n\n4. Verify if \"wembley stadium\" can be considered as an NFL stadium in Europe: Since the table doesn't provide information about whether the listed stadiums are specifically NFL stadiums or not, we cannot definitively say that Wembley Stadium is an NFL stadium in Europe.
