    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim, which is whether \"Prince Park\" was home to the \"Carlton\" team on July 14th, 1945.\n2. Check each row of the table to find out which team played at Prince Park on that day. The row number can be determined by looking for a team name (\"Carlton\") and a venue (\"Princes Park\").\n3. In the table, there is one row where both conditions are met: Carlton (row index 2) and Princes Park (column index 5).\n4. Check the home team score of this row to verify if it represents a home match. The higher score in a match is usually associated with the home team. In this case, Carlton has a higher score than Hawthorn, confirming that it is indeed the home team on this date.\n5. Since we have found a match where both conditions are met and the row represents a home game for Carlton at Princes Park, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check claim: 'Prince Park be home to the carlton team'.\",\n                      \"Identify each team playing at Prince Park on July 14th, 1945.\",\n                      \"Iterate through each row of the table.\",\n                      \"Find row where both conditions are met (team = 'Carlton' and venue = 'Princes Park').\",\n                      \"Check if home team score is higher, indicating a home match.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n                     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]\n}",
