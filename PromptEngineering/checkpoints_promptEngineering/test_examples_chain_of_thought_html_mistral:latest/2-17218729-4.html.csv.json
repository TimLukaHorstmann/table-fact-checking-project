Check for games where Pittsburgh is the visitor team, since they are the ones being considered for having an attendance of 14995 and a score greater than 24 points.\n2. Scan through the table and look for rows where the \"home\" column contains Pittsburgh.\n3. Identify the rows that also have attendance equal to 14995 by comparing each row's attendance value with the desired value.\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, find all the rows where the team is Pittsburgh (column 'visitor'). This will give us a list of all games played by Pittsburgh.\n2. Then, among these games, find those that occurred after December 19th (column 'date'). This will give us a list of games played by Pittsburgh after December 19th.\n3. For each game in this list, check if the total points scored by Pittsburgh is more than 24 (column 'points').\n4. Also for each game in this list, check if the attendance was 14995 or more (column 'attendance').\n5. If any game meets both criteria (more than 24 points and at least 14995 attendees), then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBased on the table provided:\n- There are a total of 15 rows, but since we're only interested in Pittsburgh games, let's filter out the first 5 rows where the team isn't Pittsburgh. This leaves us with rows 6 to 15.\n- Among these 10 rows, there is no game that occurred after December 19th and had more than 24 points scored by Pittsburgh or an attendance of at least 14995.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find all games played by Pittsburgh, then filter for games post-December 19th, check if points > 24 and attendance >= 14995 in these filtered games\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n    // ... for all relevant cells in the remaining rows where Pittsburgh is the visitor\n  ]\n}",
