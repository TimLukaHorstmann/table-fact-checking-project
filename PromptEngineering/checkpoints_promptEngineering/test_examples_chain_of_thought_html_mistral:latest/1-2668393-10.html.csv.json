For this, I will look for rows where the \"first elected\" is either blank or older than 1802 and the \"incumbent\" is not empty. The relevant cells for this comparison are:\n   - District 1 (row_index=0): first elected in 1799, incumbent is John Smith\n   - District 2 (row_index=1): no information about first elected year, but there's an election between candidates\n   - District 5 (row_index=3): no information about first elected year, but there's an election between candidates\n   - District 6 (row_index=4): no information about first elected year, but there's an election between candidates\n   - District 10 (row_index=5): no information about first elected year, but there's an election between candidates\n   - District 12 (row_index=6): first elected in 1800, incumbent is David Thomas\n   - District 14 (row_index=7): no information about first elected year, but there's an election between candidates\n\n3.
