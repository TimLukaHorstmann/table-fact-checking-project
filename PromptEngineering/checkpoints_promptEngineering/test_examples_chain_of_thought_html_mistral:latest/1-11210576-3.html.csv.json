    "resp": "Here's the reasoning:\n1. Identify the character whose duration from row 3 to row 5 needs to be found, according to the claim. That character is Max Martini.\n2. Check the table to find out the role of Max Martini. The column \"role\" in row 74 indicates that Max Martini is a DEA Agent.\n3. Since the claim pertains to the duration of episodes, not roles, we need to find episodes where Max Martini appears.\n4. To do this, find the rows where Max Martini's name (column \"Name\") appears. The relevant row indices for Max Martini are 71, 72, and 73 (not including 74).\n5. In each of these rows, check the columns related to the episode numbers. If the claim is correct, there should be episode numbers from 02x03 to 03x05 in one or more rows for Max Martini.\n6. Examine the relevant cells for each row:\n   - In row 71, the column \"Episode\" has the value \"02x08\". This does not match the claim (it's not between 02x03 and 03x05).\n   - In row 72, the column \"Episode\" has no value. This also does not match the claim.\n   - In row 73, the column \"Episode\" has the value \"03x20-03x22\". Some of the episode numbers match the claim (03x20 and 03x22), but they are outside the range specified in the claim (from 02x03 to 03x05).\n7. Since none of the relevant cells contain the required values, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n   Here's the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the character in question.\",\n    \"Check the role of the character.\",\n    \"Find episodes where the character appears.\",\n    \"Examine the relevant cells for each episode to verify the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 71,\n      \"column_name\": \"Episode\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 72,\n      \"column_name\": \"Episode\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 73,\n      \"column_name\": \"Episode\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
