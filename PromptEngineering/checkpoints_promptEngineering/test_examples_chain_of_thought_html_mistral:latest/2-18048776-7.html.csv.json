    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, we need to find Vijay Singh's score to par and position in the table. According to the table, Vijay Singh has a total score of 271 (4 rounds of golf summed up). Since par for each round is not specified, but the number of strokes under par is given as 9, we can calculate that the par for each round should be 271/4 = 67.5 (approximately). So, Vijay Singh finished 9 strokes under par which means he was 9*4=36 strokes under par for the tournament.\n\n2. Next, we compare his score to par with other players' scores in the table. We need to find a player who is within 2 strokes of Vijay Singh (as claimed that Vijay finished 2 strokes ahead). According to the table, Steve Stricker has a total score of 273 which is 2 strokes more than Vijay's score (271).\n\n3. Lastly, we check if there are any other players who could have tied with Vijay Singh for the first place but ended up in a lower position in the table. From the table, we can see that no player has a total score equal to or less than 271 (Vijay's score).\n\nSince all these steps support the claim that \"vijay singh win the 1998 pga championship by finish 9 under par , 2 strokes in front of steve stricker\", our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find Vijay Singh's score to par by calculating total strokes minus par (4*number of strokes under par); Compare Vijay Singh's score to par with other players' scores in the table, focusing on those within 2 strokes; Check if there are any players who could have tied but ended up in a lower position in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We can do this by finding all rows where the country column says \"United States\".

Convert the score from the format given (70 + 66 + 67 + 68 = 271) into a single number, which is -1 for 2 under par. This can be done by subtracting the total score from the standard tournament score of 72 times the number of rounds played (4 in this case). So, 271 - (4 * 72) = -1.\n3. Identify Steve Elkington, who is in the 3rd row of the table. We can see his score and to par values in the 3rd and 4th columns respectively.\n4. Convert Steve Elkington's score into a single number by subtracting it from the standard tournament score (72 * 4) as well. So, 274 - (4 * 72) = 6.\n5. Check if Vijay Singh's to par (-1) is less than Steve Elkington's to par (6), since a lower to par means a better score. In this case, it is indeed true that -1 < 6.\n6. Check the table for additional information on who won the tournament. There doesn't seem to be any column indicating the winner of the championship. However, we can make an educated guess based on the to par values provided.\n7.
