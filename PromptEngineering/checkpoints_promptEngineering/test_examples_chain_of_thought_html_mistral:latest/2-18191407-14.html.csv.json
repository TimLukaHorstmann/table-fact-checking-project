The shooter is Yin Wen from China, the event is not specified but since it's about a World Cup Final, we can infer that it's one of the rows related to a World Cup event. The qualification criterion for our claim is \"defending champion\", which means the athlete must have won the title in the previous edition of this particular event.\n\n2. Search the table row by row looking for the shooter (Yin Wen) and any event where she has been a defending champion. The column names \"event\" might not be present in all rows, but we can find events by the combination of shooter name and table row index as some rows have event names explicitly mentioned.\n\n3. Once we find a row for Yin Wen, check if the \"rank points\" or \"score points\" column(s) contain the value \"defending champion\". If it does, that means she was indeed the defending champion in that particular event and fulfills our qualification criterion.\n\n4. Relevant cells:\n   - If we find a row for Yin Wen containing the value \"defending champion\" in either the \"rank points\", \"score points\", or \"total\" columns, then these are the relevant cells.\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the steps for solving this problem:\n\n1. Identify all the rows that have the event as \"og beijing\". This is because the claim talks about the Olympic medalists, and we need to compare du li's ranking with those of other players at the Beijing Olympics.\n\n2. From the table, find du li's row index. In this case, du li's row index is 1.\n\n3. Find all the rows where the event is \"og beijing\" and assign them a temporary rank based on their position in the table (1 for first, 2 for second, etc.). In this case, the ranks are as follows:\n   - yin wen ( chn ): 1 (defending champion)\n   - du li ( chn ): 2 (olympic gold medalist)\n   - kate\u0159ina emmons ( cze ): 3 (olympic silver medalist)\n   - eglis yaima cruz ( cub ): 4 (olympic bronze medalist)\n\n4. Observe that there is no other player with the \"olympic bronze medalist\" rank point in the table, and du li has this rank. Therefore, du li is the only player who has the Olympic bronze medalist rank point among all the other players at the Beijing Olympics.\n\n5. To confirm our answer, we check if du li's row index (2) is equal to any other row index with the \"olympic bronze medalist\" rank point.
