The value 'loss' suggests a loss for the Black Knights on that date.\n4. Examine the 'record' column of the same row (row_index = 3) to determine the previous record before the game.

Compare the new record with the old record, and check if the number of losses has increased by one after the September 27th game.

Check the result: Look at the \"result\" column of the found row to verify the outcome of the game between the Black Knights and Stanford. The result in this row is \"loss\".\n4. Check the scores: If the game was a loss, we need to ensure that the score shown in the claim matches the difference between the points scored by the opponents (Stanford) and the Black Knights. In the table, for the game against Stanford, the number of points scored by the opponents is 67, while the number of black knights' points is 14.

The fifth row of the table (index 4) shows a loss by the Black Knights against Villanova, which doesn't match the claim as it should be Penn State in this case. However, the sixth row (index 5) shows a loss by the Black Knights against Pittsburgh with a record of 2 - 1.\n3. Then, I checked if the opponent that lost to the Black Knights on September 27th has a record of 2 - 1. In this case, Pittsburgh does have a record of 2 wins and 1 loss as per the table.\n4. Finally, I compared the information obtained in steps 2 and 3 with the claim. The claim states that the Black Knights lose to Penn State on September 27th, but our analysis showed that they lost to Pittsburgh instead.
