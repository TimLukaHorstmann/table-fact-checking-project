Find the relevant data about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri in the table:\n   - Row index: 3 (since he is listed as the third person in the table)\n   - Column names: \"born - died\", \"name\" and \"born - died\" should be compared since they contain the lifespan of each individual.\n\n3. Compare the \"born - died\" values for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri and other individuals listed in the table.\n   - For Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri, the \"born - died\" value is 1872 - 1963.\n   - The oldest person by their given lifespan in the table is Kostaq Kota (1st time), who was born in 1889 and died in 1949. However, note that this individual was not a prime minister during the specified period of 1928-1939.\n   - The other individuals listed in the table, Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time) and Kostaq Kota (2nd time), were born after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1859 for Pandeli Evangjeli and 1889 for Kostaq Kota).\n\n4. Analyze the context of the claim: The claim specifies that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived to be the oldest prime minister, so it should only consider individuals who were prime ministers during the specified period of 1928-1939. In this table, only the first row does not have a specific individual associated with it, suggesting it refers to the time period as a whole rather than an individual.\n\n5. Evaluate the claim based on the available data: Since there is no other prime minister listed during 1928-1939 who lived longer than Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1872 - 1963), the claim can be considered TRUE within the given table.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the relevant data about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri in the table\",\n    \"Compare the 'born - died' values for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri and other individuals listed in the table\",\n    \"Analyze the context of the claim\",\n    \"Evaluate the claim based on the available data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"born - died\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Determine the definition of a \"prime minister\": From the table, we can see that a prime minister is defined by the row labeled as \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\". Since this row does not provide individual names or terms, it cannot be compared with the other rows to determine whether they are prime ministers.\n3. Check each row individually:\n   - For the first row (labeled as \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\"), since it does not have individual names, we cannot compare it with the other rows.\n   - For the remaining rows, check if the \"political party\" column has a value of \"non - party\".\n4. Compare each row to the claim:\n   - Kostaq kota (1st time) and Kostaq kota (2nd time) have \"non - party\" in the political party column, so they meet the requirement for the claim.\n   - Pandeli evangjeli (2nd time) also has \"non - party\" in the political party column, meeting the claim's requirements.\n   - Mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time) and prime ministers 1928 - 1939 do not have a value for the \"political party\" column, but since they are labeled as prime ministers, it is reasonable to assume that they also meet the claim's requirements.\n5.
