Extract the relevant data from the table: Look for the rows where the 'appointed by' column equals 'sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n'. This will give us a list of all judges appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n3. Check if there is a row where the 'rank' equals 'chief justice': If there exists a row where the judge has the rank 'chief justice', then Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n indeed appointed the chief justice.\n4. Output the final answer: Based on the findings, determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE and return it in the requested JSON format.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\" }, // federico hern\u00e1ndez denton's rank\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Extract relevant data from the table\",\n    \"Check if there is a row where the 'rank' equals 'chief justice'\",\n    \"Output the final answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\" }\n  ]\n}",
