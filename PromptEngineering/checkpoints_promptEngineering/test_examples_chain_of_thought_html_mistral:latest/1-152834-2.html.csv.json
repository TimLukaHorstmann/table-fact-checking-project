This information is not provided directly but we can calculate it indirectly by summing up all Tujia populations listed for each administrative area and then extrapolating this value to represent the entire country since the table only lists a few selected areas.\n2. Second, we need to find the Tujia population of the \"Hunan\", \"Zhangjiajie\" and \"Wulingyuan\" region, which is 41910 as per the table.\n3. Third, compare the calculated Tujia population for China with the given population (41910) of \"Hunan\", \"Zhangjiajie\" and \"Wulingyuan\" area to determine if it's a valid percentage (0.52%) of China's Tujia population.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Sum up the Tujia populations for all areas listed in the table and treat this sum as an approximation for China's Tujia population.\",\n    \"Step 2: Find the Tujia population of 'Hunan', 'Zhangjiajie' and 'Wulingyuan' area from the given table which is 41910.\",\n    \"Step 3: Compare this value (41910) with an estimate for China's total Tujia population to determine if it constitutes 0.52% of the total.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Tujia\" }, // first cell of each row (Tujia population)\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Tujia\" }  // the row corresponding to Hunan, Zhangjiajie and Wulingyuan\n  ]\n}",

Since we cannot find any relevant data for Lichuan in the provided table, it cannot be directly compared to other areas.\n\n4.
