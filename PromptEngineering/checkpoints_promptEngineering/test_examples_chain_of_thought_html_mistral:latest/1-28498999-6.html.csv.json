Extract the points for each player from the \"points\" column of the table corresponding to the identified rows (rows 1 and 2). For Matt Kuchar, this is 4935 and for Dustin Johnson, it's 4299.\n\n3. Calculate the average by summing up the points for both players and then dividing by 2. In this case, the total points would be (4935 + 4299) = 9234 and the average would be 9234 / 2 = 4617.\n\n4.
