    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, I identify the specific criteria mentioned in the claim: 7 games, 4 losses, 19-19 point differential, and 6 points.\n2. Next, I search for rows in the table that match the number of games (7) and the number of losses (4). No such row is found as all losses are either 0, 1, 2 or 3. Therefore, there is no row in the table that has 7 games and 4 losses.\n3. Since there is no row with the specified number of games and losses, it means that there is no row that meets the criteria for a 7 game match with 4 losses, 19-19 point differential, and 6 points. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the specific criteria in the claim (number of games, number of losses, point differential, and points), Search for rows that match the specified criteria, No such row found, Conclude that there is no row that meets the specified criteria\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
