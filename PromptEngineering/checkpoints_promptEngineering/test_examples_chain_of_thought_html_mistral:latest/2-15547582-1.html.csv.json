    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim. The claim states that there should be no industrial and commercial panel members who have a labor panel greater than 1, a nomination by the taoiseach less than 11, and a cultural and educational panel smaller than 0.\n\n2. Next, we identify the relevant columns for our analysis: labor panel, nominated by the taoiseach, and cultural and educational panel. The row indices of interest are those where the party affiliation is either industrial or commercial (rows with party names containing \"industrial\" or \"commercial\").\n\n3. We then examine each row that meets the specified criteria (industrial or commercial parties) to verify if a member fits the conditions: labor panel greater than 1, nominated by the taoiseach less than 11, and cultural and educational panel smaller than 0.\n\n4. If we find such a member during our inspection of the table, then the claim is FALSE. If we do not find any members that fit these conditions, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim\",\n    \"Identify relevant columns (labor panel, nominated by the taoiseach, and cultural and educational panel)\",\n    \"Identify rows of interest (industrial or commercial parties)\",\n    \"Inspect each row to verify if a member fits the conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"labor panel\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\" },\n    // Relevant cells for all rows with party names containing \"industrial\" or \"commercial\"\n  ]\n}",
