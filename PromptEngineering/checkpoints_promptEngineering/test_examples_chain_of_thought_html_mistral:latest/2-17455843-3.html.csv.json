From the table, there are two such games: the first one involving teams nelson and York City, and the second one involving Coventry City and Exeter City.\n\n2. Check the score of the original game (the game before the replay) for both these matches. For the first match, the home team Nelson tied with York City, so the score was not in favor of Nelson. For the second match, Coventry City tied with Exeter City, so the score was also not in favor of Coventry City.\n\n3. Check the score of the replay for both these matches. There are no scores given for replays in the table. However, we can observe that there is a new row added for each replay with the \"tie no\" column having the value \"replay\", and the roles of home team and away team have been reversed compared to the original game. For example, in the first match, York City was the home team in the original game but is now the away team in the replay.\n\n4. In a replay, the roles of home team and away team are reversed. Therefore, in the replays, the teams that were away teams in the original games will have the opportunity to score more goals at home, thus potentially winning the game. However, there are no scores given for replays in this table, so it's impossible to determine whether the home teams won the replays based on this information alone.\n\n   Since we cannot definitively say that both replayed games were ultimately won by the home team due to lack of score data for the replays, the claim is not true.\n\n   Here is the output in JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify games with a replay, check scores of original games, observe roles reversed in replays, can't determine winners of replays due to lack of score data\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}\n     ]\n   }",
