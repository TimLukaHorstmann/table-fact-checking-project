Compare the found points against the required number of points for the claim: Since the claim states that Ensign Racing earned points in 3 years during the 6-year run on Goodyear tires, compare the number of years they earned points with the total number of Goodyear tire years (3 vs 6).\n\n6. Output the final answer based on the comparison: If there are at least 3 years where Ensign Racing earned points during the 6-year run on Goodyear tires, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE. In this case, since we found that Ensign Racing earned points in 3 of the 6 years with Goodyear tires (1975, 1977, and 1978), the claim is TRUE.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify key terms: 6 year run on Goodyear, Ensign Racing points in these years.\", \"Check for gaps or inconsistencies in the table.\", \"Extract relevant data based on tire brand.\", \"Check if Ensign Racing earned points in the relevant years.\", \"Compare found points against required number of points.\", \"Output final answer based on comparison\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
