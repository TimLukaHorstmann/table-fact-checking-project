The coach was Paul S McBrayer for the years 1953, 1959, and 1961. There is no record of a year 1964 in this table.\n2. Since the claim asks for years when Coach McBrayer coached the Ohio Valley Conference, we only need to check the years 1953, 1959, and 1961 (as we found these years in step 1).\n3. Check each of the respective rows in the table to see if they match the conference and coach specified in the claim. For row 0 (1953), the coach is McBrayer and the conference is Ohio Valley, so it matches. For row 2 (1961), the coach is McBrayer and the conference is Ohio Valley, so it matches. There is no row for year 1959 in this table, but since we know that Coach McBrayer was coaching the Ohio Valley Conference in 1959 from step 1, we can infer that the table does not have a complete record for all years.\n4.
