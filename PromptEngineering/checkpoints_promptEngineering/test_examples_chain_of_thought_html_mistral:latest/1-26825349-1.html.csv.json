From the table, we don't see any story titles that exactly match \"the con man in the meth lab\".\n2. However, one of the titles, \"the con artist in the lab\", seems to be similar. We can infer that if there was a story titled \"the con man in the meth lab\", it would likely be very similar or identical to \"the con artist in the lab\".\n3. Check where \"the con artist in the lab\" is listed in the table, specifically in the Season column (column 'A'). The row index of this title is 48 (last row).\n4. Given that there is no exact match for \"the con man in the meth lab\", but it appears to be similar and located in a similar position as \"the con artist in the lab\", we can infer that if \"the con man in the meth lab\" existed, it would likely also be in the Season 9 (column 'A').\n5. Since we are looking for the number in the Season column as 9.0 and the number in the Season column for \"the con artist in the lab\" is 9, we can infer that if there was a story titled \"the con man in the meth lab\", it would also be in Season 9 (column 'A').\n6. To confirm our conclusion, we check if there are any titles in Season 9 (column 'A') with different numbers, but there aren't.
