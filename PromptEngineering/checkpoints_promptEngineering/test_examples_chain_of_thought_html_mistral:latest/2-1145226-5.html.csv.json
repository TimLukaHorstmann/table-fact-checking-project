Identify relevant columns: Since we are looking for the highest count of drop kicks, we only need to look at the \"tries\" column which contains the total number of tries (including drop kicks).

Compare the span length of all players in the table and find out if there's any player with a shorter span than Riaan van Zyl. - The span for each player is: Vaea Anitoni (1992 - 2000, 9 years), Paul Emerick (2003 - 2012, 9 years), Todd Clever (2003 -, not known, but >4 years), Philip Eloff (2000 - 2007, 8 years), Takudzwa Ngwenya (2007 -, not known, but >4 years), Chris Wyles (2007 -, not known, but >4 years), David Fee (2002 - 2005, 4 years), Mike Hercus (2002 - 2009, 8 years). Comparing the span with Riaan van Zyl's 4-year span, we find that David Fee has the shortest span.
