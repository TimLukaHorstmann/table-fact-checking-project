This means Italy has received 2 (Italy's gold) - 0 (Canada's gold) = 2 more gold medals than Canada.\n2. Check if Italy ties with either the United States or West Germany in terms of total gold medals. To do this, find their respective 'gold' column values and compare them to Italy's. The United States and West Germany have both received 2 gold medals, which is equal to Italy's count, hence they tie with Italy.\n3. To confirm the claim that \"italy receive 3 more gold medal than canada do but tie with the united state and west germany\", we need to find another factor to compare and ensure it results in a tie. Since the number of silver medals is the next most relevant factor, let's check if any of these three nations have equal numbers of silver medals. For Italy, the silver count is 1, for the United States, it is 1, and for West Germany, it is 4 (which is not equal to Italy or the US). Thus, based on silver medal counts, they do not tie with each other in this aspect.\n4. However, since the claim mentions tying with the United States and West Germany specifically in gold medals, we can safely conclude that the information provided in the table is enough to verify the claim.
