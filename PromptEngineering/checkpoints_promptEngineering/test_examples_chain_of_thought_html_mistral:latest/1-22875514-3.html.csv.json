    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify the player: The claim is about the player named 'cole'.\n2. Find the row of the player: In the table, look for the row where the 'player' column value is 'cole'. The row index corresponding to 'cole' is 38.\n3. Extract field goal data for the player: Find the data in the same row under the 'field goals' column. It should contain the number of made and missed field goals, separated by dashes (18 - 50).\n4. Calculate the average: To calculate the average, we need to find the sum of the made and missed shots, and then divide it by the total number of attempts (made + missed). Here, the sum of '18' and '50' is '68'. So, the average is '68 / 2 = 34'.\n5. Compare with the claim: The claim states that 'cole have 18 out of 50 field goal for a 360 average'. However, our calculation shows that the average is '34', not '360'.\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player\",\n    \"Find the row of the player\",\n    \"Extract field goal data for the player\",\n    \"Calculate the average\",\n    \"Compare with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 38,\n      \"column_name\": \"field goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the player for whom we need to check the field goal data. In this case, it's player \"cole\".\n2. Locate the row in the table corresponding to player \"cole\". The rows in the table have the \"player\" as their first column, so we find the row where the first cell is \"cole\".\n3. Check the second column (field goals) of the identified row for the data related to our claim.\n4. Compare the data in the second column with the field goal given in the claim, i.e., compare \"18\" from the claim with \"18\" in the table.\n5. If both numbers match exactly, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n   Here's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player to check field goals: 'cole', Locate row for 'cole': find the row where first cell is 'cole', Check second column (field goals) of identified row with given claim value\", \"Compare numbers in table and claim: compare '18' from claim with '18' from table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"Field goals\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the player whose record we are looking for, which in this case is 'cole'.\n2. Look for the row in the table where the 'player' column matches 'cole'.\n3. The relevant cell for field goals for 'cole' is in the fourth row and first column of the 'points' section (which is the sum of made field goals, missed field goals, and total attempts). In this case, it is '18 - 50 360'.\n4. The made field goals for 'cole' can be found by subtracting the missed field goals from the total field goal attempts. So '50 - 18 = 32'.\n5. The number '18' in the cell represents the number of missed field goals, and '360' is the total number of attempts.\n6. Comparing the claim 'cole player have 6 - 19 316 field goal' to our findings from step 5, we can see that it is not correct as the made field goals are 32, not 6.
