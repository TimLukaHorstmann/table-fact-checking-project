In the table, find the row where 'The Racer's Group' is '67 the racer's group'.\n3. Look at the column 'Fastest Lap Time' to see if it is the fastest among all groups in that round.\n4. Compare this with the Fastest Lap Time of other groups in Row 3.\n5. If '67 the racer's group' has the same Fastest Lap Time as the rest, then it is not the fastest lap time for that round and thus not the first round they were the fastest.\n6. If '67 the racer's group' has a faster Fastest Lap Time than the rest in Row 3, then it is the fastest lap time for that round and could potentially be the first round they were the fastest.\n7. To confirm, we need to check if there are any earlier rounds where '67 the racer's group' had an even faster Fastest Lap Time.\n8. If no earlier rows with faster lap times are found, then it is reasonable to claim that this could be the first round they were the fastest.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Group\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Fastest Lap Time\"}]",
