To identify the team, I will look at the \"opponent\" column and find rows where the opponent is the Dallas Cowboys (since they are playing against themselves, they won't appear in this table).\n3. Since the Dallas Cowboys don't have any matches in this table, I cannot determine their win-loss record directly from the provided data. However, since all the results for other teams show losses, it suggests that if there were games involving the Cowboys, they would also likely be losses.\n4. As a final step, I will check the sum of wins and losses to confirm my hypothesis. Since the total count of wins (counting only matches where \"result\" contains 'w') is 5, while the total count of losses (counting all rows) is 16, it indicates that the Dallas Cowboys likely had more losses than wins in the 2001 season.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check each row for the team 'Dallas Cowboys', since they won't appear in this table we infer their matches from the results of opponents, Summarize win and loss counts\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
