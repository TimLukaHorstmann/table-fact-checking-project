Identify the event (race) we need to analyze: The given table is about the results of the 1998 Monaco Grand Prix, so we will focus on this race.\n\n2. Find all drivers who retired due to suspension issues: Scan through the \"time / retired\" column and look for rows where the value does not represent a time but rather a description (e.g., \"+ x laps\", \"gearbox\", \"wheel\", etc.). Drivers with these descriptions are those who retired due to issues other than running out of time. Among them, we will find drivers who were forced to retire due to suspension issues.\n\n3. Count the number of drivers who retired due to suspension issues: Once we have identified the drivers who retired due to suspension issues, count their number and compare it with the total number of drivers in the table (75).\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the event by examining the table title and column headers\",\n    \"Find drivers who retired due to suspension issues by scanning through the 'time / retired' column for descriptions instead of times\",\n    \"Count the number of drivers who retired due to suspension issues\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" }\n  ]\n}",

Find out if any of these constructors have more than one driver who completed the race. The \"retired\" column indicates whether a driver retired or finished the race (if it's a time, they finished; otherwise, they did not). For simplicity, we will consider drivers with a time as having finished the race.\n3. To determine if a constructor has more than one finisher, compare the number of rows corresponding to each constructor that have times in the \"time / retired\" column. If there are two or more such rows for any constructor, then that constructor has more than one finisher.\n4. If no constructor has more than one finisher, it means that only one constructor has a car finish the race (since all cars started the race), and the claim is true. If there is at least one constructor with more than one finisher, it would mean that more than one constructor have cars finish the race, and the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for this problem are:\n- All rows in the table where \"time / retired\" column has a time (i.e., drivers who finished the race)\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all constructor names\",\n    \"Find constructors with more than one finisher by comparing rows with times\",\n    \"If no constructor has more than one finisher, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time/retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time/retired\" },\n    ...

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the 'laps' column value is 78, which means these drivers completed the full race distance of 78 laps.\n\n2. Check each driver's name to see if they appear more than once in the table (since a driver might have different cars or teammates during the season). However, this table only lists each driver once.\n\n3. Since all rows with 'laps' equal to 78 are unique and there are no repeating drivers, we can assume these are the drivers who completed 78 laps.\n\n4. Count the number of such drivers by simply looking at the rows that match our condition.\n\n5. Compare this count against the total number of drivers given in the claim (6).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the final answer can be represented as:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify rows where 'laps' is 78 and check for repeated drivers.
