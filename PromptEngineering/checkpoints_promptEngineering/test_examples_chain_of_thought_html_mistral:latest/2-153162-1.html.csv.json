Identify the claim: The claim states that all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airline are incorporated in Malaysia, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is incorporated in India.\n\n2. Determine the basis for comparison: To validate the claim, we will compare each company's 'incorporated in' column with the companies labeled as subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines.\n\n3. Iterate through the table: Go through each row in the table to check the company type and incorporation location.\n\n4. Check for subsidiaries incorporated in Malaysia: All the companies labeled as 'subsidiary' are listed in the table, and their incorporation location is Malaysia. This includes Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd, Maswings Sdn Bhd, Firefly Sdn Bhd, MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd, Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd, MAS Academy Sdn Bhd, and Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.\n\n5. Check for associates incorporated in Malaysia: There is only one company labeled as 'associate' that is not explicitly listed in the claim - LSG Sky Chefs. However, since the claim does not mention holding companies or any other type of entity, we can disregard this case as it doesn't affect our assessment of the claim.\n\n6. Check for associates incorporated outside Malaysia: The only company labeled as 'associate' that is incorporated outside Malaysia is Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\n\n7. Compare findings with the claim: All the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines are indeed incorporated in Malaysia, and there is one associate (Taj Madras Air Catering Limited) that is incorporated outside Malaysia.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify all the companies listed in the table, group them into subsidiaries and associates based on their type (subsidiary or associate).\n    - Subsidiaries: Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd, Ge Engine Services Malaysia, Maswings Sdn Bhd, Firefly Sdn Bhd, MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd, Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd, MAS Academy Sdn Bhd, Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\n    - Associates: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, LSG Sky Chefs.\n\n2. Check for any associates that have 30% equity shareholding. Since there are no rows where the \"group's equity shareholding\" column is equal to \"30%\" and the company type is an associate, it follows that all associates have less than 30% equity shareholding.\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the companies in the table and classify them as subsidiaries or associates based on their type.\",\n    \"Check if there are any associate companies with 30% equity shareholding by looking at the 'group's equity shareholding' column for associate rows.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
