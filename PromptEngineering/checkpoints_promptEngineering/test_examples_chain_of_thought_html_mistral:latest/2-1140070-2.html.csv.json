    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the claim, which states that McLaren-Tag is the constructor of the car for the race where Nigel Mansell ran the fastest lap.\n2. To verify the claim, we need to find two things: a) the races in which Nigel Mansell participated and b) the constructors for those races.\n3. Scan the table to find all rows with Nigel Mansell's name in the 'Race' column (this can be achieved by looking for \"Nigel mansell\" in any row, ignoring case sensitivity).\n4. In the rows where Nigel Mansell is listed as the driver, identify the constructor by looking at the value in the 'Constructor' column.\n5. For each race of Nigel Mansell, check if McLaren-Tag appears as the constructor. If it does, then we have a match for the claim.\n6. If McLaren-Tag is the constructor for any race where Nigel Mansell ran the fastest lap, return a JSON object with the following structure:\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify races of Nigel Mansell, find constructors for those races, check if McLaren-Tag appears as constructor for any race where Nigel Mansell ran fastest lap\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": row_index1, \"column_name\": \"Race\" },\n    { \"row_index\": row_index1, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\" }\n    // ... add more rows if necessary\n  ]\n}\n```\nWhere `row_index1`, `row_index2`, etc. are the row indices of the rows that contain Nigel Mansell's races and their constructors, respectively.\n\nAfter checking the table, I found three relevant races:\n- German Grand Prix: McLaren-Tag was the constructor\n- Italian Grand Prix: McLaren-Tag was not the constructor (Ferrari was)\n- Australian Grand Prix: McLaren-Tag was the constructor\n\nSo, the JSON output would be:\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify races of Nigel Mansell, find constructors for those races, check if McLaren-Tag appears as constructor for any race where Nigel Mansell ran fastest lap\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Race\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"Race\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
