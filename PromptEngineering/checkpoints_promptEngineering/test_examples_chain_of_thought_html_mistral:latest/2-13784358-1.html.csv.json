    "resp": "1. Identify the structure of the table, which contains a list of buildings sorted by their heights. Each row provides information about a specific building including its name, height, and year built.\n\n2. In order to determine whether it is true or false that \"the year 1989 with symphony tower hold the rank of 2\", we need to find out if there exists a building named \"Symphony Tower\" in the table and compare its position (rank) relative to all other buildings based on their heights.\n\n3. Search through the table for a row containing the name \"Symphony Tower\". In this specific table, there is no row with that exact name. However, we can find a building named \"Marriott Hotel & Marina Tower I\" and \"Marriott Hotel & Marina Tower II\", which were built in 1987, and might be referred to as the Symphony Towers (as they share the same address).\n\n4. Compare the position of Marriott Hotel & Marina Tower I and II based on their row indexes to determine if it holds the rank of 2 or not.\n\n5. The table shows that Marriott Hotel & Marina Tower I has a row index of 68 (as it is the 68th row), while Marriott Hotel & Marina Tower II has a row index of 69 (as it is the 69th row). Since there are a total of 105 buildings listed in the table, the rank of both towers combined would be between 2 and 3.\n\n6. Final answer: The year 1987 with Marriott Hotel & Marina Tower I and II hold a rank that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than or equal to 3. However, we were asked to check for the year 1989 specifically, so it is not possible to definitively say whether \"the year 1989 with symphony tower hold the rank of 2\" based on this table alone (since there's no explicit information about a building named \"Symphony Tower\" in the given table).\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the structure and content of the table.\",\n    \"Determine if a 'Symphony Tower' exists in the table by looking for its name.\",\n    \"Investigate the position (rank) of the buildings based on their heights.\",\n    \"Compare the positions of Marriott Hotel & Marina Tower I and II.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 68,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 69,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

There are two such rows with index 21 and 43 (since there are two towers for Marriott Hotel and Marina Tower).\n\n3. Extract the number of floors: From each row, we will extract the value in the \"Floors\" column. For Meridian Condominiums, the values are 371 (row 21) and 371 (row 43).\n\n4. Compare the extracted values: Since both rows have the same number of floors for Meridian Condominiums, we can assume that all buildings with this name share the same number of floors.\n\n5.
