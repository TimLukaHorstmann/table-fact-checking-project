If there is such a row index, compare it to the index of the table header (\"week\") to ensure that the row contains all necessary data (i.e., the row index - 1 equals the index of the \"week\" column).\n4.

To find the relevant row index of the cell containing \"chicago bears\", iterate through each row using the table's rows collection and check if its opponent value is \"chicago bears\". Once you find it, store that row index for further use.\n7. Calculate the index of the \"week\" column by subtracting 1 from the row index containing \"chicago bears\", as the first cell in each row represents the week number and not the row index itself.\n8. Compare the calculated week index with the original row index of the \"chicago bears\" opponent to ensure that it's one less than the current row index, confirming that all necessary data is present in the row.\n9.
