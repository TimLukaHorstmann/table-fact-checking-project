    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that set 3 will be 25 - 13 when the total score is 75 - 34. This means we are looking for a row where set 3 matches 25 - 13 and the total score matches 75 - 34.\n\n2. Examine the table: The table provides data about different dates, scores, and sets (set 1, set 2, and set 3). Each date has multiple rows representing different games, and each game contains the score, all sets' scores, and the total score.\n\n3. Look for matching rows: We need to search through the table to find a row where both conditions of the claim are met (set 3 = 25 - 13 and total = 75 - 34).\n\n4. Find the relevant cells: The relevant cells would be those related to set 3 score and total score for the date that matches the corresponding set 3 score in our claim.
