No other competition's venue is specified as being in Italy.\n3. Check if there are any other competitions that might have been missed or mislabeled: Since all the rows of the table correspond to different years, it is unlikely that another Italian event is hidden in the data. Furthermore, the names of the competitions make it clear that they were not major international events like the Olympics or World Championships, which would be more likely to be repeated in Italy.\n4. Compare the findings with the claim: The claim states that there was only one competition held in Italy, and the table supports this statement since only the 2004 World Junior Championships are listed as taking place in Italy.
