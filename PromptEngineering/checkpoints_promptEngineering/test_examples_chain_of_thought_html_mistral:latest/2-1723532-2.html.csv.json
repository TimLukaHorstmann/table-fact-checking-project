I found no exact match, but Indian Wells often refers to the event held at Indian Wells, California, USA, known as the BNP Paribas Open. The closest matches I found were \"indian wells\" and \"BNP Paribas Open\", so I decided to check both of them in case there was a typo or variation in naming conventions.\n\n2. Next, I looked for all rows that contained either \"indian wells\" or \"BNP Paribas Open\" as the tournament name to see if any of them corresponded with the given date (8 March 1992).\n\n3. After examining all the rows containing \"indian wells\" and \"BNP Paribas Open\", I found no matches with the given date (8 March 1992).\n\n4. Since there was no match between the tournament name and the given date, I concluded that the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells in this case do not have specific row_index values since I did not find any matches.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the tournament name that corresponds to Indian Wells.\",\n    \"Check all rows for 'indian wells' and 'BNP Paribas Open', the potential names for Indian Wells.\",\n    \"Determine if any of these rows contain the date 8 March 1992.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
