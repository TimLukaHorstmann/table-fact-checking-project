We can count the number of rows that have \"colorado\" as the visitor by checking the second column (\"visitor\") of each row.\n\n3. If we find 7 or more rows where \"visitor\" equals \"Colorado\", it suggests there were at least 7 wins for Colorado in November. Additionally, if we can find 3 rows where the score shows a tie (i.e., a draw) with \"colorado\" as the visitor, then it would confirm that Colorado had 3 ties during this time span.\n\n4.

To verify if Colorado played 11 away games, we need to find out how many rows in this table have 'Colorado' as the 'visitor'. Rows where 'Colorado' is listed as the visitor represent away games for Colorado.\n\n3. In the table, there are 13 rows in total.
