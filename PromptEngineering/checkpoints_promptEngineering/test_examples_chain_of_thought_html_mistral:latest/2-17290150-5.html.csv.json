    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the players in question from the table, which are Harvie Ward (Row 1) and Jack Fleck (Rows 3 & 7).\n2. Determine their scores for each round, as per the 'score' column. For Harvie Ward, it is 74 + 70 = 144. For Jack Fleck, his scores are not immediately available in the table but can be found across multiple rows (76 + 69 = 145 for Rows 3 & 7).\n3. Compare their total scores after adjusting for par. The 'to par' column indicates that both players were 4 over par, so we need to add this value to their raw scores. So Harvie Ward's adjusted score is 144 + 4 = 148 and Jack Fleck's adjusted score is (76 + 69 from Rows 3 & 7) + 5 * 2 (since there are two rows for Jack Fleck, each with a 'to par' of 5) = 145 + 10 = 155.\n4. Compare the adjusted scores: Harvie Ward's score is 148 and Jack Fleck's score is 155. Since 148 < 155, it can be concluded that Harvie Ward ultimately scored one point less than Jack Fleck at the 1955 US Open.\n\n   Here is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify players Harvie Ward and Jack Fleck from the table, find their raw scores and adjust them for par, compare adjusted scores.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}",
