Locate the relevant fight data for \"Pancrase - Impressive Tour 9\" in the table. There are no specific rows labeled as \"Pancrase - Impressive Tour 9\", so we need to find fights that happened around that time or have a name that matches \"Impressive Tour 9\". The closest match is \"Pancrase - Brave 1\", which took place on June 2, 2016 and might be the start of an \"Impressive Tour\".\n3. Extract the record, win-loss-draw (WLD) count, and time for this event from the relevant row. Since we could not find an exact match for \"Pancrase - Impressive Tour 9\", we will use \"Pancrase - Brave 1\" as our reference.\n4. Extract the WLD count and time from the row: The WLD count for \"Pancrase - Brave 1\" is 3-2-2 (from columns 1, 2, and 3 respectively), and there's no time listed for this event specifically. However, as part of the same table, we can see that the win count is 3, and if we assume that each fight has a duration of about 5 minutes, the total duration for all fights in the table would be approximately (20 rows * 5 minutes =) 100 minutes.\n5. Compare the claim with the extracted information: The record for \"Pancrase - Brave 1\" is 3-2-2, which does not equal 19-9-4 as claimed. However, we cannot verify the time of 1:44 since there's no specific time mentioned for any event in this table.\n\nFinal answer: The claim is FALSE based on the WLD count comparison.
