    "resp": "1. Identify the team of interest: The claim asks about the attendance at San Diego Chargers' games before week 6.\n\n2. Locate the rows related to the team of interest: In the table, there are three rows where the opponent is the San Diego Chargers. They can be found in rows 3, 12, and 13.\n\n3. Check the weeks corresponding to each row: The weeks for these rows are week 3 (3rd row), week 12 (12th row), and week 13 (13th row).\n\n4. Determine if any of the relevant rows are before week 6: Week 6 corresponds to the 6th row in the table. Since the San Diego Chargers' game in week 3 is before week 6, we need to consider only that row for now (row 3). The other two rows (12 and 13) can be ignored since they are after week 6.\n\n5. Calculate the attendance for the relevant row: In the table, the attendance for the San Diego Chargers game in week 3 is 13000 (found in row 3, column \"attendance\").\n\n6. Compare the calculated attendance with the claim: The claim asks for the total attendance before week 6 at San Diego Charger games. Since we have already identified that the attendance for the San Diego Chargers game in week 3 (13000) is within this time frame, our answer can be found by checking if 13000 is included in the total attendance before week 6.\n\n7. Sum up the attendance of all games before row 6: To find the total attendance before week 6, we sum the attendance of all rows from the first to the fifth (since the San Diego Chargers game is in row 3). The sum is as follows: 12893 + 12500 + 42 + 33 + 7 = 32737.\n\n8. Compare the calculated total with the claim: We have calculated a total attendance of 32737 before week 6, and the claim asks if 13000 (the attendance at San Diego Chargers game in week 3) is included within that total. Since 13000 is less than or equal to 32737, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team of interest (San Diego Chargers), Locate the rows related to the team, Check the weeks corresponding to each row, Determine if any of the relevant rows are before week 6, Calculate the attendance for the relevant row, Compare the calculated attendance with the claim, Sum up the attendance of all games before row 6, Compare the calculated total with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",
