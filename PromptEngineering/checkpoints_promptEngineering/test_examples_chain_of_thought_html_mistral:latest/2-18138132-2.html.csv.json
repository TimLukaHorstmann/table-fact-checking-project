These will be useful for finding relevant information about the claim.\n\n2. Determine the claim's components: The claim consists of two parts - the app name (Windows Live Messenger) and the developer (Microsoft), version number (1.4), and category (social networking).\n\n3. Search the table row-wise for the app name, developer, and category that match the claim's components: Start from the first row and move down until we find a row where the 'title', 'developer', and 'category' values match the claim's components.\n\n4. Check if the found row contains the version number (1.4) as specified in the claim: If the version number matches, it means the software has been updated multiple times since its initial release and is now at version 1.4.\n\n5. Validate the year of the release date: Once we have confirmed that the found row meets all requirements from step 3 and step 4, check if the release date is within the year 2010 or later as specified in the claim.\n\n6. Compare the findings with the claim: If our search results match the details mentioned in the claim (Windows Live Messenger, version 1.4, social networking category, and released on or after 2010), then it confirms the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure\", \"Determine claim components\", \"Search for app name, developer, and category\", \"Check if found row contains version number\", \"Validate year of release date\", \"Compare findings with claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"developer\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"version\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
