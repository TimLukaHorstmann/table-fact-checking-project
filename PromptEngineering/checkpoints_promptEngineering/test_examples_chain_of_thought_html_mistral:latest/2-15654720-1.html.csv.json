    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the season to be checked: The claim states that we should check the season 2002 - 2003.\n2. Find the row corresponding to the identified season in the table: In this table, rows represent seasons and columns represent different statistics for each season. We need to find the row where the 'season' column has a value of \"2002 - 03\".\n3. Compare the values in the relevant columns with the given conditions in the claim: The claim states that there should be 6 cashes, a match play smaller than 13 and 7 events. We should compare these conditions with the values in the 'cashes', 'match play' and 'events' columns for the row identified in step 2.\n4. Check if all the conditions are met: If all the conditions (6 cashes, a match play smaller than 13 and 7 events) are satisfied by the values in the relevant columns for the identified row, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the season to be checked.\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the identified season in the table.\",\n    \"Compare the values in the relevant columns with the given conditions in the claim.\",\n    \"Check if all the conditions are met\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"match play\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\" }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the relevant columns from the table, which are 'cashes' (to find out how many cash events there are) and 'earnings' (to verify if any of them have earnings of 39380).\n2. Traverse through each row in the table (from row 1 to the last row), and for each row:\n   - Check the value at the 'cashes' column, if it equals 6. If yes, then proceed to the next step.
