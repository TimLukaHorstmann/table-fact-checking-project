Examine the column named 'lyrics (l) / music (m)' for the identified row. This column indicates who wrote the lyrics and music for each song. In this case, 'mats lie sk\u00e5re' is mentioned in the cell, which suggests that they wrote both the lyrics and music for the song \"left / right\".\n\n4. Compare the information obtained against the claim to be verified. The claim states that 'mat lie sk\u00e5re' wrote the lyrics and music for the song \"left / right\".
