This can be done by counting the rows where the 'week' column has a value (ignoring row 3, as it is not part of the sequence). The sequence starts from row 5 and ends at row 18. So there are 14 weeks listed.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out if there are any weeks where no game is played for the Minnesota Vikings. To do this, we look for rows in the table that have a 'week' value but no corresponding 'result'. If we find such a row, it would mean that no game was played during that week.\n\n3. Upon inspection of the table, there are no empty 'result' cells corresponding to any 'week' values from 1 to 18.\n\n4. Since all weeks listed in the table have a corresponding result, we can conclude that the claim \"during the 1993 Minnesota Vikings season there be 2 weeks in which the team does not play\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis are not applicable as no empty 'result' cell was found.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of weeks listed\",\n    \"Check if there are any weeks where no game is played\",\n    \"Inspect the table for empty 'result' cells\",\n    \"Conclude based on the findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

In this table, we can identify rows where the opponent is Tampa Bay Buccaneers (row 6 and row 12) and Chicago Bears (row 2 and row 8), as these were the teams against which the Vikings held their opponents to zero points.\n\n3. Narrow down the relevant rows to those where the Minnesota Vikings won and their opponent scored zero points, i.e., find rows with a result of \"w\" and an empty string or a number that can be interpreted as 0 (in this case, both conditions are satisfied by strings containing only digits). The relevant rows in this table for our claim would be rows 6 and 12.\n\n4. Finally, determine if there are two weeks where the Minnesota Vikings held their opponents to zero points.
