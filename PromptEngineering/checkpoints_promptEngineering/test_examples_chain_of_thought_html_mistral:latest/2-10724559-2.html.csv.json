Locate the row corresponding to Diego Milito in the table: To do this, we look for the name \"diego milito\" under the 'name' column. The relevant row index is 7.\n\n3. Verify the debut year: Check the 'debut year' column for the row corresponding to Diego Milito. If it matches 2008, then the claim about his debut year is correct. In this case, it does match, so we move on to the next step.\n\n4. Verify the goal count: Check the 'goals' column for the row corresponding to Diego Milito. If it matches 86 goals, then the claim about his goal count is correct. However, in this table, there are two players with index 7 and 8 who both have 86 goals. To find out which one is Diego Milito, we need additional information such as their current club or another distinguishing factor. If we assume that one of them is indeed Diego Milito, then the claim about his goal count would be correct for this specific table (but it wouldn't be definite unless we know which one is Diego Milito).\n\nGiven that there are two players with 86 goals at row index 7 and 8, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim based on the provided table.
