Identify the claim to be verified: The claim is \"blueeyesintherein won on 2012, with the owner being self, king morgenson, travis, and so on.\"\n\n2.

Check if any of the owners mentioned in the claim (self, king morgenson, travis) exist among the extracted owner details.

Identify the table's structure: The table contains data about various horse races from different years, including details such as year, winner, jockey, trainer, owner, and time.\n2. Find the relevant row: Look for the row where the \"year\" column contains the value \"2012\". This corresponds to the 1st row in the table.\n3. Check the owner's name: Examine the cell in the 1st row under the \"owner\" column. The value here is \"self / king / morgenson / travis , and et al\".\n4. Confirm the winner: Look at the cell in the 1st row under the \"winner\" column. The value here is \"blueeyesintherein\".\n5. Compare both findings: Since we found that the owner's name for the year \"2012\" and the horse that won that year, \"blueeyesintherein\", match the provided owner name, it can be inferred that the claim is true.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure\", \"Find relevant row (year = 2012)\", \"Check owner's name\", \"Confirm winner\", \"Compare both findings\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, I need to find the row that corresponds to flashy lassie in the table. The winner column gives the name of each horse. So, I will look for the row where the 'winner' value is \"flashy lassie\". This row has an index of 1 (the first row with a 'winner' value of \"flashy lassie\" is row 2).\n2. Next, I need to find out who the owner was for flashy lassie based on the 'owner' column in that same row. In this case, the owner is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\".\n3. Now, I will compare this information with the claim to see if it matches. The claim states that \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et all own winner flashy lassie after 2009\".
