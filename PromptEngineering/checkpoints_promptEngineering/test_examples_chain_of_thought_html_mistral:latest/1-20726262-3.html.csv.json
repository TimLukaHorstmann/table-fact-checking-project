To do this, I will look for a pattern or consistency in the values of these two columns across rows.\n\n2. I observe that each row has a production code that starts with '2wab' followed by some numbers. This suggests that the production code is related to the series number and not the season number.\n\n3. To find out if there is a relationship between the production code and the season number, I need to identify another column that corresponds to the season number. In this table, the \"no in season\" column seems to be a possible candidate for the season number.\n\n4. Examining the values in the \"no in season\" column, it appears that they increase by 1 for each subsequent row, indicating that this column could indeed represent the season number.\n\n5. Now, I need to check if there is any pattern or consistency in the relationship between the production code and the \"no in season\" column. However, there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern that links these two columns together.\n\n6.

Identify the columns in the table: no in series, no in season, title, directedby, writtenby, originalairdate, production code, usviewers (million).\n2.

To verify this, we need to find the row where the production code matches \"2wab10\" and check the corresponding cell for the season number.\n3. Scan through the table to locate the row with production code \"2wab10\".

The relevant cells are:\n    - Row index 10, column name \"no in season\": n / a (not directly helpful since the season number is not available)\n    - However, since the no in series increases sequentially, and the current value is 20, if we add 12 to it, we get 32.
