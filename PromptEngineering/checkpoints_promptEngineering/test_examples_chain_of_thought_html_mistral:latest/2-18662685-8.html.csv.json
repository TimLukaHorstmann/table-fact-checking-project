    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that rank 4 is lower than 6:40.02.\n\n2. Identify the table structure: We have a table with columns \"rank\", \"rowers\", \"country\", \"time\", and \"notes\". The rows contain data about each rower/team, including their rank, names, country, time (in minutes and seconds), and any notes.\n\n3. Find the relevant row for rank 4: In the table, we can see that rank 4 corresponds to the row where \"rank\" is 4. The team in this row consists of \"zsolt hirling\" and \"tam\u00e3\u00a1s varga\", representing Hungary with a time of 6:50.48.\n\n4. Compare the found time (6:50.48) to the claim's threshold (6:40.02): To compare the times, we add the number of seconds in each time together. The Hungarian team's total time is 6 minutes * 60 seconds + 50.48 seconds = 390.48 seconds. The claim's threshold is 6:40.02, which translates to 400.02 seconds.\n\n5. Make the comparison: The Hungarian team's time (390.48 seconds) is greater than the claim's threshold (400.02 seconds).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and table structure\",\n    \"Find the relevant row for rank 4\",\n    \"Compare the found time to the claim's threshold\",\n    \"Make the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\" }\n  ]\n}",
