Scan through the table to find a row where the home team score matches the given value (5.12 or 42 in points, 12 or 42 in goals). In this case, we have multiple rows with a home team score of 42 points and 12 goals, but the relevant row is the first one since all other rows have different home teams.\n\n3. Verify that the away team score in the identified row matches the given value (3.8 or 26 in points, 8 or 26 in goals). In this case, the away team score in the identified row is \"3.8 (26)\".\n\n4.
