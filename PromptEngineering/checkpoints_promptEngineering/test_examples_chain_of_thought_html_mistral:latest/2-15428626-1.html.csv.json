If the opponent team for a particular game is not \"houston oilers\", then the game on October 27, 1963 cannot be against the Houston Oilers.\n3. Iterate through each row in the table to check the opponent column for matches with \"houston oilers\".\n4. In this case, we find that the opponent on row 11 (index 10) is \"houston oilers\". The date for this game is October 1, 1963 which is not equal to October 27, 1963.\n5. Since no other game's opponent matches \"houston oilers\" and the date does not match October 27, 1963 for any game in the table, we can conclude that October 27, 1963 was not the date of a game against the Houston Oilers.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify opponent teams in the table\",\n    \"Check if opponent for any game is 'houston oilers'\",\n    \"Iterate through each row to find matches with 'houston oilers'\",\n    \"Compare dates for games where opponent matches 'houston oilers'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
