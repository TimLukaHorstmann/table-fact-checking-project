    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to find the row where the date matches the one mentioned in the claim (7 January 2003). We can do this by iterating through each row in the table and checking if the \"date\" cell matches the given date.\n\n2. Once we have found the matching row, we can check the value of the \"round\" column for that specific row to see if it corresponds to a semi-final first leg game (as stated in the claim).\n\n3. If the round is indeed 'semi-final first leg', then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWith this reasoning process in mind, let's output the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row where the date matches the given date (7 January 2003).\", \"Check if the 'round' column for that specific row corresponds to a semi-final first leg game.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
