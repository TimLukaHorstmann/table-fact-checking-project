Create a list to store the starts for each engine: Initialize an empty list to store the start values for each engine.\n3. Iterate through the rows: Loop through each row in the table, starting from the second row (since the first row is the header) and ending when all rows are processed.\n4. Check the engine type for each row: For each row, check the third column to get the engine type.\n5. Add the start value for the current engine: If the engine type matches a previously unseen engine type, add the start value from the fourth column to a new entry in the list with the key as the engine type and the value as the start value. If the engine type is already in the list, simply increment the corresponding start value.\n6. Check for most starts: After processing all rows, compare the values in the list to find the maximum value. This will be the number of starts for the engine with the most starts.\n7. Find the engine with the most starts: Look up the engine type that corresponds to the maximum start count in the list created earlier.\n8. Compare the results: If the engine type found in step 7 is \"oldsmobile\", then the claim is TRUE.

Extract the unique teams from the table: {team: ['simon', 'shierson', 'truesports', 'rahal / hogan', 'mccormack', 'brant', 'treadway']}\n\n4. Iterate through each unique team and check their number of finishes:\n   - For each team, count the number of instances where the finish column is less than 10 for that team.\n   - If a team has more than one row with less than 10 finishes, then they cannot be considered as meeting the condition for only having less than 10 finishes in an individual year. However, it is possible that other teams also have less than 10 finishes and still meet the claim criteria.\n\n5. Analyze each team's finish count:\n   - 'simon': 23, 18, 22, 13, 27, 3, 4, 2, 22 (total=90) > 10\n   - 'shierson': 20, 7, (1989 and 1990 not considered as they don't have less than 10 finishes)\n   - 'truesports': 17, 28 (total=45) > 10\n   - 'rahal / hogan': 22, 20 (total=42) > 10\n   - 'mccormack': 30, 19 (total=49) > 10\n   - 'brant': 33, 12 (total=45) > 10\n   - 'treadway': 24, 16, raced by f giaffone, raced by f giaffone (race counts as a single finish) (total=45) > 10\n\n6.
