In cricket, a nightwatchman is a batsman who comes out to bat specifically when the wicket-keeper is dismissed and the team's first choice batsmen are not available.\n\n2. Find all players who are Australian: By looking through the table, I find two players (Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie) who played for Australia.\n\n3. Check if both players have the \"nightwatchman\" role: To confirm they were nightwatchmen, I would need additional information about their roles in these matches, as the table does not explicitly state this. However, since it is reasonable to assume that a batsman can only be a nightwatchman when keeping is not an option (as per standard cricket rules), we can infer that Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie are potential candidates for being nightwatchmen in these matches based on their team position (batsmen) and opponents they faced.\n\n4. Draw a conclusion: Since there are only two players from Australia in the table, if either one of them was a nightwatchman, then the claim would be true. However, due to the lack of explicit information about their roles, I cannot definitively confirm that both players were nightwatchmen.\n\nIn this case, I am providing an answer with some uncertainty, as the claim requires specific context (nightwatchman status) not provided in the table:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find all players who are Australian\",\n    \"Check if both players have the 'nightwatchman' role\",\n    \"Draw a conclusion based on available information\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE or FALSE (with uncertainty due to lack of explicit nightwatchman status)\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
