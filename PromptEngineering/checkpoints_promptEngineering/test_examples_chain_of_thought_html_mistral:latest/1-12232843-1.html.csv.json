In the table, Jamie van hooijdonk appears in 2009 and Kerry ann sheppard appears in 2009 as well (in the 'kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey' cell of the womens doubles row).

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the target person who the claim focuses on: Jamie van hooijdonk, as mentioned in the claim.\n2. Find out the seasons in which Jamie van hooijdonk competed by scanning through the 'mens singles' and 'womens singles' columns to find rows where Jamie van hooijdonk's name appears (rows 10, 19).\n3. For each season that Jamie van hooijdonk competed, check the 'womens doubles' column to see if there is a team that competes in the same season.\n4. Analyze each partner of the team found in step 3, checking if they appear in any other row with Jamie van hooijdonk in either the 'mens singles', 'womens singles', or 'mixed doubles' columns.\n5. If no partner shares a season with Jamie van hooijdonk in any of these three columns, then it would confirm that there was indeed zero women's double team that competed when Jamie van hooijdonk competed.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the target person\",\n    \"Find seasons in which the target competes\",\n    \"Check each season for a women's doubles team\",\n    \"Analyze partners of the found teams to see if they share a season with the target in any other columns\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
