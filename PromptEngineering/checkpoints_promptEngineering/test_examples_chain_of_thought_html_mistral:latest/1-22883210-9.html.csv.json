Identify the relevant data from the table: Look for a row in the table that has the home team as \"Golden State\" (Column C) and the attendance greater than or equal to 18,581 (Column F). If such a row is found, it means the game took place at the AT&T center with at least 18,581 people attending.\n\n3. Analyze the data: After examining the table, there's no row that matches the condition set in step 2. Therefore, it's not possible to confirm or refute the claim based on the provided data.\n\n4. Final answer: Since the claim cannot be confirmed or refuted with the given information, the appropriate JSON object would look like this:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim and relevant data\", \"Analyze the data to find if there's a match for 'Golden State' as the home team and attendance greater than or equal to 18,581\", \"Determine that no such match is found in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

From the table, we can see that the San Antonio Spurs played against Golden State Warriors (row 8) and the San Antonio Spurs played against Oklahoma City Thunder (row 9).\n\n2. Check if both games took place at the AT&T Center. We can see from the table that the row corresponding to the Golden State game (row 8) has \"at&t center\" in the arena column, and the row corresponding to the Oklahoma City game (row 9) also has \"at&t center\" in the arena column.\n\n3.
