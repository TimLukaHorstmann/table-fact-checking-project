    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the player who has a score of 211. In the table, there are multiple players with a score of 211 (row 24). Among them is Boo Weekley (row_index 24, column name \"player\").\n\n2. Next, we compare the place of each player with a score of 211. The places are given in the table header (\"place\") and repeated in the first column (\"row_index 1 to 23\"). We see that the places for all players with a score of 211 are \"t10\".\n\n3. Since both conditions (player and place) match for Boo Weekley, our conclusion is that he is indeed in t10 place with a score of 211.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player with a score of 211; Compare the places of all players with a score of 211\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the table structure. Each row represents a player with their respective place, name, country, score (sum of three rounds), and 'to par'. The 'place' column indicates the player's ranking based on their scores.\n\n2. To determine if Bryce Molder is in T8 place, we need to find his row and compare it with the rows of the players who are tied for 8th place. In our table, Bryce Molder's row index is 9 and his score (sum of three rounds) is given as 210.\n\n3. We can see that rows 5 to 7 have a score of 208, but since we are looking for players tied at 8th place or higher, we move on to the next rows where scores are equal to or greater than Bryce Molder's score.\n\n4. Rows 8 and 9 show players with a score of 210. Since Bryce Molder's row (row_index=9) has the same score as these two rows, he is indeed in T8 place.\n\nNow, let's format the output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table structure and understand that each row represents a player\",\n    \"Find Bryce Molder's row (row index = 9) and compare his score with other players to determine his place\",\n    \"Look for rows where scores are equal to or greater than Bryce Molder's score\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that Bryce Molder is tied for 8th and he is -1 to par. Since both conditions are met (Bryce Molder is indeed in a tie for 8th place and his score is +1, which is one over par), the claim is FALSE because there is a contradiction between the positions and scores in the table and the statement that Bryce Molder comes in tied for 8th and he is -1 to par.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player of interest: Bryce Molder\",\n    \"Find row corresponding to the player (Bryce Molder's row index is 8)\",\n    \"Check 'to par' column for player's position relative to par\",\n    \"Compare claim with the result from step 3 and verify that both conditions are met\",\n    \"Determine whether the claim is true or false based on the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
