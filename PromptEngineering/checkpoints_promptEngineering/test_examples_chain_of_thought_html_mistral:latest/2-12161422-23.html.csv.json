For each relevant row, check the \"career span\" column to see if there are any gaps in the player's career that last for 3 years or more.\n4. If a gap of 3 years or more is found, it means there is another player who also had a break in their career.

To do this, I need to examine each row in the table for players with a career span containing a gap of 3 years or more. In this case, Kevin Murray's career span contains multiple periods without games (1970-1974, 1980-1985), but none of those gaps last for exactly 3 years. Therefore, the claim is FALSE since there are other players with breaks in their careers, such as Bert Hurrey who had a gap of 5 years (1914-1919).\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player in question: Kevin Murray\",\n    \"Check each row for the player's name to find relevant rows\",\n    \"Examine 'career span' column of relevant rows for gaps of 3 years or more\",\n    \"Compare findings with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career span\" }\n  ]\n}",

There isn't an explicit date provided, but the player with the latest career span (as of September 2013) is Dustin Fletcher who is still playing as of present. Hence, the data should be up-to-date at least until present.\n2. Next, we need to identify which players on the list are still playing in September 2013. From the table, we can see that Dustin Fletcher (row 4) and Simon Madden (row 6) were still playing as of September 2013 since their career spans go beyond this date.\n3. Finally, we check if there are exactly 8 players on the list who were still playing in September 2013. Since we have found 2 such players (Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden), it means that there must be at least 6 more players still playing but not included in our analysis due to their career spans ending before September 2013.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Determine the latest career span for identifying data's cutoff date, find out which players were still active in September 2013, and check if there are exactly 8 such players on the list.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}",

Extract the career span for each player from their respective rows in the table. For Michael Tuck, the career span is \"1972 - 1991\" and for Brad Johnson, it is \"1994 - 2010\".\n4. Convert the career spans into numerical format by finding the difference between the last year minus the first year for each player. For Michael Tuck, the career span difference is (1991-1972) = 19 years. Similarly, for Brad Johnson, it is (2010-1994) = 16 years.\n5. Compare the calculated career spans for both players. If Michael Tuck's career span is 3 years longer than Brad Johnson's, the difference between their calculated career span values should be greater than or equal to 3.
