Compare the value of the \"united kingdom\" (0) to the values in the same column for all other rows. This allows us to check if there is any row with a higher number of silver medals than the united kingdom.\n5. By examining all the rows, it can be seen that no other nation has more than 0 silver medals.\n6.
