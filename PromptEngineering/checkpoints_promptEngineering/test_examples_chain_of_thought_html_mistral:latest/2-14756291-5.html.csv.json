    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that \"bridgenorth have the highest number of wins in the ntfa div with 15 wins and only 3 losses\".\n\n2. Check the table for relevant data: We are looking for a team with the most wins and the least losses. In this table, each row represents a different team, with the first column giving the name of the team and subsequent columns giving the number of wins (second column), byes (third column), losses (fourth column), draws (fifth column), and against values (sixth column).\n\n3. Compare data for bridgenorth: Find the row corresponding to \"bridgenorth\" in the table. The value in the second column for this row is 15, which is the number of wins for \"bridgenorth\". Similarly, the value in the fourth column for this row is 3, which is the number of losses for \"bridgenorth\".\n\n4. Compare data for other teams: To determine if \"bridgenorth\" has the highest number of wins and the least number of losses, we need to compare their values with those of all other teams in the table.\n\n5. Evaluate results: After comparing the number of wins and losses of \"bridgenorth\" with those of all other teams, it can be observed that no other team has a higher number of wins (15) or a lower number of losses (3).\n\nFinally, the output in JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Check the table for relevant data\", \"Compare data for bridgenorth\", \"Compare data for other teams\", \"Evaluate results\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is George Town. We do this by looking at the first column of the table.\n2. Check the number of wins and draws for each team. For George Town, we find 9 wins and 1 draw (row index 4 in the table).\n3. Compare the number of wins with the claim that \"george town be the ntfa div 1 team that have 8 win\". Since the actual number of wins is greater than 8, it does not meet the condition given in the claim.\n4. Check if George Town has less than 2 draws. For George Town, we find 1 draw (row index 4 in the table). This meets the second part of the claim.\n5. Since there is a contradiction between steps 3 and 4, we cannot confirm that \"george town be the ntfa div 1 team that have 8 win and less than 2 draw\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team to check (George Town)\",\n    \"Check wins and draws for each team\",\n    \"Compare George Town's wins with the claim\",\n    \"Check if George Town has less than 2 draws\",\n    \"Contradiction between steps 3 and 4, cannot confirm the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"draws\" }\n  ]\n}",
