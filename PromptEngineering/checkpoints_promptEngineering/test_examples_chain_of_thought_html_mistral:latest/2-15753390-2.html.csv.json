The 8th row contains their names, so they represent the United Kingdom.\n2. Determine their ranking, or position, by reading the 'place' column. Their row index is 8, indicating they are in 8th place.\n3. Verify if the points awarded for each rank can be found in the 'points' column. In this table, it appears that a lower position corresponds to more points (for example, the team in first place has 15 points). Therefore, we expect that Roger Dutton / Tony Wright would have received less than 15 points and more than 0 points, as they are not in first place and also not last.\n4. To confirm if they indeed received 3 points, we will compare the number of points they got with their position in the table (8th place).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify rider's team and position from table, verify points awarded for each rank\", \"Determine if Roger Dutton / Tony Wright received correct number of points\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n}",

Iterate through each row of the table where the 'machine' is bmw. For each row, compare the value in the 'speed' column with 82.32 mph.\n\n3. Count the number of rows where the speed is greater than or equal to 82.32 mph.

Since there are no rows in the table where the speed is exactly 82.32 mph, we will consider the closest speeds to determine if the claim holds true. In this case, the speeds of all bmw entries are higher than 82.32 mph (91.85 mph, 91.70 mph, 79.63 mph, and 79.60 mph).\n\n5.
