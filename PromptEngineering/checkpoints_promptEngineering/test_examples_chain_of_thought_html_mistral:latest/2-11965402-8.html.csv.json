Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table to verify the claim:\n\n- For minimum attendance, we find that the smallest value is in the row with index 6 (april 15 , 2008) and column 'attendance' (17388). Since this value is greater than or equal to 10000, the claim passes for this condition.\n- For maximum attendance, we find that the largest value is in the row with index 4 (april 8 , 2008) and column 'attendance' (19060). Since this value is less than or equal to 21000, the claim passes for this condition as well.\n\nThe attendance in all games neither dropped below 10000 nor climbed above 21000.
