Determine if there are any instances where Matthew Silver won between 2003 and 2013. From step 1, we know that he won in the years 2007 and 2008, which are within the specified timeframe.\n\n3. Check if Matthew Silver was the only individual to win the championship twice during the given period. Since there is no other instance of him winning during this time (2003-2013), he could potentially be the only one to win two times.\n\n4. Validate whether there were any instances where an individual won the championship twice within the given timeframe. To do this, we will compare each team's composition and their year of winning with Matthew Silver's. By examining the table, we find that Andy Hoang & Erik Salgado (nc) also won twice during this period in 2009 and 2012. However, those years are outside the specified timeframe (2003-2013).\n\n5. Confirm that Matthew Silver was indeed the only individual to win two times within the given period by re-examining all the winning teams during this timeframe.
