Find the relevant row in the table: The name of the driver who had less than 25 laps, Jos Verstappen, was given as a counterexample. We know that Pedro de la Rosa's name should appear somewhere above Jos Verstappen's row.\n\n3. Scroll through the rows and find Pedro de la Rosa: Pedro de la Rosa is in the 17th row.\n\n4. Check the number of laps for Pedro de la Rosa: In the 17th row, under the 'laps' column, it shows that Pedro de la Rosa completed 1 lap.\n\n5.
