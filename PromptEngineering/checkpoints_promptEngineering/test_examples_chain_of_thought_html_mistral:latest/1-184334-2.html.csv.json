Find the relevant rows in the table: We need to find the row where the area is exactly 66.11. The area column can be found at the fourth column of every row in the table. We compare each value with 66.11 and stop when we find a match.\n\n3. Check if the population density (per km2) is more than 19641.5: Once we have found the relevant row, we check the fifth column to see if the population density (per km2) is greater than 19641.5.\n\n4.
