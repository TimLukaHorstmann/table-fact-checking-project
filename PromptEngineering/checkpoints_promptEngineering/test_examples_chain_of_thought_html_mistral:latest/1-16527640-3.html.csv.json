Without more context or information about the intended meaning of \"VFL game,\" this possibility cannot be confirmed or ruled out.\n5.

Identify the key term to search for: The key term here is \"vfl game\", which we assume refers to Victorian Football League (VFL) games, as VFL was the name of the highest Australian rules football competition before it became AFL.\n\n2. Search for relevant rows containing information about VFL games: Scan the table to find any entries related to Australian rules football.\n\n3. Check if the location mentioned in any row is New Guinea: Cross-reference the locations mentioned in the rows with our assumption that these are VFL games. Since New Guinea is a part of Oceania and not Australia, it's unlikely for there to be VFL games played there.\n\n4. Examine possible exceptions: However, it's important to consider the possibility of a mistake or mislabeling in the table. For instance, one row lists \"over Crete\" as the location, which is in Europe and not Australia or New Guinea. This exception might suggest that there could be other errors as well.\n\n5. Evaluate the claim: Based on our examination of the table, it's likely that there are no entries related to VFL games played in New Guinea due to its geographical location being outside of Australia.
