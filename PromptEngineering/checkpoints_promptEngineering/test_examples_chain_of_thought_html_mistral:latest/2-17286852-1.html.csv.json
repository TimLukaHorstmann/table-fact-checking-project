Next, look for relevant information about each bridge in the provided table.\n3. Examine the column names and note that there isn't a specific bridge named \"Colton's Cross\" in the table. However, we can still find out if any of the bridges share similar names with parts of Colton's Cross to see if they might be relevant.\n4. Look for bridges with names containing 'Colton', 'Cross', or other possible variations that could refer to Colton's Cross. There are no such entries in the table.\n5. Since we don't have specific information about Colton's Cross, it is impossible to find an exact match of the name mentioned in the claim. However, we can determine if there are any Pratt through truss bridges in the table as a possible alternative.\n6. Search for bridges with the 'Pratt through truss' type since that matches the type specified in the claim.\n7. Inspect the results of our search and find that there are multiple bridges with this type, but none have an explicitly matching name to Colton's Cross.\n8. Since we cannot definitively answer whether there is a Pratt through truss bridge in Colton's Cross based on the provided information, we must mark the claim as \"FALSE\".
