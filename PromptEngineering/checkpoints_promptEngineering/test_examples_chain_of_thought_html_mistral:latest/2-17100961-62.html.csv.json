Identify the claim's elements: The claim states that Jimmy Spencer was picked by the Washington Redskins in the 1st round, but he chose in the 3rd round.\n\n2. Search for relevant data about Jimmy Spencer in the table: Look for a row where the \"name\" column matches \"jimmy spencer\".\n\n3. Check the \"round\" and \"overall\" columns: If the value in the \"round\" column is 1, it confirms that he was picked in the 1st round; if the value in the \"overall\" column is lower than his pick number (20), it means he was not actually picked at this position.\n\n4. Check the \"pick\" column: If the value in the \"pick\" column matches the claim's pick number (in this case, 20), it confirms that Jimmy Spencer was indeed picked by someone with that overall pick number.\n\n5. Check the \"round\" and \"overall\" columns for any other relevant information about his choice: Look for another row where the \"name\" column matches \"jimmy spencer\", but the \"pick\" column value is the same as the claim's choice round number (in this case, 3). Also check if the \"overall\" column value is lower than the corresponding pick number in that row.\n\nNow let's find the relevant cells:\n\n- The first row with Jimmy Spencer matches the given name and has a \"round\" of 8, which contradicts the claim that he was picked in the 1st round (row_index: 4, column_name: \"round\")\n- The same row also shows an overall pick number (215) higher than the claim's choice pick number (row_index: 4, column_name: \"overall\")\n- There is no other row in the table that matches Jimmy Spencer's name and meets the claim's conditions for both the pick and choice rounds.\n\nBased on these findings, it appears that the claim is FALSE.
