    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the table structure to understand how it is organized.\n2. Note that the 'game' column seems to be a unique identifier for each row, possibly representing game number.\n3. Look for the row where 'game' equals 21. In this table, there is no such row numbered as \"21\" in the 'game' column.\n4. Consider the possibility that the game numbers are not consecutive and the relevant row might be identified by another method. However, since no other column seems to provide a clear indication of which game corresponds to February 21, it is not possible to find the row based on this information alone.\n5. Inspect the table to see if any rows contain data for February 21 in the 'february' column (which represents the day of the month). However, the 'february' column only contains days ranging from 2 to 29 and no row contains a 'february' value of 21.\n6. Based on this analysis, there is no direct way to find the row that corresponds to February 21 in this table. Therefore, it is not possible to verify whether February 21 have a score of 5 - 4.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Note that the 'game' column seems to be a unique identifier for each row\",\n    \"Look for the row where 'game' equals 21\",\n    \"Consider the possibility that game numbers are not consecutive and the relevant row might be identified by another method\",\n    \"Inspect the table to see if any rows contain data for February 21 in the 'february' column\",\n    \"There is no direct way to find the row that corresponds to February 21 in this table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the date (February 24) in the table. The date column isn't provided, but we can infer it from the row numbers since there are 29 rows and February has 28 days plus a leap day if it's a leap year. Since the table includes row 29, we can safely assume that it represents February 24.\n\n2. The score is specified as \"5 - 4\" in the claim. We need to find a row where the 'score' column matches this value.\n\n3. Examine each row and compare its score with the given value (5 - 4). We find that the score for row 63 is \"5 - 4\".\n\nNow, here's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date from the row numbers\",\n    \"Compare the score provided in the claim with each row's score\",\n    \"Find a match for the score '5 - 4'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
