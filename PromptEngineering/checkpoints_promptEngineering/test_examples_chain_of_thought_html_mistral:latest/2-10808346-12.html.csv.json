From the table, there are two instances where the crowd column value is 8000: one at Princes Park (in the second row) and another at Punt Road Oval (in the third row).\n\n2. Next, I will compare these instances with other rows to check if any other venue also has a crowd of 8000. Since there is no other instance where a crowd of 8000 occurred, it can be inferred that both instances correspond to unique venues.\n\n3. Finally, I will conclude whether the claim is true or false by checking if Princes Park is one of the two venues with a crowd participation of 8000.
