Next, I will find the number built for each chassis code by looking at the \"number built\" column of the table. The numbers associated with the chassis codes are 2.369 (w109.015), 2.519 (w109.016), 6.526 (w109.018), 9.483 (w109.056), and 2.533 (w109.057).\n\n3. To determine if w109.015 has the lowest number built, I will compare it with the other chassis codes' numbers. Comparing the values shows that w109.015 has a higher number built than w109.016 and w109.057 but lower than w109.018, w109.056.\n\n4.
