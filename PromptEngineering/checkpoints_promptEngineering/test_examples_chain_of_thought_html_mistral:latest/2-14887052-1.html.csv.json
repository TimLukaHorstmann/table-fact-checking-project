    "resp": "Chain of thought:\n1. To determine if the ratio of 16:13 has a size (steps) of 12, we need to find the frequency of this ratio within an octave (12 semitones).\n2. An octave consists of 12 semitones, and each semitone can be represented by ratios that are powers of the square root of 2 (approximately 1.41421356237).\n3. We know that a just major third (5:4) is also found within an octave, and it's related to the octave itself by the square root of 3 (approximately 1.73205080757). Since 16/13 can be represented as the product of a just major third (5:4) and a perfect fifth (3:2), we can find 16:13 by multiplying the ratios for a just major third and a perfect fifth.\n4. Multiply the ratios: (5/4) * (3/2) = (15/8).
