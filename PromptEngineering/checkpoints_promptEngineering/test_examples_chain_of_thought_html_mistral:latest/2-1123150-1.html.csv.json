If the count of unique driver names matches the number of rows (excluding headers), then there were 36 drivers attempting to compete in the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nChain of thought:\n- Step 1: We need to find the number of unique driver names. To do this, we'll go through each row and compare the driver's name with all other rows. Since the list is sorted, we can use this to our advantage. We start from the top and move downwards, comparing the current row's driver's name with the one below it. If they are different, we count it as a unique driver. Once we reach the end of the list or find a repetition, we'll have counted all drivers.\n- Step 2: Compare the number of unique drivers found in step 1 with the total number of rows (excluding headers). If both numbers match, then there were 36 drivers attempting to compete in the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Count the number of unique driver names from the table provided.
