    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the player whose information we need to check, which is Kevin Nickerson.\n2. Locate the row in the table that corresponds to the selected player (Kevin Nickerson). In this case, it's the second row of the table.\n3. Extract the 'long' column data for the selected player from the identified row. The value for Kevin Nickerson is 9 yards.\n4. Check if the extracted value (9 yards) is greater than the specified threshold (8 yards). To do this, compare 9 > 8. In this case, the result of the comparison is true.\n5. Since the selected player's long value (9 yards) is indeed greater than 8, we move on to check if Kevin Nickerson has a total of 74 yards.\n6. Locate the 'yards' column data for the selected player from the identified row. The value for Kevin Nickerson is 73 yards.\n7. Check if the extracted value (73 yards) equals the specified threshold (74 yards). To do this, compare 73 == 74. In this case, the result of the comparison is false.\n8. Since the selected player's total yards (73 yards) does not equal 74 yards, we have to conclude that the claim is not entirely accurate because it mentions \"a 74 yard,\" but Kevin Nickerson has only 73 yards.
