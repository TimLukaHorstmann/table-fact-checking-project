Extract the teams and venues: From the table, we can see all the teams playing in the games of 11th May 1957. However, to find if a team from VFL played at Victoria Park, we need to check which venue is Victoria Park and who played there on that date.\n3. Identify the rows with Victoria Park as the venue: From the table, we see only one row where the 'venue' is Victoria Park (row index 4).\n4. Check if any team from VFL played at Victoria Park on 11th May 1957: The home team in the row with Victoria Park as the venue is Carlton, and we know that the Carlton Football Club was a member of the VFL during this period. So, yes, it can be inferred that a team from VFL played at Victoria Park on 11th May 1957.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Extract the teams and venues\",\n    \"Identify the rows with Victoria Park as the venue\",\n    \"Check if any team from VFL played at Victoria Park on 11th May 1957\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\" }\n  ]\n}",
