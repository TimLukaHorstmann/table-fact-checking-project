Compare the positions of these drivers based on their time or retirement status: In the table, S\u00e9bastien Bourdais is listed ahead of Graham Rahal, which means that S\u00e9bastien finished ahead of Graham.

Check if there's any other driver from \"n / h / l racing\" who finished after S\u00e9bastien Bourdais: There are no other drivers from this team who completed more laps than S\u00e9bastien, so it can be concluded that Graham Rahal is the third-place finisher for the team.\n5.
