    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that on August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne, while the home team was Collingwood.\n\n2. Locate the relevant rows in the table for the specified date (August 13th, 1966). There are multiple matches on that day according to the provided data, so we need to compare each one.\n\n3. Compare the home and away teams in each match from step 2 with the claimed teams. If both teams match the claim for a particular match, then the claim is TRUE for that match.\n\n4. If none of the matches have both the home team as Collingwood and the away team as North Melbourne, then the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. Examine each row in the table to determine whether the claim holds true or not:\n   - Row 1: The home team is St Kilda, and the away team is South Melbourne, so this match does not meet the claimed condition.\n   - Row 2: The home team is Essendon, and the away team is Fitzroy, so this match does not meet the claimed condition.\n   - Row 3: The home team is Collingwood, but the away team is North Melbourne, so this match meets the claimed condition (if we assume that the order of home and away teams in the table is arbitrary).\n   - Row 4: The home team is Carlton, and the away team is Melbourne, so this match does not meet the claimed condition.\n   - Row 5: The home team is Richmond, and the away team is Geelong, so this match does not meet the claimed condition.\n   - Row 6: The home team is Hawthorn, and the away team is Footscray, so this match does not meet the claimed condition.\n\n6. Since there's only one match (Row 3) that meets the claimed condition, the final answer is TRUE.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Locate the relevant rows for August 13th, 1966\",\n    \"Compare each match with the claimed teams\",\n    \"Determine if any matches meet the claimed condition\",\n    \"Examine each row to confirm or refute the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
