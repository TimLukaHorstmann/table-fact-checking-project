Look at the values in the subsequent columns of the same row (the 5th column in this case) as they represent the language count for each municipality. In this case, the value is \"1167\".\n\n3. Since we don't have any specific information about a Spanish-only language category, we should compare the obtained value to the rest of the languages in the table that could be considered Spanish.

In this case, the value for Villa Alcal\u00e1 Municipality (5th column, 6th row) is \"1167\". This matches the value we obtained earlier, so it seems like it could be Spanish.\n\n5. Since we have no other information about any other language being considered or excluded, there's no reason to believe that the obtained value doesn't correspond to Spanish.
