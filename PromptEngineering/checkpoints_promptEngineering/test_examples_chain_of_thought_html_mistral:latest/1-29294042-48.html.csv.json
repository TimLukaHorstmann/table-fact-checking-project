    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for determining whether the claim \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram\" is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the weight of each competitor from the \"event\" column, which contains the competitor's weight class. The weight classes in this table are listed as finweight ( - 54 kg), flyweight ( - 58 kg), bantamweight ( - 63 kg), lightweight ( - 74 kg), and welterweight ( - 80 kg).\n\n2. Since the claim states \"the lightest competitor\", we need to find the competitor who has the lowest weight class among all competitors.\n\n3. Compare each competitor's weight class with the number that follows the '(' symbol, which represents their actual weight. For example, the first competitor is in the finweight ( - 54 kg) category and he faced an opponent with a weight of 19 (as per the round of 32 cell). So, we can see that his actual weight is -54 + 19 = 35kg.\n\n4. Perform this calculation for each competitor in the table:\n\n- Nariman Shakirov: finweight ( - 54 kg), actual weight is 35 kg\n- Zhalgas Bekkassymov: flyweight ( - 58 kg), actual weight not provided, but it must be greater than or equal to -58 kg\n- Darkhan Kassymkulov: bantamweight ( - 63 kg), actual weight is 87 kg\n- Aibar Dyussebayev: lightweight ( - 74 kg), actual weight not provided, but it must be greater than or equal to -74 kg\n- Sultan Kassymov: welterweight ( - 80 kg), actual weight is not provided, but it must be greater than or equal to -80 kg\n\n5. Compare the calculated weights of each competitor to determine the lightest one. In this case, the competitors with lower weight classes have higher actual weights, so Zhalgas Bekkassymov, who is in the flyweight ( - 58 kg) category, has the lowest actual weight among all competitors.\n\n6. Since the claim states \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram\", we need to check if the lowest actual weight from step 5 matches the claimed weight of 54 kg.\n\n7. The calculated weight for Zhalgas Bekkassymov is not 54 kg, so the answer to the claim \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the weight of each competitor, compare their calculated weights, and check if the lowest actual weight matches the claimed weight.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\" }\n  ]\n}",
