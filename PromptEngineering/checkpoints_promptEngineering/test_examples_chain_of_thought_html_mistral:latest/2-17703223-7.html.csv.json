Locate the relevant data in the table based on the name and country information provided in the claim: In this case, the row index corresponding to 'bruno brand\u00e3o (bra)' should be relevant.\n3. Check if the value in the Snatch column for the identified row matches the value specified in the claim: According to the table, the snatch value for 'bruno brand\u00e3o (bra)' is indeed 157.0, which matches the value provided in the claim.\n4. Verify that no additional factors need to be considered: No other information or conditions were mentioned in the claim that would require additional considerations.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim and relevant data, Locate the row index corresponding to 'bruno brand\u00e3o (bra)', Check if the value in the Snatch column for the identified row matches the value specified in the claim\", \"No additional factors need to be considered\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there is only one person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight be 104.70.\n\n2. Extract relevant data from the table: To verify the claim, we need to find all the rows where the 'snatch' column equals 153.0 and the 'bodyweight' column equals 104.70.\n\n3. Scan the table: Start scanning the table row by row. The table has 11 rows in total.\n\n4. Verify the claim: If we find a row where both conditions (snatch=153.0 and bodyweight=104.70) are true, then the claim is false because there would be more than one such person.
