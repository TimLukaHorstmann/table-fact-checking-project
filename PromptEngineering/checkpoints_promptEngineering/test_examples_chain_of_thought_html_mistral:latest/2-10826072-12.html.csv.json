Find all rows in the table where the home team matches the team from the claim: We will look for any row where the value of the first column (\"home team\") is \"carlton\".\n3. Extract the away team score and home team score for the matching row: Once we have found the relevant row, we need to extract the values in the third and second columns respectively (away team score and home team score).\n4. Calculate the margin of victory: Subtract the value of the away team score from the home team score. In this case, it would be `114 - 23 = 91`.\n5. Compare the calculated margin of victory with the margins of victory for all other games on the same date (19 june 1971): We need to look at every row in the table where the value of the last column (\"date\") is \"19 june 1971\". For each of these rows, calculate the margin of victory and compare it with our calculated value for carlton.\n6. Determine if the calculated margin of victory for carlton is the smallest among all games played on 19 june 1971: If we find a smaller margin of victory for any other game on the same date, then the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\". Otherwise, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team from the claim\", \"Find all rows where home team matches the given team\", \"Extract away and home team scores for the matching row\", \"Calculate the margin of victory for carlton\", \"Compare the calculated margin of victory with margins of victory for other games on the same date\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
