    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team mentioned in the claim, which is Corinthians. Find its row in the table based on the team name. In this case, it can be found in the 6th row with the position value of '6'.\n\n2. Note the number of losses for Corinthians, which is available in the 6th row and 5th column. The value is '10'.\n\n3. Identify the total number of games played by Corinthians, which is available in the 6th row and 3rd column. The value is '22'.\n\n4. To determine if there are less than 11 losses for Corinthians when they amass 22 points, we simply compare the number of losses (10) with half of the total games played (22/2 = 11). If the number of losses is less than or equal to this value, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\n5. Since the number of losses for Corinthians (10) is indeed less than 11, the final answer to the given claim would be TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find team 'Corinthians', note its position value (6), find number of losses and games played for Corinthians from their respective columns (10, 22).

Find the relevant row for the team in the table: In this case, the row index corresponding to \"Corinthians\" is 6.\n3. Extract the values from the relevant columns: For Corinthians, we are interested in the columns \"points\", \"lost\", and \"difference\".\n4. Interpret the extracted values: From the table, we see that for Corinthians:\n   - The points column value is 22.\n   - The lost column value is 10 (indicating that they have lost 10 matches).\n   - The difference column value is -20 (indicating a negative goal difference of 20).\n5. Compare the condition in the claim with the extracted values: In this case, we are interested in whether Corinthians receive zero loss when they score over 25 points. From our interpretation, we see that Corinthians have scored 22 points and lost 10 matches (which translates to losing games). Since they have not scored over 25 points, the condition in the claim is not met.\n6.
