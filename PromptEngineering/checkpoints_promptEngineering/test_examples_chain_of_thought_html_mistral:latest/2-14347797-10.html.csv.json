    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The opponent for April 14 was the New Jersey Devils.\n2. Find the row in the table corresponding to April 14: Since the date for each game is provided, we can look at the second row of the 'date' column (as it corresponds to April 10) and move down by 3 rows because there are 4 games before April 14. This will take us to the fourth row where the opponent is given.\n3. Check the opponent for April 14: In the fourth row, we find that the opponent was the New Jersey Devils.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim: The opponent for April 14 was the New Jersey Devils\", \"Find the row in the table corresponding to April 14\", \"Check the opponent for April 14\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
