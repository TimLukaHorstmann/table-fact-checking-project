Check the constructor of the car driven by this driver, which is tyrrell - ford according to the table.\n3. Verify if this driver completed 40 laps. Looking at the table, we can see that he has indeed done 40 laps.\n4. Since both conditions (driver and constructor match, and number of laps are 40) have been met, we need to confirm that there is no contradictory information about the completion of the race for this driver.\n5. Examine the \"time / retired\" column for patrick depailler's row. The value here (+ 21.47) suggests that he did not finish the race but has completed more than 39 laps, so we can infer that he retired after completing 40 laps.\n6. Compare patrick depailler with another driver who also drove a tyrrell - ford constructor and completed 40 laps, which is jody scheckter.\n7. Verify if the conditions for both drivers (tyrrell - ford constructor and 40 laps) are the same for jody scheckter. Yes, he too drove a tyrrell - ford constructor and completed 40 laps.\n8.
