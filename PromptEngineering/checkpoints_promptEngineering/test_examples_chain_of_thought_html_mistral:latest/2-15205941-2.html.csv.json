Since they have the same rank, we need to compare their row indices to determine if one appears before the other in the table.\n5. Comparing their row indices (5th for Jupp Heynckes and 2nd for Miguel Mu\u00f1oz), it is clear that Miguel Mu\u00f1oz has a smaller row index, which means he appears earlier in the list.\n6. Since Miguel Mu\u00f1oz appears before Jupp Heynckes, Jupp Heynckes is ranked higher (and therefore appears later) than Miguel Mu\u00f1oz.\n7.
