Interpret the table provided: The table shows the statistics for various players (including Rodney Stuckey) in multiple games from the 2010-2011 season. The column 'Player' is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that it contains the name of the player since each row corresponds to a different game and contains point scores.\n\n3. Search for relevant data: To verify if Rodney Stuckey led in points scored in 2 games, we need to find rows where his name appears as the player and he has the highest score among all players in those rows.\n\n4. Validate the claim: By examining the table, it can be observed that Rodney Stuckey had the highest point total for two games (row_index 70 and 72).
