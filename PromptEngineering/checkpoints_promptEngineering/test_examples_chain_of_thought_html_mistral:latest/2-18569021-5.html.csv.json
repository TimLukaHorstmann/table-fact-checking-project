Next, we examine the ranks of the top two runners in the table: allyson felix (row 1) and marshevet hooker (row 2), both have rank 1 and 2 respectively.\n\n3. We then check their respective countries to see if they are from the United States. Both athletes are indeed from the United States.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the information given in the table, it appears that two of the top runners in this race were from the United States (allyson felix and marshevet hooker), which seems to satisfy the claim made.
