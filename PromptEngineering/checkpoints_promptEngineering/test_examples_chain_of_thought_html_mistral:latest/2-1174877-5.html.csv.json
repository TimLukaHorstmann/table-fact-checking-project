However, there is a row with the description \"br co - co class 37\" which seems to be related to the number since the claim states that it belongs to this class. So, I will use this row as my reference.\n\n2. Next, I need to check if the livery matches 'ews'. In the selected row, the livery is listed as 'ews', so it satisfies this condition.\n\n3. Finally, since all the conditions (number, description, and livery) are met in the selected row, my conclusion is that the claim is TRUE for this specific instance of '37413'.\n\nNow, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row related to '37413', check if description and livery match the claim\", \"Use the row with description 'br co - co class 37' as reference since it seems to be related to '37413'\", \"Check if the livery matches 'ews'.
