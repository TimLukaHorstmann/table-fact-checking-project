Therefore, the skip referred to in the claim is rod macdonald.\n\n2. Next, I check if there exists a row in the table that matches the locale (Prince Edward Island) and the name of the skip (rod macdonald). Comparing the data, we find that the row corresponding to prince edward island has the skip named rod macdonald, so the claim refers to this row.\n\n3. Lastly, I verify whether the values of pf (67%) and end lost (51) in the claim match with the ones in the table for the identified row.
