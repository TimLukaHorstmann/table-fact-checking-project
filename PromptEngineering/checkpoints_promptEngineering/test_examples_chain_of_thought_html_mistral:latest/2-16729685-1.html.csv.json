    "resp": "Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. First, I will identify the artist whose name corresponds to 'Maggie Toal'. In the table, her row index is 7.\n   2. Next, I will find out the song associated with this artist. The column name for the song is 'song', and in the given row (row_index = 7), the value for the 'song' column is 'feed him with love'.\n   3. Then, I will check if there is any other information available about the draw of this particular performance. The column name for the draw is 'draw', but unfortunately, no such column exists in the provided table.\n   4. As I can't find a draw column, I won't be able to determine the exact place where Maggie Toal performed 'feed him with love'. However, since the song's row_index corresponds to the 7th row, and the cell at the intersection of the 'place' column and that row contains the value '7th', it indicates that Maggie Toal performed her song in the 7th position or draw.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the artist 'Maggie Toal'.\",\n    \"Identify the associated song: 'feed him with love'.\",\n    \"Check if a 'draw' column exists to determine the performance order. Unfortunately, it doesn't.\",\n    \"Since the row of the song corresponds to the place row, it suggests that Maggie Toal performed in the 7th position or draw.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\" }\n  ]\n}",
