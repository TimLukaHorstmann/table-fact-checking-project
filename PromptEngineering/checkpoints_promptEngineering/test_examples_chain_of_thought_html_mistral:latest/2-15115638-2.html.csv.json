Check the runner-up information from that row: The cell under the 'runner (s) - up' column for the sixth row contains the value \"patty sheehan\", which is the player we are trying to verify if they were a runner-up.\n\n4. Identify the winner of the tournament in that row, as this information will help us determine whether the runner-up was patty sheehan: The cell under the 'winning score' column for the sixth row contains the value \"- 8\", indicating that there was a playoff.\n\n5. Check the winner's name from the same row, in case of a playoff: In this table, the winner(s) are listed as the runner-ups when there is a playoff. So, we look for runner-ups again in the 'runner (s) - up' column for that row. In this case, the cell under the 'runner (s) - up' column for the sixth row also contains patty sheehan's name, meaning she was one of the winners in a playoff.\n\n6.
