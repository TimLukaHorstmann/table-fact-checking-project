Check the 'record' column (column 2) for each row to see how many wins and losses a fighter has.\n3. Filter out the rows that have exactly 5 wins and 3 losses. This will give us the fighters who have a 5 - 3 record.\n4. Check if there is only one fighter who matches this criterion, i.e., there are no other rows with 5 wins and 3 losses.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis would be:\n- All rows (since we're considering all fights)\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of rows.\",\n    \"Check the 'record' column and filter for rows with 5 wins and 3 losses.\",\n    \"Check if there is only one fighter who matches this criterion.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```",
