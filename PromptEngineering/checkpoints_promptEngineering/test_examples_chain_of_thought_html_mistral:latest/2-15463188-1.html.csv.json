    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be evaluated: The player named Julieta Makidato played for the team named Cebu in 2012.\n\n2. Verify the name of the player in the table: Check each row in the 'name' column for a match with \"julieta makidato\".\n\n3. Verify the school/club team of the player in the table: Check each row in the 'school / club team' column for a match with \"cebu\".\n\n4.
