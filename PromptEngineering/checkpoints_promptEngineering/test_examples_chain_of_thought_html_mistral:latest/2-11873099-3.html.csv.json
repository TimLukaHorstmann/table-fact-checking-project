Check the moving to column for each player:\n   - Moving to for Maxi is \"mallorca\"\n   - Moving to for Gabri does not have a specified team, only Ajax mentioned in country column\n\n5. Since the status and moving to columns do not match with both players, it means that Maxi has been loaned to Mallorca, but Gabri has not been loaned to Ajax (as per the table).\n\n6. Output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Locate the relevant rows in the table for Maxi and Gabri\", \"Analyze the status column for each player\", \"Check the moving to column for each player\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"moving to\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"moving to\"}\n  ]\n}",
