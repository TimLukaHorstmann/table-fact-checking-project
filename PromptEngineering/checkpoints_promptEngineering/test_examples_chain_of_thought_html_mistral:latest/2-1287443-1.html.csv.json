    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row related to the person mentioned in the claim (Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan) in the table. The relevant information about Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan is found in the second row, which has a closing date of Oct 29, 1960.\n\n2. Check if there is any other row with the same theatre and role as the row of interest (the row we found in step 1) but with a later closing date than the one in that row. In this case, there are no other rows meeting those conditions, as the subsequent rows either have different theatres or roles or earlier closing dates.\n\n3. Based on steps 1 and 2, conclude that the role for Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan did close on Feb 4, 1961, since there is no other row with a later closing date in the table.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row related to Aaron Jablonski Schuyler Grogan in the table.\",\n    \"Check if there is any other row with the same theatre and role as the row of interest but with a later closing date than the one in that row.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"closing date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"theatre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"role\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the claim: The claim states that \"aaron jablonski schuyler grogan be the name of the role for april 17 , 1966 closing date\".\n2. Find the relevant rows in the table by comparing the closing dates from the claim with the closing dates in the table. In this case, no row has an April 17, 1966 closing date.\n3. Since there is no row that matches the provided date, it means there was no performance or role with that specific closing date in the given table.
