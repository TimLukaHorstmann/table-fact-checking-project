Since the position of Wayne Cooper is indeed \"forward - center\", he may have played for a team in New Orleans.\n5. Now, check the 'years for jazz' column to see if there are any years that overlap with seasons when the New Orleans Jazz were active (1980-present). Note that the years given in the table represent the start and end of each player's tenure with the team.\n6. For Wayne Cooper, his years for Jazz are 1980 - 81, which means he played during a time when the New Orleans Jazz were active (since 1980).\n7. To determine if Wayne Cooper specifically played for the team in New Orleans, we would ideally need to know the exact name of the team he was assigned to within the New Orleans area during those years.
