Note that these pairs of teams are not matched against each other in the table. However, we can calculate their respective aggregate scores from the given data.\n\n2. For olimpia, the 1st leg score is 0 - 4 and the 2nd leg score is 0 - 2. Adding these two scores gives an aggregate score of (0 - 4) + (0 - 2) = -6 for olimpia against chicago croatian.\n\n3. For deportivo suchitep\u00e9quez, the 1st leg score is 2 - 1 and the 2nd leg score is 2 - 0. Adding these two scores gives an aggregate score of (2 - 1) + (2 - 0) = 4 for deportivo suchitep\u00e9quez against \u00e1guila.\n\n4. To compare the aggregate scores, simply subtract the smaller score from the larger one: 6 (olimpia's aggregate score) - 4 (deportivo suchitep\u00e9quez's aggregate score) = 2.
