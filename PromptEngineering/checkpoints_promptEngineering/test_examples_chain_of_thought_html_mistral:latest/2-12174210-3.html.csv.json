Next, search through the table to find a row with the school's name (column \"td_text\"): No row was found with this name.\n3. If we cannot find the school in the provided data, it is impossible to definitively answer the question: the data does not contain enough information about every single school in Rotorua district. However, since all schools in the table are either labeled as coed or not (based on their presence in the table), if a school is not present, it is reasonable to infer that they are likely not coed.\n4.

    "resp": "1. Identify the name of the school to be checked: In this case, the school to check is not explicitly mentioned in the claim, but it can be inferred as Kaharoa School since the table only contains schools within the Rotorua district.\n\n2. Search for the school in the table: The table does not contain a school named \"Kaharoa.\" However, the table lists all schools in the Rotorua district, and some of them may not have an exact match with the name mentioned in the claim but could be the correct school based on other factors such as location or age range.\n\n3. Find schools that serve Year 7 - 13: Checking the \"Year level\" column (Column 4), we can see that many schools serve students from Year 7 to Year 13. However, to find Kaharoa School specifically, we need to continue with step 4.\n\n4. Narrow down the results based on other factors: Since there is no school called \"Kaharoa,\" we cannot definitively verify the claim using the table provided. But, we can cross-check the location (Rotorua district) and age range (Year 7 - 13) with the schools in the table to find a potential match. In this case, schools such as Rotokawa School (decile 2, Year 1-13), Te Kura o te Whakarewarewa (decile 2, Year 1-8), and TKM o Ruamata (decile 2, Year 1-13) could be potential matches.\n\n5. Check the decile of the school: To verify the decile of the potential matches, we would need to access an up-to-date database or official list that includes the current deciles for each school in New Zealand. Unfortunately, the table provided does not include this information.\n\n6. Final answer and relevant cells: Since there is insufficient information to definitively verify the claim, the final answer cannot be determined at this time. The table provides essential information, but more context or additional data sources are needed to confirm or deny the claim.\n\nFinal answer (in JSON format):\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the school name\",\n    \"Search for the school in the table\",\n    \"Find schools that serve Year 7 - 13\",\n    \"Narrow down results based on other factors\",\n    \"Check the decile of the school\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Year level\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Year level\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Year level\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Year level\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Year level\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Year level\" },\n    ...
