Identify the team that Lucas di Grassi belongs to, which seems to change across seasons according to the table.\n3. Check each row of the table to find out if there's a season where Lucas di Grassi is in the \"team champion\" position. In this case, we see that he was the team champion for the Art Grand Prix in 2009 (row index 5). However, since the claim mentions the Barwa International Campos Team, let's focus on that team.\n4. Check each row to find out if there's a season where Lucas di Grassi is in the \"team champion\" position for the Barwa International Campos Team.
