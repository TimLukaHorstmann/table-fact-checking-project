Identify the key elements of the claim: The claim states that Timo Boll won the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles title 3 times between 1997 and 2012.\n\n2. Scan the table for the appearance of Timo Boll's name in the \"mens singles\" column: In this case, we find Timo Boll appearing in the rows corresponding to 2005, 2006, and 2012 (row indices 8, 9, and 17).\n\n3. Check if these appearances fall within the specified time range of 1997 to 2012: Since Timo Boll's first appearance is in 2005 (row index 8), his wins do not start before 1997. His last win was in 2012 (row index 17). So, all three appearances fall within the specified time range.\n\n4. Determine if there are exactly 3 appearances of Timo Boll winning the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles between 1997 and 2012: In this case, we have found three instances where Timo Boll won the Men's Singles title (in 2005, 2006, and 2012).\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.
