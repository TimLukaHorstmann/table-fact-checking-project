Check the lane for this row: In the first row, the value under the 'lane' column is \"4\".\n4. Confirm the nationality of the athlete matches Cuba: The second column of the first row has the value \"cuba\", which corresponds to Dayron Robles' nationality.\n5.

Scan through the rows in the table starting from the first row (row index = 0). For each row:\n   a. Read the value of the \"nationality\" column. This will give us the nationality associated with the athlete on that row.\n   b. Read the value of the \"lane\" column. This will tell us which lane the athlete is in.\n\n3. Compare each nationality (from step 2a) with \"cuba\", and each lane number (from step 2b) with 2, to check if they match the given claim (\"cuba\" is the nationality of lane 2).\n\n4.
