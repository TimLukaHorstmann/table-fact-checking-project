Look for any patterns or common terms in the episode titles that might indicate they belong to a specific season. In this case, we don't see such patterns as season numbers are not provided in the table. Instead, we can assume that the episodes are presented chronologically and consider the first few episodes as Season 1.\n3. Iterate through the table rows to find the episode title that matches \"Gary and Allison Brook\". If this title is found in one of the earlier (or first) rows, then it would be a good candidate for the most viewed episode in season 1.\n4. For each episode, look at its corresponding cell in the \"Viewers\" column to determine the number of viewers for that episode. This information will help us compare episodes and find out which one had the highest viewership.\n5.
