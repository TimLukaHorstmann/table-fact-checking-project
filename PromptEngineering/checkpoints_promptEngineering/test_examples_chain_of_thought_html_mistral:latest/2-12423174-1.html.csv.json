Identify the relevant rows based on team names: In this case, we only need to look at the row where \"Canon yaound\u00e9\" is mentioned.\n3. Find the aggregate score (total points) for Canon Yaound\u00e9: We find this in the 'agg' column of the selected row. The score for Canon Yaound\u00e9 is 9 points.\n4. Identify the opponent for Canon Yaound\u00e9: The opponent can be found in the second team name column, which is \"as solidarit\u00e9\" in the relevant row.\n5. Find the aggregate score (total points) for the opponent: Similar to step 3, we find this in the 'agg' column of the opponent's row. However, since their aggregate score is not explicitly provided, we need to calculate it based on the leg scores. The opponent's total points would be the sum of the scores from both legs.\n6. Compare the scores: To determine whether Canon Yaound\u00e9 scored 5 more points than their opponent, we compare the two scores found in steps 3 and 5. In this case, Canon Yaound\u00e9 scored 9 points, while their opponent scored 7 points (as calculated from the 1st leg score of 7-3) + 2nd leg score of 0-1 = 8 points.\n7.
