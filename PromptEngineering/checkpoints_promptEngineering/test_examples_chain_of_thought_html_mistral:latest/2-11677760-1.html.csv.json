Check the table for a row corresponding to Harrison Barnes: We find a row with the player's name (Harrison Barnes) in the first column of the table, which indicates that it is the header.\n  5. Determine if there is a cell under the city column (column with header \"City\" or \"Hometown\") for Harrison Barnes: The table does not have a column labeled as \"City\" or \"Hometown.\" However, we find a cell in the second row and third column of the table that contains information about Harrison Barnes' high school located in Ames, IA.\n  6.
