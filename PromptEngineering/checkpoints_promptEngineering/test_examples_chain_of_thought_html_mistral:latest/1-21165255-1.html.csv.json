Find the row where the number \"4300062\" can be found, this will give us the relevant episode.\n3. Check the column name that contains the season number, in this case, it's the second column labeled as \"Episode\".\n4. Examine the value of the cell in the row where we found the episode number (row_index = the row number where we found 4300062). In our example, since the episode number is 62, the row number should be 62 as well.\n5. Check the value of the cell in the second column (column name \"Episode\") of the 62nd row. This value represents the season number for the episode 4300062.\n6. Compare the season number with the claim, if they match, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nUsing this reasoning:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table and find the row containing the number '4300062'.\",\n    \"Check the second column (labeled as 'Episode') for the season number.\",\n    \"Compare the season number found in step 2 with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 62,\n      \"column_name\": \"Episode\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
