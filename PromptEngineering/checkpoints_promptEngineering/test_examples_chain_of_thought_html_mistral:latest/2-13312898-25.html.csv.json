In our table, the pick column represents the round and overall pick number (round-pick).\n3. Compare the overall pick number of \"glenn capriola\" with the claimed 24th pick in the 9th round. If the numbers match, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow let's search for \"glenn capriola\":\n- The 7th row contains a player named \"glenn capriola\".\n- In this row, the value in the 'pick' column (24) corresponds to the overall pick number.\n\nNext, we compare the overall pick number of \"glenn capriola\" with the claimed 24th pick in the 9th round:\n- The overall pick number for \"glenn capriola\" is 24 (row 7).\n- The claim specifies a 24th pick in the 9th round, which corresponds to the row index 8 since rows are 1-indexed. However, the 8th row contains a different player with an overall pick number of 220.\n\nTherefore, the player \"glenn capriola\" was not selected with the 24th pick in the 9th round, so the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Search for a player named 'glenn capriola', check its assigned draft pick, compare with the claimed pick (24th in the 9th round)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Next, we observe that the \"position\" column indicates the position of each player (e.g., wide receiver, defensive end).\n3. We then look for the row containing \"glenn capriola\" in the \"name\" column to find his information. The relevant cell is at row_index=9 and column_name=\"name\".\n4. In the row of \"glenn capriola\", we see that the value of the \"overall\" column is 247, which corresponds to the pick number in this draft.\n5. Comparing this pick number (247) with the values in the \"round\" column, we find that the smallest round number greater than or equal to 247 is 9 (since there are no values less than 247).\n6. Since the pick number of \"glenn capriola\" (247) is equal to the pick number in the 9th row, we determine that he was selected in round 9.\n7. Finally, comparing this with the claim, we find that the claim states that \"glenn capriola be not select before round 6\".
