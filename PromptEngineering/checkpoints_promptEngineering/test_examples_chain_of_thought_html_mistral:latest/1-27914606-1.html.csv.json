The table contains a table of episodes from a TV series, and the title is not specified, but we can infer it is \"The Middle\" as it is the only show with the provided episode titles and format.\n\n2. Find the relevant episode by matching the episode title \"Nut\" to one of the table rows. The title column matches with the row titled \"Whale of a Tale\" in season 7.\n\n3. Check the viewer count for the identified episode. The viewer count is located in the cell where the row index is the same as the index of the row with the episode title \"Nut\", and the column name is \"Viewers\". In this case, it is the row with an index of 79 and the column named \"Viewers\".\n\n4. Extract the value from the relevant cell.
