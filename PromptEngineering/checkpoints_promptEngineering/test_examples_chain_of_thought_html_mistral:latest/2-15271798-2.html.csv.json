Identify the conditions given in the claim: The score should be '6 - 3, 3 - 6' for the rows where the outcome is 'winner' and the surface is 'hard (i)'.\n2. Iterate through each row in the table to find matches for the specified conditions.\n3. In the first pass, observe that there are no rows with a surface of 'hard (i)' as it only appears once in the table for the year 2008.\n4. For the row where the surface is 'hard (i)', note that the outcome is 'runner-up', not 'winner'.\n5. Since we have not found any rows that match both conditions, we can conclude that there is no such score in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the conditions given in the claim\",\n    \"Iterate through each row in the table to find matches for the specified conditions\",\n    \"Observe that there are no rows with a surface of 'hard (i)' as it only appears once in the table for the year 2008\",\n    \"For the row where the surface is 'hard (i)', note that the outcome is 'runner-up', not 'winner'\",\n    \"Since we have not found any rows that match both conditions, we can conclude that there is no such score in the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
