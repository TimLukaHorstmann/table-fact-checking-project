Extract the data from the table: I will analyze each row (year) to check if there are instances where 2 races happened for a particular year.\n\n3. Iterate through the rows: For each row, look at the 'points' column to determine the number of races for that year.\n\n4.

For example, in 1984, there were 2 races for the team 'barclay nordica arrows bmw'. In the same year (1984), another race also took place for the same team but with a different chassis ('arrows a7'). This means that 1984 had 3 races.\n\nThe same thing applies to 1985, where 'barclay arrows bmw' raced twice (with chassis 'arrows a8') and another time with the chassis 'arrows a9'. In this case, 1985 had 3 races as well.\n\nNow let's consider 1987 and 1988. In these years, the team 'benetton formula ltd' raced twice, but each year has only one chassis. This means that both 1987 and 1988 had exactly 2 races.\n\nIn summary, the years with 3 races are:\n- 1984 (twice)\n- 1985 (twice)\n\nThe years with 2 races are:\n- 1987\n- 1988\n\nSo there are instances where a year had 2 races, but it did not happen on 4 occasions as claimed.
