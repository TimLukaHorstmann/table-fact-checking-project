Find the row for the third position: Since the table is sorted by year, we can't determine the exact row number for the third position directly. However, we can assume that the years are listed in ascending order and find the positions for each year to verify if there's a missing position between any two consecutive rows.\n   3. Check the positions: In 1994, the position is 11th. In 1998, the position is 3rd. There seems to be no row for the years in between (1995-1997). Since there's a 2nd place finish in 1999 and a DNF in 2000, we can assume that the missing positions are also not first or DNF.\n   4. Check the finishing times: In the row where the position is 3rd (1998), the finishing time is 2:12:53.\n   5.
