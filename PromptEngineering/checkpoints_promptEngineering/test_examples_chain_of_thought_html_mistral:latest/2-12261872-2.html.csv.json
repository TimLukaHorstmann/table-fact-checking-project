The table does not provide a date, but the list of riders indicates that it is likely from the 1990s or later due to the presence of riders like Tony Rominger, who began his career in the mid-80s and retired in the late 90s.\n2. Since there is no year provided, I cannot confirm if this table represents data from the 1945 Giro d'Italia. However, the table does show a list of riders competing for a classification called \"stone,\" which doesn't seem to be a traditional classification in the Giro d'Italia before the late 20th century.\n3. The table indicates that multiple riders were leading the \"stone\" classification. If we assume that this is a misnomer and the race was actually the Giro d'Italia, then it would contradict the claim that only two riders led the general classification during the 1945 Giro d'Italia.\n4. However, without confirming the year of the race or the accuracy of the data in this table, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false.\n\n   Answer: \"FALSE\"\n   Relevant Cells: [\n     { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"final\" },\n     ...
