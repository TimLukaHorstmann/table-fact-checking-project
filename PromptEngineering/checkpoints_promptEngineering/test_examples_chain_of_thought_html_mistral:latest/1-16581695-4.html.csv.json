Identify the column names and note their significance: The table has 6 columns, each with a different purpose - no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original airdate, and production code.\n2. Determine the relevant information for the claim: The claim states that the episode with production code 303 should be number 29 in the series. This means we need to find the row where the production code is 303 and compare it with the \"no in series\" value for that same row.\n3. Locate the row with production code 303: By scanning through the table, we find the row with production code 303 at row index 5 (since the first row is the header). The relevant cell for this step is: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n4. Compare the \"no in series\" value of the row with production code 303 to 29: In the same row (row index 5), we find the \"no in series\" value which is \"28\". This means the episode with production code 303 is actually number 28, not 29.\n5. Output the final answer based on the comparison: Since the claim states that the episode with production code 303 should be number 29 in the series, but we found it to be number 28, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names\", \"Determine relevant information for the claim\", \"Locate the row with production code 303\", \"Compare 'no in series' value to 29\", \"Output the final answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}]\n}",

To check the claim \"episode 12 of season 3 was directed by Rick Morales\", we need to find the episodes that match both conditions: episode number is 12 and the season number is 3.\n\n3.
