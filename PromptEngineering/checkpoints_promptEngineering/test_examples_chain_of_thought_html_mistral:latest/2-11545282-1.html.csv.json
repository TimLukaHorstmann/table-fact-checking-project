Identify the key information from the table and claim:\n   - The table provides data on various players who have played for the Utah Jazz, including their nationality, position, years for the Jazz, and school/club team.\n   - The claim states that after 1985, the United States has contributed 2 players with Rafael Arajo being the most recent.\n\n2. Filter the data based on the nationality:\n   - We see that 7 out of the 10 players are from the United States.\n\n3. Identify the start year for each player:\n   - For each player, we find their first year in the Jazz as provided under the \"years for jazz\" column.\n\n4. Sort the data based on the start year and check if any player started after 1985:\n   - We see that 3 out of the 7 American players (JJ Anderson, Shandon Anderson, Rafael Arajo) started after 1985.\n\n5. Check if Rafael Arajo is indeed the most recent player among those who started after 1985:\n   - We see that Rafael Arajo started in 2006, which is later than both JJ Anderson (1982) and Shandon Anderson (1996). Thus, Rafael Arajo is indeed the most recent player among those who started after 1985.\n\n6. Finally, verify if there are exactly 2 players from the United States that started after 1985:\n   - We have identified 3 players from the US who started after 1985 (JJ Anderson, Shandon Anderson, Rafael Arajo). However, since JJ Anderson and Shandon Anderson both started before 1986, only Rafael Arajo remains. Hence, we have 2 players (Rafael Arajo) from the United States who started after 1985.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is TRUE.
