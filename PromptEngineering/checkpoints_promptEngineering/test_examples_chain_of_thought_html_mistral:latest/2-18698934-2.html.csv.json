Identify the games based on the venue where they were played, specifically focusing on the two venues mentioned in the claim - Estadio Campo Desportivo (Macau) and Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground (Hong Kong).\n\n2. For each of these venues, find the corresponding results from the table. In this case:\n   - The game played at Estadio Campo Desportivo was a 5-1 win for the team. This result is stored in row index 0 with column name \"result\".\n   - The game played at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground was a 1-0 win, and also a goal was scored by the opposing team (indicating that the result could be 0-1 or 1-1). This game is stored in row index 2 with column name \"result\".\n\n3. Compare the results to determine if the result at Estadio Campo Desportivo is better than the one at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground. To do this, we can look at the number of goals scored by the home team (in this case, Macau) in both matches. In the game played at Estadio Campo Desportivo, Macau scored 5 goals, while in the game at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground, Macau only scored 1 goal.\n\n4. Since the number of goals scored by the home team (Macau) is higher in the game at Estadio Campo Desportivo compared to the one at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground, we can conclude that the result was indeed better at Estadio Campo Desportivo.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the games played at the two specified venues: Estadio Campo Desportivo and Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground\", \"Compare the results of these games by looking at the number of goals scored by the home team (Macau) in each game\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
