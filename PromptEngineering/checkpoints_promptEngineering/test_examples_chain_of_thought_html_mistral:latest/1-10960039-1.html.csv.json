This means we need to check if Alexis Bwenge's pick number is 8 and his current team is BC Lions.\n2. Find the row in the table that corresponds to Alexis Bwenge: We can do this by looking for a player with the name \"alexis bwenge\". In this case, it's on row 8.\n3. Check if the pick number (column 'pick') is 8: Looking at the relevant cell, we see that the value is '8'. So, yes, Alexis Bwenge's pick number is indeed 8.\n4. Check if the current team (column 'cfl team') is BC Lions: Looking at the relevant cell, we see that the value is 'bc lions'. So, yes, Alexis Bwenge currently plays for the BC Lions.\n\nSince all checks have confirmed the claim, my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim and its components\", \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to Alexis Bwenge\", \"Check if the pick number (column 'pick') is 8\", \"Check if the current team (column 'cfl team') is BC Lions\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"cfl team\"}]\n}\n```",
