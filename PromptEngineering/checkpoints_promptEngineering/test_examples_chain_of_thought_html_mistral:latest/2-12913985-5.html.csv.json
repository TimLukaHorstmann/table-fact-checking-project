This can be done by looking at the \"country\" column for rows where the value is \"united states\". In this case, there are 8 such players.\n\n2. Determine each player's score (sum of their scores on the first two days). This can be found by adding the values in the \"score\" column for each row where the \"country\" is \"united states\".\n\n3. Sort the United States players based on their total scores from lowest to highest.\n\n4. Check who among these sorted players has the lowest score (highest negative value in the \"to par\" column, as it indicates better performance). The player with the lowest score is the top finishing player from the USA.\n\n5. Compare this sorted list with the name of Billy Kratzert.

The players who are citizens of the United States are Billy Kratzert, Ben Crenshaw, David Edwards, Greg Norman (but he is not from the U.S.), Bernhard Langer (he is also not from the U.S.), Gary Koch, Mark McCumber, Corey Pavin, and Bob Tway.\n\n2. Next, find out the scores of these players by looking at the 'score' column. The scores for the United States players are 140 (Billy Kratzert), 142 (Ben Crenshaw, David Edwards, and three others), 143 (Gary Koch, Mark McCumber, Corey Pavin, and Bob Tway).\n\n3. Compare the scores of these players to determine their ranking. To do this, start with the highest score and move down the list, marking off the players as you go. In this case, we can eliminate all the players who have a score higher than 140 (Billy Kratzert) first. This leaves us with Billy Kratzert, Ben Crenshaw, David Edwards, and three others with a score of 142. Next, compare the scores of these four players to find out their exact ranking within this group.
