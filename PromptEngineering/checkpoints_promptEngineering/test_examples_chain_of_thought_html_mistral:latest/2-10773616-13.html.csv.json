Find the row of South Melbourne in the table: The team South Melbourne can be found in the second row, with the \"home team\" column value being \"south melbourne\".\n\n3. Find the venue for South Melbourne: In the same row as the home team, look for the \"venue\" column to determine where South Melbourne played their matches. Here, it is \"lake oval\".\n\n4. Check if the score listed for South Melbourne at Lake Oval matches the claim: Compare the score (home team score) of South Melbourne from the table with the claimed score. In this case, the score in the second row (8.18 or 66 in decimal form) is indeed 8.18 (66).\n\n5. Confirm the match date to ensure there was a match on that day at the given venue: The date for the match in the second row is \"24 july 1954\", which corresponds with the venue \"lake oval\".

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that when South Melbourne is the away team, their score is 8.18 (66) when they play at Lake Oval.\n\n2. Find the row of South Melbourne as the away team in the table: To find this, look for a row where the \"home team\" cell has a value different from \"South Melbourne\". In the given table, South Melbourne is listed as the home team in the first row. So we have to check the remaining rows (second to last and last) for the condition of being the away team.\n\n3. Check if the venue matches Lake Oval: To confirm if the match took place at Lake Oval, look for a row where the \"venue\" cell has the value \"Lake Oval\". In this table, only one remaining row has Lake Oval as its venue (last row).\n\n4. Verify that South Melbourne is indeed the away team in the selected row: Since we have found a row with Lake Oval as its venue, check if South Melbourne appears as the away team in this row by looking at the \"away team\" cell. In this table, the last row has South Melbourne as the away team.\n\n5. Confirm that the score matches 8.18 (66): To verify the score, look for a cell with the value 8.18 or 66 in the row we selected earlier. In the given table, the \"away team score\" cell in the last row has the value 8.18 which is equal to 66 when converted from fraction form.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim have been met (South Melbourne as the away team, Lake Oval as the venue, and the correct score), the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find South Melbourne as an away team in the table\", \"Check if the venue matches Lake Oval\", \"Verify that South Melbourne is indeed the away team in the selected row\", \"Confirm that the score matches 8.18 (66)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team that plays at Footscray. From the table, we can see that the home team for the match on 24 july 1954 at 'western oval' is 'footscray'.\n\n2. Check if this team has a score of 818 (66) when they play at Footscray.
