Check the third column of this row, which corresponds to the win-loss-tie record. The value here is \"13 - 11 - 3\".\n3. Since we are comparing the record after the game on January 18 and it's provided that the record was \"13 - 11 - 3\" after this game, we can directly compare these two records.\n4.

Convert the record format from M-W-L to W-L-D (Wins-Losses-Draws) because the question asks for the number of wins and losses after the game on January 6th.

To determine if the record after the game on January 6th was \"9 - 10 - 3\", we need to compare this converted record with the provided one (9-10-3).\n\n4.

From the table, count the number of wins (V), losses (L), and ties (T) by considering the \"Result\" column for all rows before row 19 (January 18 game).\n3. Wins: 10 games with a result of \"W\" in the \"Result\" column, so V = 10.\n4. Losses: 15 games with a result of \"L\" in the \"Result\" column, so L = 15.\n5. Ties: 2 games with a result of \"T\" in the \"Result\" column, so T = 2.\n6. Calculate the total number of games played up to January 18 (row 19) by counting all rows before row 19 in the table, excluding the header row. This gives us N = 30 - 1 = 29.\n7. Determine the record after the January 18 game using the formula W-L-T, where W is wins, L is losses, and T is ties.

    "resp": "1. Identify the team: The table provided shows the records of the Chicago Blackhawks.\n2. Find the game on January 6th: To find the game on January 6th, we need to count back from the last game (which is listed as March 19th) and look for a Saturday. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so counting back 55 days (3/19 - 1/6) would take us past a full week (7 * 8 = 56 days), which means we need to subtract one day (one weekend). So, we count back 54 days from March 19th and find February 20th.\n3. Check the result: On February 20th, the Blackhawks played against Montreal Canadiens. In the table provided, there is no game listed on February 20th. However, we can extrapolate the score by looking at the scores of the two games immediately preceding and following that day. The score on February 19th was 4-6 (loss) and the score on February 21st was 3-5 (loss). Since there is no game listed on February 20th, we can infer that the result would have been a loss for the Blackhawks, given their pattern of losing games.\n4. Evaluate the claim: The record after January 6th would be up to and including the game on January 6th, since no game was played on February 20th (as per our analysis). On January 6th, the Blackhawks won against the Detroit Red Wings with a score of 3-2. Therefore, their record up to and including that game would have been 10 wins (9 before + 1 on Jan 6), 9 losses, and 1 tie.\n5.
