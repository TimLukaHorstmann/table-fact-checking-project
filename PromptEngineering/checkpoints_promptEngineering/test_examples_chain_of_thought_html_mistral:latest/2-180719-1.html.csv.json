The first place winner has the maximum number of points (sum of \"points\" column), and the runner up has the second highest number of points.\n2. Look for the row with the maximum value in the \"points\" column to find the first place winner, which is row 3 (Jimmy Makulis from Germany) with 1 point.\n3. Find the row with the second-highest value in the \"points\" column to find the runner up. Compare each row's points value with the maximum value until we find a row with one less point than the maximum, which will be the runner up. We can compare rows sequentially from the first place winner (row 3) since the number of points only decreases after the first place.\n4. Start comparing rows from row 3, and we find that row 1 (Conchita Bautista from Spain) has 8 points, which is one less than the maximum of 9 points. Therefore, Conchita Bautista from Spain is the runner up.\n5. Calculate the point difference between the first place winner and the runner up by subtracting the runner up's points (8) from the first place winner's points (1). The result is 1.\n6. Compare the calculated point difference with the claim: \"there be only a small point difference between the first place winner of the 1961 Eurovision Song Contest and the runner up\".
