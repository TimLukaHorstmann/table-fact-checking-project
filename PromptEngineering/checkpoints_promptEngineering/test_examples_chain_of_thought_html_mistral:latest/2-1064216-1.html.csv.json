Count the total number of lecturers and associate professors across all rows to get a baseline for comparison.\n3. Compare the count of associate professors with that of lecturers to see if there is a 6-fold difference.\n\nAfter analyzing the table, here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Count the number of lecturers and associate professors in each row:\n   - Row 1: Lecturers = 5, Associate Professors = 35\n   - Row 2: Lecturers = 9, Associate Professors = 10\n   - ... continue this process for all rows ...\n\n2. Count the total number of lecturers and associate professors across all rows:\n   - Total Lecturers = 5 + 9 + ... + 2 = 49\n   - Total Associate Professors = 35 + 10 + ... + 4 = 87\n\n3. Compare the count of associate professors with that of lecturers:\n   - Difference = 87 (Associate Professors) - 49 (Lecturers) = 38\n\nSince the difference is not equal to 6 times the number of lecturers, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the number of lecturers and associate professors in each row\",\n    \"Count the total number of lecturers and associate professors across all rows\",\n    \"Compare the count of associate professors with that of lecturers\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"associate professors\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lecturers\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the total number of schools represented in the table. In this case, there are 10 rows (schools).\n2. Calculate the total sum of 'total' column to get the total amount of academic staff across all schools. Sum = 120 + 96 + 81 + 55 + 119 + 78 + 49 + 51 + 28 = 737\n3. Divide the total sum by the number of schools to get the average per school. Average = Total Sum / Number of Schools = 737 / 10 = 73.7\n4. Compare the calculated average with the claim value of 70. The difference between the calculated average and the claim value is 3.7 (73.7 - 70).\n5. Since the calculated average is not exactly equal to the claim value, we cannot conclude that the claim is TRUE. However, if we consider a small deviation in averages due to rounding errors or other factors, we might still consider it as approximately true depending on the context.\n6. To provide a definitive answer, we can say that the calculated average is close to, but not exactly equal to, the claim value of 70.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the total number of schools\",\n    \"Calculate the sum of the 'total' column\",\n    \"Divide the total sum by the number of schools to get the average per school\",\n    \"Compare the calculated average with the claim value\",\n    \"Determine whether the calculated average is exactly equal to the claim value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    //... and so on for all the rows (schools) in the table\n  ]\n}",
