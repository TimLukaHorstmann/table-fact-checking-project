Assess the claim: The verb forms do not match, so '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo' cannot be the injunctive of '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo'.\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: The claim states that '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo' is the injunctive of '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo'.\",\n    \"Understand context: Each row represents a tense/mood, and each column represents a person.

Understand the table structure: The table presents different verb conjugations in Nepali language based on tense and person. The rows represent the verbs, and the columns represent the tenses (simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative).\n\n3. Find the relevant cells: Look for the row that contains \"second person singular low - grade\" and the column that contains \"simple past\". In this case, the relevant cell is at row_index=2 and column_name=\"simple past\".\n\n4. Compare the values: Compare the value in the identified cell (\"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\") with the verb given in the claim (garchas). If they are the same or similar in meaning, then the claim may be true.\n\n5. Finalize the answer: The value \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" means 'you did', which is the simple past tense of the verb 'to do' in Nepali. On the other hand, 'garchas' means 'you (will) do'. Although they have different tenses, the simple past and future are not directly connected in this context. However, since '\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari' is the simple past of some verb that corresponds to '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas', the claim can be considered as partially true because '\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari' is indeed a part of the tense chain related to '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas'.\n\nNow, let me present the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Find the relevant cells (row=2, column='simple past')\",\n    \"Compare the values ('\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari' vs 'garchas')\",\n    \"Finalize the answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"PARTLY_TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"simple past\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the cells relevant to the claim. In our table, the claim refers to two verbs: 'you (will) do', which can be found under \"second person singular low - grade\" and \"probable future\" columns, and 'you did' under \"second person singular low - grade\" and \"simple past\" columns.\n2. Second, compare the corresponding cells for both verbs to determine if they are the same or different. In our table, 'you (will) do' is represented by '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d', and its row index is 3 and column name is \"probable future\". On the other hand, 'you did' is represented by '\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d', and its row index is also 3 but column name is \"simple past\".\n3. Third, inspect the values of the cells corresponding to the identified rows. In our case, the value for 'you (will) do' in the table is '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d' which translates to 'you (will) do'. On the other hand, the value for 'you did' is '\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d' which does not translate directly to 'you did', but it is a different verb form that does indeed have the same meaning as 'you did'.\n4. Fourth, determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison in step 3. In our case, since the verb forms for 'you (will) do' and 'you did' are not identical but have the same meaning, they cannot be considered the same, so the claim \"the probable future of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the cells relevant to the claim\",\n    \"Compare the corresponding cells for both verbs\",\n    \"Inspect the values of the cells corresponding to the identified rows\",\n    \"Determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"probable future\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"simple past\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
