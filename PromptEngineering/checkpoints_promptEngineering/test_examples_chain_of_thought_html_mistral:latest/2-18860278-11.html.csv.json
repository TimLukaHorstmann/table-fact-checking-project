Locate the row in the table where the player's name matches the target player (David Rose) - This is the fourth row of the table.\n\n3. Check the column corresponding to 'int'l debut' for the selected row - The value in this cell for David Rose is \"ru test v france\".\n\n4. Recall that a match date in the table is given in text format, while years are shown as numeric values. As such, we cannot determine the year of the international debut directly from the table. However, since we know that the player made his international debut in 1951 (as per claim), it means that the 'international debut' entry for David Rose must be a match that took place in 1951 or earlier.\n\nSince we cannot verify whether the 'international debut' entry is exactly in 1951 based on the information provided, our answer will be \"partial truth.\" However, if we assume that the table only contains correct data, then it can be said that David Rose played his international debut in a match prior to 1951, which aligns with the claim.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify target player (David Rose), locate row containing this player, check 'int'l debut' column, recall that the year is given in text format and cannot be determined directly from the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"PARTIAL TRUTH\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"int'l debut\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the player: The player for whom we need to check the international and cross-code debuts is Roy Muir Kinnear, as per the claim.\n\n2.
