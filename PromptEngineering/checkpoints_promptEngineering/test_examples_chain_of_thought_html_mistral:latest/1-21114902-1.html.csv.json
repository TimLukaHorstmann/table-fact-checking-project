To verify the claim, we need to find out how many times Joe Lauzon won Fight of the Night and Knockout of the Night awards in UFC events.\n3. We are given a table containing data about several UFC fighters, but it does not specifically mention Joe Lauzon or any awards he has received.\n4. The table contains a column named \"Knockout\" for each fighter which shows their total number of knockouts, but there is no column explicitly labeled as \"Fight of the Night\". This makes it impossible to confirm the claim based on the given data.\n\nanswer: FALSE\nrelevant_cells: []",

However, we can infer that the \"Submission\" claim refers to victories where a fighter forces their opponent to tap out during a match.\n\n2. Find Matt Wiman's row and check if there is a victory marked as a \"Submission\": In this table, Matt Wiman's row is the 15th row (index 14, since we are zero-based). We need to scan his victories for any that are marked as a \"Submission.\"\n\n3. Check each relevant cell in Matt Wiman's row for a Submission victory: In the table, there is no explicit column for victory types. However, we can assume that a submission would be recorded under the \"Result\" column (column C). Scanning the \"Result\" values for Matt Wiman's row, we do not find any entry that indicates a \"Submission.\"\n\n4.
