    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the schools from the table, as these are the entities that can have enrollment numbers associated with them. In this case, the schools are listed under the \"name\" column (Column 0).\n\n2. Next, we look at the \"enrollment\" column (Column 3), which provides the number of students each school has. This is the relevant metric to compare in order to determine the claim about who has the lowest enrollment.\n\n3. We then compare the enrollment values for each school listed in the table. The schools' names and their respective enrollments are as follows:\n   - erin district high school: 649 students\n   - college heights secondary school: 649 students (same enrollment as \"erin district high school\")\n   - centennial collegiate vocational institute: 1533 students\n   - centre dufferin district high school: 998 students\n   - centre wellington district high school: 1459 students\n   - guelph collegiate vocational institute: 1314 students\n   - john f ross collegiate vocational institute: 1895 students\n   - norwell district secondary school: 795 students\n   - orangeville district secondary school: 1574 students\n   - wellington heights secondary school: 680 students\n   - westside secondary school: 996 students\n\n4. We observe that the \"erin district high school\" and \"college heights secondary school\" have the same enrollment number, which is 649. However, according to the claim, we are looking for the school with the lowest enrollment, so it is crucial to find out which one has the row index that corresponds to its location in the table.\n\n5. To do this, we compare the row indices of both schools in the table, and we find that \"erin district high school\" appears before \"college heights secondary school\". In other words, row 4 (index 3) comes before row 7 (index 6). Thus, according to the order listed in the table, \"erin district high school\" is listed first.\n\nSince \"erin district high school\" is listed first and has the same enrollment number as another school, we must check their location to determine which one comes before the other. As \"erin district high school\" appears earlier than \"college heights secondary school\" in the table, it follows that \"erin district high school\" has the lowest enrollment among all schools listed in the table.\n\nFinally, our JSON output is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all the schools from the table.\",\n    \"Compare enrollments of each school to determine which one has the lowest enrollment.\",\n    \"Find the row indices of the schools with the lowest enrollment in the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\" }\n  ]\n}",
