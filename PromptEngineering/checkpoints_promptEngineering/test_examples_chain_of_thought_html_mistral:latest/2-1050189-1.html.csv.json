    "resp": "1. Compare the win-loss records for the Greenville Braves from the previous year (1991) and the specified year (1992).\n\n2. To find the win-loss record of the previous year, we need to look one row above the 1992 row in the table.\n\n3. In the table, the win-loss record for 1991 is not provided, but based on the pattern and the order, it seems that there might have been a missing row or data between 1991 and 1992. However, since we cannot make assumptions about the missing data, we should compare the given win-loss records as they are.\n\n4. In the specified year (1992), the Greenville Braves had 73 wins and 63 losses, for a total of 73 + 63 = 136 games played.\n\n5. As there is no data available for the previous year (1991), we cannot compare their win-loss records directly. However, we can observe that in the specified year (1992), the Greenville Braves have a record of 73 wins, which is more than the number of losses they had in that year (63).\n\n6. Since we are only asked to compare the win count between the two years and not the total games played or loss count, it is still possible for the Greenville Braves to have more wins in 1992 than the previous year, even without knowing their exact win-loss record from the previous year.\n\n7. Final answer: Since we cannot directly compare the win-loss records of the previous and specified years due to missing data, it is not possible to definitively say whether the Greenville Braves have more wins in 1992 than the previous year. However, given the information available, it appears that they do have more wins in 1992 compared to their losses in that year (63), which suggests that they could potentially have had more wins in the previous year as well.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare win-loss records for Greenville Braves between 1992 and a presumed 1991, using available data.\", \"Assume missing data is present and cannot be filled based on given information.\", \"Observe that in 1992, Greenville Braves had 73 wins and 63 losses.\", \"Compare win count of 1992 with the loss count of 1992 (73 > 63), suggesting a possible increase in wins compared to the previous year.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"UNDETERMINED\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"Wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"Losses\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
