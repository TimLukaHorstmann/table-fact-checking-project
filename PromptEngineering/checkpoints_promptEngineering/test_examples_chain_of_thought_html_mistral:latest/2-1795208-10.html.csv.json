Extract relevant data from the table for the given year (2009) and tournament (Paul Hunter Classic). In this case, there are two rows matching these conditions.\n\n3. Compare the opponents in these rows with the claimant, Jimmy White. The opponents in both rows are indeed Jimmy White.\n\n4. Verify whether they are from the same year as specified in the claim. Both rows have the same year, 2009.\n\n5. Lastly, confirm if they are from the Paul Hunter Classic tournament. Both rows indicate the tournament as Paul Hunter Classic.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Extract relevant data for the given year and tournament\",\n    \"Compare the opponents with the claimant\",\n    \"Verify if they are from the same year\",\n    \"Confirm if they are from the Paul Hunter Classic tournament\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scan the relevant data range: In our table, there are two rows that meet these criteria (rows with indexes 3 and 5).\n\n4.
