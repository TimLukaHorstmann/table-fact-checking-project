In this table, the teams change but not the riders, so it's assumed that each row represents a different team and the same racer.\n\n2. Next, count the number of times a specific team (in this case, Aermacchi) appears in the table for a given rider. We can do this by looking at the 'Team' column (which corresponds to the manufacturer) and counting the rows where it says 'Aermacchi'.\n\n3. After counting the number of Aermacchi teams, compare this count with the maximum count across all teams for that racer. To find the maximum count, we need to go through each team's row in the table and take note of the highest count.\n\n4.
