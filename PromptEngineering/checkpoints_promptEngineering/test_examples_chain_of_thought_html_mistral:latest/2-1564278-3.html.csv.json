Next, determine where in the table we can find information about opponents and their respective dates: We see that the 'opponent in the final' column of the table contains the players who were opponents in the final of a tournament. The date each match was played is provided in the 'date' column.\n3. Check if there exists a row where the 'opponent in the final' is Wesley Moodie and the 'date' is June 2, 2003: We find that there is such a row, where the opponent in the final is indeed Wesley Moodie and the date is June 2, 2003.\n4. Verify that Alex Bogdanovic was not the opponent on this date: We do not see any information about Alex Bogdanovic being the opponent on June 2, 2003, so it is safe to assume that he was not the opponent in this case.\n5. Finally, draw a conclusion based on our findings: Since Wesley Moodie was the opponent on June 2, 2003, and we did not find any evidence that Alex Bogdanovic was the opponent on this date, it would be incorrect to conclude that they were opponents on June 2, 2003.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Locate relevant columns in table\",\n    \"Check if there is a row matching the date and opponent\",\n    \"Verify that Alex Bogdanovic was not the opponent on this date\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",
