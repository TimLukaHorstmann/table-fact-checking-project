Find the relevant data: Look for a row in the table where the date matches \"July 29\" and the team playing at home is \"SK Brann\".\n\n3. Analyze the found data: If there's a match on July 29 with SK Brann as the home team, then it would support the claim that they host the Champion League (Q) that day.\n\n4. Check for multiple matches on the same date for SK Brann: To ensure accuracy, we need to confirm that there is no other match involving SK Brann on July 29.\n\n5.
