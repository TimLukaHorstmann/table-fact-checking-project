We find a match with that score in the table under the \"runner-up\" outcome and the year 2000.\n2. To determine the surface of the court for this match, we look at the \"surface\" column corresponding to the same row index (since the rows are organized by match).\n3. We find that the surface of the court is clay for the match in 2000, as indicated by the value in the \"surface\" column.\n4. Compare the claimed surface with the actual surface from the table. The claim states that the surface is not clay. Since the actual surface is clay, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
