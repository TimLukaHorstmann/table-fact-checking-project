    "resp": "Reasoning Steps:\n1. Identify the row where the opponent is Philadelphia Flyers, as the claim mentions this team. This corresponds to the 61st row of the table.\n2. In the \"record\" column of this row, check if the value matches the one given in the claim (40 - 11 - 10).\n3. Compare the date of February 23rd with the dates listed in the \"td\" tags for each row to confirm that we are looking at the correct game. In this case, the game on February 23rd does not appear in the table, so we cannot verify if the record is correct for that specific date.\n4. However, since the provided record value (40 - 11 - 10) matches with the one shown for Philadelphia Flyers in the table, it suggests that the team had this record prior to February 23rd.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to the Philadelphia Flyers\",\n    \"Check the 'record' value in this row\",\n    \"Compare the provided record value with the one from the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE (as of the data presented)\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}",
