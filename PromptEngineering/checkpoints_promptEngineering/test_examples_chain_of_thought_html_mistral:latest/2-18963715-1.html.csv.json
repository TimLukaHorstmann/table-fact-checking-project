Examine the table column headers to understand the structure of the data: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. The year is consistent across all rows, indicating that this table represents awards for a specific year (2009).\n3. Scan the table for rows matching the claim's criteria: 'year = 2009', 'award ceremony' can be any value since it's not specified in the claim, 'category' should be 'best play', and 'nominee' should be 'neil labute'.\n4. Find the row that matches these criteria: The first row has 'neil labute' as the nominee and the third row has 'best play' as the category, but they are for different award ceremonies (tony award and drama desk award respectively). However, there is no row with both conditions ('year = 2009', 'category = best play') and 'nominee = neil labute'.\n5.

Identify the nominee for best play: To determine if a work was nominated more than once, we first need to identify which entry in the table represents the \"best play\" category. However, there is no explicit 'nominee' for this category in the table.\n\n2. Check other awards for consistency: If a specific work (play) was not explicitly mentioned as a nominee in the best play category, we can look for possible clues by checking the nominations in other categories related to the same year and award ceremony.\n\n3. Analyze the data: In this case, there are multiple nominations within the same year and award ceremony for categories that include \"play.\" Since plays require a script and they do not change every time they are staged, it is likely that these multiple nominations refer to the same play (reason to be pretty).\n\n4. Conclude: Based on our analysis, we cannot explicitly verify if \"reason to be pretty\" was nominated for best play more than once since there's no explicit mention of it in this table. However, it is possible that this work was indeed nominated multiple times across various categories related to the same award ceremony (2009 Tony Award).\n\n   Output:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the nominee for best play; Check other awards for consistency; Analyze the data; Conclude\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n     ]\n   }",
