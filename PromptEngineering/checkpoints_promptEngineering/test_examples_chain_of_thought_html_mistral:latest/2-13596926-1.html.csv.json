Next, we need to check if the 'on - air date' for the transmitter location represented by this row (mount canobolas) is before 30 December 1989. In this case, the on-air date for mount canobolas is 30 December 1989, which is not before the given date.\n\n3. Since the 'on - air date' for mount canobolas is not before 30 December 1989, it follows that the transmitter location that have a digital power of 570 kw and air before 30 december 1989 is not mount canobolas.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'digital power' is 570 kw\",\n    \"Check if the 'on - air date' for each identified location is before 30 December 1989\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"on - air date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"digital power\" }\n  ]\n}",

We will look for a row where both the 'ch 1' column has the value '39 (UHF)' and the 'on - air date' is later than '30 December 1989'.\n\nWith this reasoning, we can inspect the table and find the relevant cells:\n- Relevant cell 1: Row index = 1, Column name = region served\n- Relevant cell 2: Row index = 1, Column name = ch 1\n- Relevant cell 3: Row index = 1, Column name = on - air date\n\nNow that we have identified the relevant cells, let's verify if the claim is true or false based on their values.
