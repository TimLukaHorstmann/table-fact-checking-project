Find the row corresponding to March 6 in the table: In the table, the date \"march 6\" appears in the first column of the third row.\n\n3. Check the team in the home column for the row with date \"march 6\": The team in the home column (third column) for the row with date \"march 6\" is Philadelphia.\n\n4. Compare the team mentioned in the claim with the team found from step 3: Montreal is not the team found in step 3, but it was the team that visited Philadelphia on March 4 and March 11.

    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n1. Identify the date when Montreal was a visitor based on the table. The first column, 'date', indicates the team's opponent for each row, not the visiting or home team. Therefore, I need to find a row where Montreal is listed as the opponent (home team).\n2. Since the first row has Philadelphia as the visitor, I move to the second row to check if Montreal is the home team. In this row, the opponent is Philadelphia, which indicates that Montreal is indeed the home team in this game, so they were not the visitors on March 1.\n3. I continue checking each subsequent row for a match where Montreal is the opponent, which occurs on the sixth row (March 6). However, since this was the first time I found Montreal as an opponent, it means that before March 6, Montreal was never the visitor.\n4. The claim asks for 'before march 6', so I check if there is a match where Montreal is the opponent before the date given (March 6). Since the sixth row is the first time Montreal is listed as the opponent, it means that before March 6, Montreal was never the visitor.\n\nHere's my final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date when Montreal was a visitor by finding rows where Montreal is listed as the opponent.\",\n    \"Since the first row has Philadelphia as the visitor, check the second row for a match with Montreal as the home team.\",\n    \"On the sixth row (March 6), find a match where Montreal is the opponent, but since this was the first occurrence of Montreal as an opponent, it means that before March 6, Montreal was never the visitor.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
