    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the criteria for the claim: no bronze medal with more than 1 medal total and fewer than 1 silver medal and a rank of 8.\n2. Iterate through the table row by row to find a match for the given criteria.\n3. Start from the bottom (row 10) and work our way up as the ranking decreases, since the claim's rank is 8.\n4. Check if the number of bronze medals is greater than 1: for any given country, if the bronze column value is greater than 1, move to the next row without considering that country further.\n5. Check if the number of silver medals is fewer than 1: for any given country, if the silver column value is less than 1, move to the next row without considering that country further.\n6. If a match is found, the claim is FALSE; otherwise, if no match is found and we've examined all rows, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the criteria for the claim\", \"Iterate through the table row by row\", \"Start from the bottom (row 10)\", \"Check if bronze > 1 and silver < 1 for each country\", \"If a match is found, the claim is FALSE; otherwise, if no match is found and we've examined all rows, the claim is TRUE\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
