    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we analyze the table to understand what values each column represents. The 'position', 'name', 'played', 'drawn', 'lost', and 'points' columns represent their respective names.\n\n2. Next, we note that the 'sg (n)' team has a drawn value of 0 in the table, which means they did not have a draw with a number larger than zero.\n\n3. Now, we need to check if any team positioned higher than 3 ('lost' values) can be found among those who lost games.\n\n4. We see that 'ec amberg', 'ec erkersreuth', and 'erc ingolstadt' are the teams with a position larger than 3 (position 1, 3, and 4 respectively).\n\n5. Checking their respective 'lost' values: ec amberg has 0 lost games, which contradicts our earlier observation that 'sg (n)' did not have a draw with a number greater than zero and a team positioned higher than them had no losses.\n\n6. Moving on to 'ec erkersreuth', we see they had 4 lost games, which again contradicts the claim as there is a team positioned higher than 'sg (n)' that has lost more games than 'sg (n)'.\n\n7. Lastly, 'erc ingolstadt' had 5 lost games. This also contradicts the claim since there exists a team with a position larger than 'sg (n)' that has lost more games.\n\n8. Since all teams positioned higher than 'sg (n)' have either won or drawn games, and 'sg (n)' didn't win any games due to having no points, it is impossible to find any team with a position larger than 3 that also had more losses than 'sg (n)'.\n\nThe final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze the table and determine what each column represents\",\n    \"Note that 'sg (n)' has no draws\",\n    \"Check if any team positioned higher than 3 has lost games\",\n    \"Determine if any of those teams have more losses than 'sg (n)', which has zero points\",\n    \"Confirm there are no such teams\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\" }\n  ]\n}",
