Find all ships in the table: List all the ships from the first column of the table (ships column). In this case, ['l\u00fctzow', 'derfflinger', 'seydlitz', 'k\u00f6nig', 'markgraf']\n\n3. Identify the round size for which we are looking: In this case, we are looking for 13.5 inch rounds.\n\n4. Check each ship to see how many times it was hit with the specified round size (13.5 inches):\n   - For 'l\u00fctzow', there is no entry in the table corresponding to 13.5-inch / 1400lb, so it was not hit by such a round.\n   - For 'derfflinger', there is no entry for either 13.5-inch / 1400lb or 13.5-inch / 1250lb, so it was not hit by a 13.5 inch round.\n   - For 'seydlitz', there are no entries corresponding to the specified round size (13.5 inches), so it was not hit by such a round.\n   - For 'k\u00f6nig', there is an entry of 7 in the row corresponding to 13.5-inch / 1400lb, indicating that it was hit by 7 rounds of this size.\n   - For 'markgraf', there are no entries corresponding to the specified round size (13.5 inches), so it was not hit by a 13.5 inch round.\n\n5. Count the number of ships hit with 13.5 inch rounds: In this case, we found only one ship ('k\u00f6nig') that was hit by 7 rounds of this size.\n\n6. Check if the 'k\u00f6nig' was the only ship hit with a 13.5 inch round: In this case, there is only one ship ('k\u00f6nig') that was hit by 13.5 inch rounds, fulfilling the condition that it should be the only ship hit by such a round.\n\nFinal answer (in JSON format):\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim: The 'k\u00f6nig' was hit by 7 rounds with a 13.5 inch size and was the only ship hit with such a round.\", \"List all ships in the table\", \"Identify the round size for which we are looking\", \"Check each ship to see how many times it was hit with the specified round size (13.5 inches)\", \"Count the number of ships hit with 13.5 inch rounds\", \"Check if 'k\u00f6nig' was the only ship hit with a 13.5 inch round\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}",
