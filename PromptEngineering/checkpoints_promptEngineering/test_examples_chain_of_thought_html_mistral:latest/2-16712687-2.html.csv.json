The given table indicates that this match occurred on week 7 and row index 7 corresponds to this game.\n\n2. Next, find the attendance for the game. In the same row (row_index 7), check the fifth column which contains the attendance value.\n\n3. Compare the obtained attendance with the given claim. If the attendance matches the one given in the claim, then the answer is TRUE.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify row where opponent is Cleveland Browns and result is l 20 - 17\", \"Find attendance for this game by checking the fifth column in the corresponding row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
