    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the queen for whom we need to find the spouse. In this case, it's the queen whose 'became queen' cell has the earliest date (since she was married before becoming a queen). The relevant row is the third one, with the queen named \"maria teresa of the two sicilies\".\n\n2. Find the spouse of the identified queen. The spouse's name can be found in the 'spouse' column of the relevant row. In this case, it's \"francis ii\".\n\n3. Determine if the identified queen's father is indeed \"ferdinand i of the two sicilies\". This information is in the 'father' column of the relevant row.
