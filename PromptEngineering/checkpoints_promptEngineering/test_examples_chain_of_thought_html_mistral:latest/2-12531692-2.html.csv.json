Look for these names in the table to find out their teammates:\n   - Susana Z\u00e9 Maria is in the same row as Riquita and others, so her teammates are Ricardo V, Ricardo A, Maria Jo\u00e3o, S\u00f3nia, Carla, Paulo, Marta, M\u00e1rio, Telmo, Celia.\n   - Susana Telmo's exact name is not listed in the table, but it can be assumed that she is also included in the same team as Telmo, since they are considered one \"team\" by the way the table is structured (they share a row). So her teammates would be Ricardo V, Ricardo A, Maria Jo\u00e3o, S\u00f3nia, Carla, Paulo, Marta, M\u00e1rio, Z\u00e9 Maria, Celia.\n3.

Find out who plays Paulo: To find out which team member plays Paulo, we look for rows where Paulo is listed as the \"riquita.\" This will help us identify the team that he interacts with.\n3. Match the identified players with their respective teams: Since the table indicates that RV and no6 belong to different teams (as they are not in the same row), we need to find out which team each of them is on. By looking at the \"all housemates\" row, we can see that RV interacts with Marco Ricardo V Telmo, while no6 interacts with C\u00e9lia Ricardo a Z\u00e9 Maria.\n4. Compare the teams: If Richardo V's team plays against the team of the player who plays Paulo, then it implies that Richardo V does not play Paulo directly. However, if we find that their teams do not overlap (i.e., no member from Richardo V's team is also in the team of the player who plays Paulo), then it means Richardo V could potentially have a match with Paulo on another team or in a different context.\n5. Check for any connections between the teams: To verify our hypothesis, we look for common members between Richardo V's team and the team that plays Paulo. If no such connection is found, then it supports the claim that \"Richardo V be the no6 team that have no6 play Paulo.\"\n\nFinal answer (in JSON format):\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify individuals: Richardo V and no6\",\n    \"Find out who plays Paulo by looking at the 'riquita' column\",\n    \"Match players with their respective teams\",\n    \"Compare teams to determine potential matches between them\",\n    \"Check for any connections between the teams\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"riquita\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"all housemates\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
