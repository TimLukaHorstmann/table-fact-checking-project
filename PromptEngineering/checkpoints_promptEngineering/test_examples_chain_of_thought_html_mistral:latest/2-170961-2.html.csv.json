    "resp": "1. Examine the table to understand its structure, noting that each row represents a different parish, with columns for official name, status, area (in km^2), population, and census ranking.\n\n2. Note that the claim mentions four specific census rankings: 1184 of 5008, 1402 of 5008, 1666 of 5008, and 2105 of 5008.\n\n3. To verify the claim, we need to find the parishes that have an area smaller than 200 square km (since no area is provided for simonds, it will not be considered in this analysis). By scanning the table, we observe that all areas are greater than 100 square km but less than 500 square km.\n\n4. Since the claim refers to the census ranking of parishes with an area smaller than 200 square km, we need to find these parishes and compare their census rankings mentioned in the claim. By examining the table, we notice that kent (1184 of 5008), brighton (1402 of 5008), and richmond (1666 of 5008) have areas smaller than 200 square km. We cannot confirm whether aberdeen (2105 of 5008) has an area smaller than 200 square km, as its area is not provided in the table.\n\n5. To verify the claim, we will compare the census rankings of the parishes found in step 4 with their actual positions in the table. We observe that kent (1184), brighton (1402), and richmond (1666) are located at their respective row indices 1184, 1402, and 1666 in the census ranking column. These values match the ones provided in the claim.\n\n6. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the census rankings mentioned in the claim (1184 of 5008, 1402 of 5008, and 1666 of 5008) do correspond to parishes with an area smaller than 200 square km. However, we cannot confirm whether the census ranking mentioned for aberdeen (2105 of 5008) matches a parish with an area smaller than 200 square km since its area is not provided in the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine the table structure.\",\n    \"Identify the claim's specific census rankings and areas.\",\n    \"Find parishes with an area smaller than 200 square km.\",\n    \"Compare the census rankings of found parishes with their actual positions in the table.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim holds for kent, brighton, and richmond; cannot confirm for aberdeen.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"census ranking\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"area km 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"census ranking\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"area km 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"census ranking\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
