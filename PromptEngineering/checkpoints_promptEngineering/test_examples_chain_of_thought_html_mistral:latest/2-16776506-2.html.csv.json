For the first row, it does not meet the criteria as the date and location do not match the claim.\n3. For the second row, it does not meet the criteria as the surface is grass, which is not a hard surface.\n4. For the third row, it meets the date and location criteria but the opponent is not Mirielle Dittmann. However, it does show that Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in Wellington, New Zealand on 6 February 2000.\n5. For the fourth row, it does not meet the surface criteria as the surface is hard and the opponent is not Mirielle Dittmann.\n6. For the fifth row, it does not meet the date or location criteria.\n7. For the sixth row, it meets the date and location criteria but the opponent is not Mirielle Dittmann. However, it does show that Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in Wellington, New Zealand on 6 February 2005, which means she was not the opponent in Wellington, New Zealand on 6 February 2000.\n8. For the seventh row, it meets the surface criteria as the surface is hard. However, it does not meet the date or location criteria.\n9. For the eighth row, it does not meet the surface criteria as the surface is hard and the opponent is not Mirielle Dittmann.\n10. For the ninth row, it meets the surface criteria as the surface is hard. However, it does not meet the date or location criteria.\n11. For the tenth row, it meets the date and location criteria but the surface is not hard.\n12. The eleventh row (row 3) meets the condition that Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in Wellington, New Zealand on a hard surface on 6 February 2000.
