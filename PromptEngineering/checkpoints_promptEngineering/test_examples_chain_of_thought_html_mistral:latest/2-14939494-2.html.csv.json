    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the storm names that correspond to the 2010 Pacific Hurricane Season. The season ranges from May 29 to December 21 are specified in the table, so any storm active within this period can potentially be part of this season.\n\n2. Next, we look up the rows in the table that have dates falling within the specified range (May 29 - December 21). From the table, we see the following storms fall within this range: Agatha, Two-E, Blas, Celia, Darby, Six-E, Estelle, Eight-E, Frank, Ten-E, Eleven-E, Georgette, and Omeka.\n\n3. Now we need to find the rows corresponding to Hurricane Agatha and Hurricane Blas. We do this by comparing their storm names with the names of the storms we identified in step 2. In our case, Agatha is on row 1 and Blas is on row 3.\n\n4. Finally, we compare the \"deaths\" column values for Hurricane Agatha (row 1) and Hurricane Blas (row 3). If the value in row 1 (190) is greater than the value in row 3 (0), then our claim is true.\n\nOutput:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify storms within specified season range, locate Hurricane Agatha and Blas, compare deaths\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"}\n  ]\n}",
