We find that the first match occurred on September 11th, 2007 and the last match on September 18th, 2007.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I need to identify the players in the table who have more than one row. This will help me determine if any player has been a part of two different partnerships (i.e., two different teams).\n2. In this table, there is only one player with multiple rows: \"Jehan Mubarak\". He appears in rows 7 and 8.\n3. I need to examine the partnership column for each row where Jehan Mubarak is listed (rows 7 and 8) to see if the same partnership appears in both rows, as that would indicate he was part of two different teams.\n4. In row 7, Jehan Mubarak's partnership is with \"gayan wijekoon\", while in row 8, his partnership is with \"chaminda vaas\". These two partnerships are not the same, so they represent different teams.\n5. To confirm that he was part of the team that got the 7th place (row 7), I need to check the wicket column for that row and ensure it has a value. In this case, Jehan Mubarak's partnership in row 7 has the wicket value \"45\".\n6. To confirm that he was part of the team that got the 8th place (row 8), I need to check the wicket column for that row and ensure it has a value as well. In this case, Jehan Mubarak's partnership in row 8 also has a wicket value \"40\".\n7.
