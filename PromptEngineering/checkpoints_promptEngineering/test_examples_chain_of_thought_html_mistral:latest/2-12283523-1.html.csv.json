For year 1863, the second member is also William Gore - Langton, but since the information provided in the table does not include parties for all years, we cannot compare the parties directly. However, based on the previous data (years before and after 1863), it can be inferred that William Gore - Langton and Sir Alexander Fuller - Acland - Hood, BT were part of the same Conservative party as they are listed together in multiple years.\n\n4.
