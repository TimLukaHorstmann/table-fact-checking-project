    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I am checking the row corresponding to Kazakhstan (kaz) in the table. The row with the 'nation' value of \"Kazakhstan (kaz)\" is the 5th row.\n2. Next, I am looking at the 'gold' column for this nation, which has a value of 0 in the corresponding cell of this row.\n3. Since the number of gold medals for Kazakhstan is 0, the claim that \"gold be not smaller than zero\" is FALSE.\n4. However, even though the gold count is zero, it does not imply that the total medal count will be zero. That's because the table shows other medals (silver and bronze) as well.\n5. To check whether the total number of medals for Kazakhstan is more than zero, I need to examine the cells in the 'total' column corresponding to this nation. The row_index is 5 and the column_name is \"total\".\n6. In the cell at row 5 and column 'total', the value is 2 (since silver + bronze = 2). So the total number of medals for Kazakhstan is more than zero.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check gold count for Kazakhstan, see if it's not smaller than zero\", \"If gold count is zero, check if total medal count is more than zero\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]\n}",
