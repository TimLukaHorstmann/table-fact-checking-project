To verify if Alex Caffi's 0 lap total was due to an electrical issue and Philippe Streiff's 0 laps were due to an accident, we will look for rows corresponding to these drivers.\n3. If the notes in the table mention \"electrical\" or \"engine\" issues for Alex Caffi, it would suggest that his 0 laps were indeed due to an electrical issue.\n4. Similarly, if the notes in the table mention \"accident\" or \"disqualified\" for Philippe Streiff, it would indicate that his 0 laps were caused by an accident.\n5. After checking the relevant cells, we will compare our findings with the claim and determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\n   Answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Check the table for Alex Caffi's row to find out if there was an electrical issue mentioned\",\n       \"Check the table for Philippe Streiff's row to see if an accident or disqualification was mentioned\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"td\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"td\" }\n     ]\n   }",
