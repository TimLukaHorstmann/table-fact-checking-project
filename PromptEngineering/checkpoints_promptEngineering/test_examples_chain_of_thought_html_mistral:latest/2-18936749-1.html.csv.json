Check for common counties - We see that Bremen and Culver Community are both from 50 Marshall (3rd column), so they might belong to the same conference. However, their IHSAA classes are different (4th column). In order to confirm whether they belong to different conferences, we need to check if schools in the same county can have different IHSAA classes within the same conference.\n3. Check for consistency - In the table, there are six schools with different IHSAA classes within the same county (50 Marshall and 71 St Joseph).
