Search for any data in the table that corresponds to a match between Denver Nuggets (the home team of the Pepsi Center) and Philadelphia 76ers, which is the visiting team mentioned in the claim. Since the table contains all games played in December 2008, we should look for games played during this period.\n   3.

Examine the \"Attendance\" column (column 5) of the identified row to verify whether it matches the attendance figure given in the claim (19155). Yes, the attendance value for this game is indeed 19155.\n   5.
