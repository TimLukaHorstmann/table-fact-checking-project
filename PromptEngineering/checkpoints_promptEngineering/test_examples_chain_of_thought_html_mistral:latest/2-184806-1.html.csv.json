Find the column representing the language: In the provided table, the 'language' column (column 2) indicates the language of each artist.\n3. Filter the rows by language: To determine if German artists placed in 4 different spots, we need to filter out only the rows with 'german' as the value in the 'language' column.\n4. Count the unique values in the filtered 'place' column: If there are 4 unique places among the German artists (excluding ties), it would indicate that they placed in 4 different spots.\n5. Compare the count with the required number: If the count is equal to or greater than 4, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n6. Extract the relevant cells: To verify our findings, we will need to examine the 'language' and 'place' columns of the German artists.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the column representing the language\", \"Filter the rows by language\", \"Count the unique values in the filtered 'place' column\", \"Compare the count with the required number\", \"Extract the relevant cells\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
