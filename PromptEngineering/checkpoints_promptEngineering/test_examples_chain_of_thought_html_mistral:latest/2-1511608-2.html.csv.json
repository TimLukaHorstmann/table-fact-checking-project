Identify the claim's components: The claim consists of two parts, the first part states that there is a row where net profit/loss is -114000000 and basic EPS is -6.58. The second part states that the employee (average / year) in that row should be larger than 31034.\n\n2. Search for the relevant row: Since the net profit/loss of -114000000 is given in the table, I can easily find the corresponding row by searching for it vertically (by the value of the 4th column). In this case, the row with index 11 matches the first part of the claim.\n\n3. Check if the basic EPS is -6.58: To verify the first part of the claim, I need to confirm that the value in the 5th column (basic eps) for the selected row is indeed -6.58. In this case, it is (- 6.58).\n\n4. Check if employee (average / year) is larger than 31034: To verify the second part of the claim, I need to confirm that the value in the 3rd column (employees) for the selected row is larger than 31034. In this case, it is (31035).\n\n5.
