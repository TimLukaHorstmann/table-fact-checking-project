Compare the values in the 'points per game' and 'rebounds per game' columns with the given numbers (23.8 and 15.0) for each season: In this table, there is only one row where both conditions (points per game = 23.8 and rebounds per game = 15.0) are satisfied.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there is a season where the blocks per game (bpg) are 2.4, and during that same season, the field goal percentage (FG%) is 594 (which is actually a FG% value rather than an average of bpg).\n\n2. Look for seasons: The table provides different seasons in each row under the \"season\" column. We have to find a season where the FG% matches with 594 and check if that same season has 2.4 bpg.\n\n3. Compare each season with the provided values:\n   - Row 1, Season: 2005-06 (1 / 1), FG%: 531, bpg: 0.7\n   - Row 2, Season: 2006-07 (1 / 1), FG%: 576, bpg: 1.9\n   - Row 3, Season: 2007-08 (1 / 2), FG%: 618, bpg: 2.7\n   - Row 4, Season: 2007-08 (2 / 2), FG%: 598, bpg: 2.9\n   - Row 5, Season: 2010-11 (1 / 2), FG%: 594 (which is in the second column, not the fourth as required by the claim), bpg: 2.4\n\n4. Find a match: In row 5, we see a season where both FG% matches and bpg almost matches with the provided values. However, the claim requires that they occur during the same season. Since the FG% value in row 5 is in the wrong column (it should be under points per game), this season does not meet the requirements of the claim.\n\n5. Final answer: The claim is FALSE since it asks for a season where both the blocks per game and field goal percentage match, but the provided values do not occur during the same season.\n\nHere's my output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: there be 2.4 block per game during the season where the field goal percentage be 594 (2nd)\",\n    \"Look for seasons and compare each season with provided values\",\n    \"No match found as the FG% value in row 5 is not under the correct column\",\n    \"Final answer: FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
