Identify relevant rows: We need to find the row(s) where both the school and the high school are Stanford and Lessburg respectively.\n3. Check each player's high school: Compare each player's hometown/high school with \"Lessburg High School\". If a match is found, move on to check if the college is also Stanford.\n4. Check each player's college: Compare each player's college with \"Stanford\". If both the high school and the college match for a player, then that player is the one we are looking for.\n5. Output the final answer: Based on our comparison, if we find a player who meets the criteria, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this question would be { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"hometown\" } and { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\" } as those are the columns containing the information we compared to verify the claim.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify relevant rows\",\n    \"Check each player's high school\",\n    \"Check each player's college\",\n    \"Output the final answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"hometown\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Stanford has a linebacker from Norco High School.\n\n2. Determine the relevant data columns: To verify the claim, we will focus on the \"player\" and \"school\" columns since they provide information about the players' names and their respective colleges/universities.\n\n3. Examine the table rows: Iterate through each row of the table to find a player from Norco High School who attends Stanford.\n\n4. Identify matching data: In the third row, we can see that \"noor davis\" is a linebacker from \"lessburg high school\". Since \"lessburg\" and \"norco\" might not be the same due to potential spelling errors or differences in how schools are officially named, we cannot confirm the claim yet.\n\n5. Cross-reference information: To further validate the claim, check for additional instances of players from Norco High School in the table. No other matching data is found.\n\n6. Draw a conclusion based on the given evidence: Since there's only one player (Noor Davis) who might have attended Norco High School and does not attend Stanford, we cannot confirm that Stanford has a linebacker from Norco High School with certainty. However, it can be said that the claim is not definitively true based on the provided information.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the relevant data columns\",\n    \"Examine the table rows\",\n    \"Identify matching data\",\n    \"Cross-reference information\",\n    \"Draw a conclusion based on the given evidence\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
