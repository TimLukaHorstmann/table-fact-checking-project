In the provided table, the seasons are represented along the columns. We need to find the \"1987 - 88\" season.\n2. Locate the row corresponding to Newell's Old Boys in the table. The team can be identified by its name.\n3. Check the points scored by the team in the \"1987 - 88\" season. In the table, each season's points are represented in the column labeled with that season's name.\n\nThe answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the season for which we are looking for points scored by Newell's Old Boys.\",\n    \"Locate the row corresponding to Newell's Old Boys in the table.\",\n    \"Check the points scored by the team in the '1987 - 88' season.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"1987-88\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Chain of thought:\n1. Identify the years for which the points are given. The points are provided for 3 seasons: 1986-1987, 1987-1988, and 1988-1989. Since we are looking for a point of 107 in the season 1987-1988, we only need to focus on that year.\n2. To find the total points scored in the 1987-1988 season, we can scan the table row by row and look for the corresponding season's data (column \"Year\" is not provided but we can identify it based on the order of the seasons).\n3. In the table, each row represents a team, and columns represent the points scored during different seasons. We are looking for the points scored in the 1987-1988 season, which corresponds to the third column for most teams (as the first two columns represent the points scored in previous seasons).\n4. Scroll through the table until we reach the row with the team name \"Platense\". In that row, we can see the points scored during the 1987-1988 season, which is 98 (in the third column of the Platense row).\n5. Since the number provided (107) is greater than the points scored by Platense during the 1987-1988 season (98), there must be at least one team that scored more than 107 points in the 1987-1988 season.\n6. However, since we are only examining the given table and do not have information about other teams' performances outside this table, we cannot definitively say whether there is a team with 107 or more points during the 1987-1988 season.\n7. In conclusion, while it is possible that a team scored 107 or more points during the 1987-1988 season (as suggested in the claim), based on the available information, we cannot confirm this fact with certainty.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the years for which the points are given and focus only on the relevant year. 2. Look for the points scored in the relevant year (1987-1988) for each team, as each row represents a team and columns represent seasons. 3. Scroll through the table and find the points scored by Platense during the 1987-1988 season. 4. Compare the given number (107) with the points scored by Platense to determine if it is possible for a team to score more than 107 points in that year. 5. Since we are only examining the provided table and do not have information about other teams' performances, we cannot definitively confirm whether there is a team with 107 or more points during the 1987-1988 season.\",\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Year\" }, { \"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"1987-1988\" } ]\n}",
