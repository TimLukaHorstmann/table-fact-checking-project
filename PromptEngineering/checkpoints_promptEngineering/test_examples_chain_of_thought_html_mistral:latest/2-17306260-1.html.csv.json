No such criteria are mentioned, so we'll assume that a team qualifies if they have the highest aggregate score across both legs.\n4. Compare the aggregate score of energia czarni slupsk with the other teams in the table (since we don't know the total number of teams or their scores without further information, we cannot make an absolute determination). However, since the score of energia czarni slupsk is lower than several teams, it seems likely that other teams may have a higher aggregate score.\n5. We can't definitively determine if energia czarni slupsk has qualified based on this table alone because we lack context about the total number of teams and their scores.

Now that we know Triumph played against Telindus Oostende, we need to check if there was a score difference greater than or equal to 68 and less than or equal to 71 between their two matches (1st leg and 2nd leg).

Identify the column that represents the aggregate score of the teams - In this case, it's the second column with the header \"agg\".\n4. Check the value in the cell corresponding to the team and the \"agg\" column. The value for 'energa czarni slupsk' is '136 - 151'.\n5. Identify the teams that will be compared based on aggregate scores - Since we are looking for the lowest score, all other teams in the table should also be considered.\n6. Locate the cells for these teams and their aggregate scores:\n   - Row 1: '\u0161iauliai' with '136 - 167'\n   - Row 2: 'amsterdam' with '133 - 146'\n   - Row 3: 'energa czarni slupsk' with '136 - 151' (already identified)\n   - Row 4: 'swans allianz' with '146 - 139'\n   - Row 5: 'panellinios' with '154 - 124'\n   - Row 6: 'triumph' with '146 - 159'\n   - Row 7: 'ask riga' with '142 - 137'\n7.

However, it does have a lower score than several other teams including 'amsterdam' (133-146), 'swans allianz' (146-139), 'panellinios' (154-124), 'triumph' (146-159), and 'ask riga' (142-137).\n8. Determine the final answer - The claim is that \"energa czarni slupsk lose qualification due to lowest score\".
