    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure and see which columns are relevant. The table has columns for outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. Each row seems to represent a different event or tournament.\n\nThe claim mentions \"hwang sun\" as the partner. Looking at the table's 'partner' column, I can check if \"kang haeng - suk\" is paired with \"hwang sun\" in any of the tournaments listed.\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, the partners are mostly \"kang haeng - suk\" and the events are things like world championships, asian games, etc. There's no mention of a partner named \"hwang sun\". So maybe I need to see if there's any instance where the partner is someone else or if \"kang haeng - suk\" is paired with different people.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Partner is \"kang haeng - suk\", event is world championships, year 1985. It says outcome is 3, which I assume means number of times? But the claim is about \"hwang sun\", not kang haeng-suk.\n\nRows 1 and 2 have partners as asian games or other open tournaments, but again, no mention of hwang sun.\n\nRow 3: Partner is kang haeng - suk in an India Open in 1985 with outcome 1. So that's another instance where kang haeng - suk is the partner.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament.\" It seems to suggest that hwang sun was partnered three times with kang haeng-suk in tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, I don't see any entries where the partner is both \"kang haeng - suk\" and \"hwang sun\". Each row has either one of them or other events. So there's no instance where they are both listed as partners.\n\nTherefore, the claim is likely false because the table doesn't show hwang sun being partnered with kang haeng-suk three times.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. Let me break down the claim first: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1985 world championship in calgary , canada.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has columns for outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. The rows list different events, years, venues, and partners. \n\nI need to check each part of the claim against the table. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"hwang sun.\" Looking at the 'partner' column in the table, I see entries like \"kang haeng - suk.\" There's no mention of \"hwang sun\" anywhere in the partner column. So that might be a red flag because if Hwang Sun is supposed to be the partner, they should appear in the partner column.\n\nNext, the claim says this happened for the first time at the 1985 world championship in Calgary, Canada. Let's look at the table for events and partners in 1985. In row index 0, the outcome is \"world championships,\" event is \"world championships,\" year 1985, venue is \"calgary , canada,\" and partner is \"kang haeng - suk.\" So that row has the world championships in 1985 in Calgary with Kang Haeng as the partner.\n\nBut wait, the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng. However, the table shows Kang Haeng alone as the partner in that specific event. There's no mention of Hwang Sun being a partner in any row, which might mean that either the claim is incorrect because Hwang Sun isn't listed, or perhaps there's another instance where both are partners.\n\nLooking at other rows: Row 1 mentions the Asian Games in 1982 with Kang Haeng as the partner again. Row 3 also has the same partner. There's no row where both Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng are listed as partners together.\n\nSo, the claim might be false because it incorrectly states that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 world championship when in reality it was only Kang Haeng. Additionally, there's no mention of Hwang Sun being a partner in any event.\n\nAnother point: The claim specifies \"for the first time.\" The table shows events starting from 1982 and onwards. In 1985, Kang Haeng is already listed as a partner, so if Hwang Sun was present, they might have started partnering after that, but there's no evidence of it in the table.\n\nAlso, the venue in the claim is Calgary, Canada, which matches row index 0 in the table for 1985. But since the partner isn't Hwang Sun, this further supports that the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo putting it all together: The table shows that Kang Haeng was a partner at the 1985 world championship in Calgary, but doesn't mention Hwang Sun as a partner. Therefore, the claim's assertion about Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me break down the claim and compare it with the table step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"in 1982, hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman's double event, finish first, 1 of 2 time she win an event with kang haeng.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the year mentioned in the claim. It's 1982. So I need to find any entries in the table for the year 1982.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"year\", the years listed are:\n- world championships: 1985\n- asian games: 1982\n- other open tournaments: 1985\n\nSo, there is an entry for 1982, which corresponds to the asian games. That's a relevant cell because the year matches.\n\nNext, I'll check the event mentioned in the claim. It says \"asian game\" and specifically mentions the \"double woman's double event.\" The table has a row for \"asian games,\" but it doesn't specify the exact event or type of event like \"double woman's double.\" So this might be less relevant, but I'll note it.\n\nNow, looking at who participated. The claim says \"hwang sun.\" In the table, under the \"partner\" column for 1982, the partner is listed as kang haeng - suk. Wait, the name in the table is \"kang haeng - suk,\" not \"hwang sun.\" That's a discrepancy. So if the participant is \"hwang sun,\" but the table shows \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner, then this part might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again. The column for 1982 in \"partner\" says kang haeng - suk, not hwang sun. So that's a problem because the claim mentions hwang sun as the participant, but according to the table, it was kang haeng - suk who participated with kang haeng.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. The table seems to have columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. For 1982, the event is asian games, year is 1982, venue is new delhi, india, and partner is kang haeng - suk.\n\nThe claim says hwang sun participated in the asian game in a specific event, but the table shows that the partner was kang haeng - suk. So unless \"hwang sun\" is another name for \"kang haeng - suk,\" which I don't think is the case, this might be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the roles here. The claim says Hwang Sun participated as a participant, but in the table, \"partner\" refers to the partner she played with, right? So if the event is doubles, then both participants would be listed. But in the table, for 1982, the partner is kang haeng - suk. So perhaps the other participant is Hwang Sun.\n\nWait, that might make sense. If the event is a double woman's event, then there are two participants, and their partners are listed. So perhaps Hwang Sun was partnered with kang haeng - suk in 1982 at the asian games. So the claim is correct in saying Hwang Sun participated, but the table lists her partner as kang haeng - suk.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in the double woman's double event,\" so both participants would be women doubles players. The table just lists the partner, which might mean one of them, but I'm not sure if it's specified. So perhaps Hwang Sun is the other participant.\n\nBut the key issue is that the table shows kang haeng - suk as the partner in 1982 for the asian games. The claim refers to Hwang Sun as the participant, which seems correct, so maybe the only discrepancy is the name.\n\nWait, but if \"partner\" in the table refers to the other participant in a doubles event, then yes, the claim correctly identifies that Hwang Sun participated with kang haeng - suk.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"1 of 2 times she win an event with kang haeng.\" So it's saying this was one of two occasions where she won an event with Kang Haeng. Looking at the table, in 1985 and 1982, kang haeng - suk is listed as partner.\n\nIn 1982, outcome is 1 (probably meaning she won?), but I'm not sure what the numbers represent. The first row shows world championships with outcome 3, then wd (maybe a win?).\n\nWait, perhaps the \"outcome\" column indicates the placement or result. Let's look:\n\n- For 1985: outcome 1, partner kang haeng - suk.\n\nIn 1982: outcome 1 as well. So in both years, she won once with kang haeng - suk.\n\nSo if the claim says that in 1982, Hwang Sun participated in the asian game doubles event and finished first, which is correct because outcome is 1, then it's TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the partner in 1982 is listed as kang haeng - suk. So perhaps \"she\" refers to kang haeng - suk, but the claim says hwang sun. That would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Hwang Sun is the other participant, so when the claim says \"in the double woman's double event,\" it's correct that both participated, and the partner is listed as kang haeng - suk.\n\nBut then the claim refers to Hwang Sun as the one participating, which aligns with her being partnered with kang haeng - suk. So outcome 1 would mean she won that event, and it was one of two times she won an event with kang haeng - suk. In 1982 and 1985, both times kang haeng - suk is the partner.\n\nSo in 1982, Hwang Sun participated as a doubles partner with kang haeng - suk, and they finished first (outcome 1). Then in 1985, same thing but in other tournaments.\n\nThus, the claim seems to be TRUE because all these conditions are met: year 1982, asian games, outcome 1, partnered with kang haeng - suk. So relevant cells would be the 1982 row and the partner column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the table for the year 1982, where Hwang Sun participated in the asian games as a partner with kang haeng - suk, resulting in first place. This aligns with the claim's details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1985 india open finish first 2 year after win the asian game.\" \n\nLooking at the table, it's in markdown format, and I see several columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. Each row represents a different event with details.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to see what each part means. The claim mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open. It also says this was after winning the Asian Games two years prior. So, the timeline here is that the Asian Games win happened two years before the India Open.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll look for any entries where the partner is either Hwang Sun or Kang Haeng and the event is the 1985 India Open, as well as any related Asian Games wins around 1983-1984 (since two years before 1985 would be 1983).\n\nStarting with the 1985 India Open: In the table, under year 1985, I see an entry for \"other open tournaments\" where the venue is \"india open.\" The partner listed here is Kang Haeng - Suk. So that's one point in favor of the claim.\n\nNow, checking for any Asian Games wins by Hwang Sun or Kang Haeng around 1983-1984. In the table, I see an entry for the Asian Games in 1982 with a partner of Kang Haeng - Suk and it resulted in 1. If that's a win (since outcome is 1), that would mean they won the Asian Games in 1982. That fits because two years after 1982 is 1984, but the claim mentions 1985. Wait, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me check again: The claim says \"finish first 2 year after win the asian game.\" So if they won the Asian Games in 1982, then two years later would be 1984, but the India Open mentioned is in 1985. Hmm, that doesn't align. Unless there's another Asian Games entry closer to 1983 or 1984.\n\nLooking again at the table, I see another row for \"asian games\" with a year of 1982, which is when they won. So that would mean two years after 1982 is 1984. But the claim refers to the 1985 India Open, which is one year after 1984.\n\nWait, perhaps the partner is Hwang Sun in another event. Let me check all entries where partner is Kang Haeng - Suk or Hwang Sun.\n\nIn the first row of the table, outcome is world championships, but it's not relevant here. Then, for the Asian Games in 1982, partner is Kang Haeng - Suk. Then, for the India Open in 1985 under \"other open tournaments,\" partner is again Kang Haeng - Suk. \n\nWait, so Hwang Sun isn't mentioned as a partner in any of these entries except perhaps elsewhere? Let me check all rows.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: outcome is world championships, event same, year same, venue same, partner same.\n- Row 1: outcome is 3 with wd (maybe that's a typo), but partner is Kang Haeng - Suk in 1985 at Calgary, Canada.\nWait, the first three rows seem to have \"world championships\" as the event and outcome, but row 2 has Asian Games. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list each row:\n\nRow 0: outcome, event, year, venue, partner:\n- world championships\n- world championships\n- world championships (year)\n- calgary, canada\n- kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 1: \n- 3\n- wd\n- 1985\n- calgary, canada\n- kang haeng - suk\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Maybe the first row is for something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured with each row representing a different competition type, like world championships, Asian Games, and other open tournaments.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFirst three rows seem to be under \"world championships\" as outcome, but then row 3 is about other open tournaments. So maybe the structure is that there are multiple competitions per year.\n\nWait, perhaps the table isn't structured correctly. Let me try to parse it more carefully.\n\nThe first three rows (indices 0-2) have outcome as world championships, event same, and so on. Then row 3 seems different, with outcome being \"other open tournaments\" etc., but I think there might be a mistake in how the table is presented because in markdown tables, each column should align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first three rows are for World Championships, then the fourth row is for Asian Games, and so on. Let me try to parse it again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- outcome: world championships\n- event: world championships\n- year: world championships (year)\n- venue: calgary, canada\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nThen next rows:\n\n1. 3 | wd | 1985 | calgary, canada | kang haeng - suk\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Maybe the first row is header and then data starts from second.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is misaligned. Let me try to parse it as a markdown table properly.\n\nIn markdown, the headers are outcome, event, year, venue, partner. Then each row after that has the respective data.\n\nSo, the first data row would be:\n\n- \"3\"\n- \"wd\"\n- \"1985\"\n- \"calgary , canada\"\n- \"kang haeng - suk\"\n\nThen next row:\n\n- \"1\"\n- \"wd\"\n- \"1982\"\n- \"new delhi , india\"\n- \"kang haeng - suk\"\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the table has multiple entries for different events and years.\n\nSo, in this structure, each row is a separate event with its details.\n\nNow, looking back at the claim: Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open, two years after winning the Asian Games.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an entry for the 1985 India Open where the partner is Hwang Sun or Kang Haeng. Looking through the table:\n\n- In row 1 (row index 1), year is 1982, event Asian Games, partner Kang Haeng.\n- In row 4 (assuming it's the fourth data row after headers), which would be index 3, the event is \"other open tournaments,\" venue India Open, year 1985, partner Kang Haeng.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions Hwang Sun as the partner. So I need to check if any row has Hwang Sun as the partner in the 1985 India Open.\n\nLooking through the table, only row 3 (index 3) shows the 1985 India Open with partner Kang Haeng - Suk. There's no mention of Hwang Sun here.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because it says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng, but according to the table, it was Kang Haeng partnering with someone else in that event.\n\nAdditionally, checking if there's a win in the Asian Games by either Hwang Sun or Kang Haeng around 1983-1984 (two years before 1985). The only Asian Games entry is in row index 2: outcome is 1, which might indicate a win. But who won it? The partner is Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nSo the claim says \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng...\" but according to the table, in the Asian Games of 1982, Kang Haeng partnered and won (outcome 1). In the 1985 India Open, Kang Haeng was partnered by someone else, not Hwang Sun.\n\nMoreover, Hwang Sun isn't mentioned as a partner in any row except possibly elsewhere. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is longer, but in the given snippet, it's only up to 1985.\n\nSo, based on this:\n\n- In 1982 Asian Games: Kang Haeng partnered with someone else and won (outcome 1).\n- In 1985 India Open: Kang Haeng partnered again with someone else (not Hwang Sun), leading to an outcome of 3.\n\nThus, the claim that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng in 1985 is incorrect because it's Kang Haeng partnering with another person. Also, there's no mention of Hwang Sun as a partner at all in the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the statement is false based on the information from the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open is incorrect. According to the table, Kang Haeng was partnered by someone else in both the 1982 Asian Games and the 1985 India Open. There is no evidence of Hwang Sun being a partner in any event listed.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; the 1985 India Open entry shows Kang Haeng partnering with someone other than Hwang Sun.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"With her partner Kang Haeng, Hwang Sun finished in the top 3 at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and map it to the table. \n\nThe claim mentions three things:\n1. Partner is Kang Haeng.\n2. Finished in the top 3.\n3. At least 3 different venues between 1982 and 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the partner is Kang Haeng - Suk and the year is either 1982, 1983, 1984, or 1985. Also, check if the outcome (result) is within top 3. \n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row 1: Outcome is 3, Partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, Year 1985, Venue Calgary, Canada.\n- Row 2: Outcome is 1, Partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, Year 1982, Venue New Delhi, India.\n- Rows for Asian Games and other tournaments have different partners (Asian Games) or outcomes not top 3.\n\nSo, in the relevant rows where partner is Kang Haeng - Suk and outcome is top 3 (which is 3), we have two entries: one in 1982 (outcome 1) which doesn't count because it's not top 3, but wait no, actually, looking back, I think I misread. Wait, the first row has outcome as 'world championships' with value 3, and partner Kang Haeng - Suk, year 1985. The second relevant row is 1982 with outcome 1.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify: for each event type, the outcome column might represent a specific result, but in this context, perhaps it's indicating that they finished within top 3? Or maybe the number represents their placement, so 3 means third place, which is top 3. \n\nSo in the first relevant row (row 0): outcome is 'world championships' with value 3, partner Kang Haeng - Suk, year 1985, venue Calgary. So this counts as a finish in top 3 at that event.\n\nSecond relevant row: row 1 has outcome as 'asian games' with value 1. Wait, but the column for outcome is labeled as 'outcome', and the values are things like 'world championships', 'asian games', etc. So perhaps the numbers after these labels indicate their placement? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, looking back, the table has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. The first row's outcome is 'world championships' and the value is 3. Maybe that indicates they participated in the world championships and finished 3rd. Similarly, row 1's outcome is 'asian games' with a value of 1. So perhaps the number represents their placement in that event.\n\nSo for Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng - Suk:\n\n- In 1985 (row 0), they participated in the world championships as a pair and finished 3rd, which is top 3.\n- In 1982 (row 1), they participated in the asian games and finished 1st.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"top 3 at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" So they need to have 3 different venues where they finished in top 3.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1982: venue New Delhi (asian games), outcome 1. But outcome is 1, which might mean they won, so that's a top finish but not necessarily part of \"top 3\" as per the claim? Or does it count since 1st is also top 3?\n\nWait, the claim says \"finished in the top 3,\" and 1st place is considered top. So their finishes would be:\n\n- 1982: 1st at asian games.\n- 1985: 3rd at world championships.\n\nBut that's only two different events/venues where they finished in top places. But the claim says \"at 3 different venues.\" \n\nWait, looking back, there are three rows where partner is Kang Haeng - Suk:\n\nRow 0: 1985, world championships, Calgary, 3\nRow 1: 1982, asian games, New Delhi, 1\nAnother row at the bottom: other open tournaments in 1985, India Open, outcome 1. But here, partner is Kang Haeng - Suk? Wait, no, looking at the table:\n\nWait, the last row has:\n\n- outcome: other open tournaments (so event name)\n- value: 1\n- year: 1985\n- venue: India open\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo that's another entry where they finished 1st in an other open tournament.\n\nWait, but in the table, the third row (row index 2) is:\n\nother open tournaments | other open tournaments | 1985 | india open | kang haeng - suk | 1\n\nSo that's three rows where partner is Kang Haeng - Suk:\n\n- Row 0: world championships, Calgary, 3\n- Row 1: asian games, New Delhi, 1\n- Row 2: other open tournaments, India Open, 1\n\nWait, but I think the initial table may have more than three rows. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the markdown table:\n\n| outcome                | event                  | year                   | venue                  | partner                |\n|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|\n| world championships    | world championships    | world championships    | world championships    | world championships    |\n| 3                      | wd                     | 1985                   | calgary , canada       | kang haeng - suk       |\n| asian games            | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            |\n| 1                      | wd                     | 1982                   | new delhi , india      | kang haeng - suk       |\n| other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments |\n| 1                      | wd                     | 1985                   | india open             | kang haeng - suk       |\n\nWait, that's only four rows after the header. So:\n\nRow 0: world championships, 3, 1985, Calgary, Kang Haeng\nRow 1: asian games, 1, 1982, New Delhi, Kang Haeng\nRow 2: other open tournaments, 1, 1985, India Open, Kang Haeng\n\nSo that's three entries where partner is Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nNow, checking if each of these events are at different venues:\n\n- Row 0: Calgary\n- Row 1: New Delhi\n- Row 2: India Open (which I assume is a different venue than the others)\n\nThus, they have three different venues: Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open.\n\nEach of these, their outcomes are:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (third place)\n- Row 1: 1 (first place)\n- Row 2: 1 (first place)\n\nSo in each of these three events, they finished within the top 3. Therefore, the claim is that with her partner Kang Haeng, Hwang Sun finished in the top 3 at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\n\nLooking at the years:\n\n- Row 0: 1985\n- Row 1: 1982\n- Row 2: 1985\n\nWait, two of them are in 1985. So does that matter? The claim says \"from 1982 to 1985,\" which is a four-year period, and they have finishes in 1982, 1985, and another 1985.\n\nBut the venues are three different ones: Calgary (1985), New Delhi (1982), India Open (1985). So it's over the span of 1982-1985, and at three different venues, she finished in top 3. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nSo I think the answer would be that all three entries are within the timeframe and at different venues with top finishes.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis confirms that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng - Suk achieved top finishes at three distinct venues between 1982 and 1985:\n\n1. **1985 World Championships in Calgary**: They finished third (3rd place).\n2. **1982 Asian Games in New Delhi**: They won first place.\n3. **1985 Other Open Tournaments in India Open**: They also won first place.\n\nEach of these events occurred within the specified timeframe and at different venues, fulfilling the conditions outlined in the claim.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng - Suk finished in the top three at three different venues between 1982 and 1985.",

Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"hwang sun partner with asian game 5 time at tournament.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Asian Games five times at tournaments. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify if there are any entries that match this description. The columns in the table are outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts:\n1. Partner's name: Hwang Sun\n2. Event type: Asian Games\n3. Number of times: 5\n4. Context: tournaments\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nStarting with Row 0:\n- outcome: world championships\n- event: world championships\n- year: 1985\n- venue: Calgary, Canada\n- partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n\nDoes this relate? The partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, not Hwang Sun. So no match here.\n\nRow 1:\n- outcome: asian games\n- event: asian games\n- year: 1982\n- venue: New Delhi, India\n- partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n\nAgain, the partner isn't Hwang Sun. So this doesn't fit either.\n\nRow 2:\n- outcome: other open tournaments\n- event: other open tournaments\n- year: 1985\n- venue: India Open\n- partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n\nNo match here as well.\n\nRow 3:\n- outcome: other open tournaments\n- event: other open tournaments\n- year: 1985\n- venue: India Open\n- partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n\nSame as above, no Hwang Sun mentioned.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Asian Games five times. Looking at Row 1, the outcome is asian games and the partner is Kang Haeng - Suk. But the partner in this row isn't Hwang Sun. So it's not a match.\n\nI'm trying to see if any row has \"Asian Games\" as the event with Hwang Sun as the partner. From the table provided, none of the rows list \"Hwang Sun\" as the partner. The only partners mentioned are Kang Haeng - Suk across multiple events and tournaments.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table that supports the claim about Hwang Sun partnering with Asian Games five times at tournaments. \n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what's being claimed and then compare it with the data in the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 1985 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman 's double event , finish second , 2 of 3 time she win an event with kang haeng\"\n\nBreaking this down, I'll look at each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the year is 1985. Looking at the table, there are two entries for 1985. The first one is in row 1, which mentions \"world championships\" as both outcome and event, held in Calgary, Canada, with partner Kang Haeng - Suk. The second 1985 entry is under \"other open tournaments\" in row 3, held in India Open, same partner.\n\nNow, the claim mentions the Asian Games, specifically the double woman's double event. In the table, I need to check if there's an Asian Games event in 1985 with Hwang Sun as a participant. The first two rows are about world championships and Asian Games respectively. Let's see: row 0 is for world championships, not Asian Games. Row 1 is for Asian Games in 1982, but that's in 1982, not 1985.\n\nRow 3 is other open tournaments, which isn't the Asian Games either. So there's no entry for Asian Games in 1985. That might be a problem because the claim mentions 1985 and Asian Games.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The table has three main outcome types: world championships, Asian Games, and other open tournaments. For each of these, there are entries with year, venue, partner, etc.\n\nLooking at the Asian Games row (row index 1), the event is \"asian games,\" but the year is 1982 in that row. So in 1982, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games as a partner with Kang Haeng - Suk, finishing first. But the claim is about 1985.\n\nIs there any entry for Asian Games in 1985? Let me check all rows again. The third row (index 3) refers to other open tournaments in 1985. So no, there's no row that says \"asian games\" with year 1985.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be incorrect because it mentions Hwang Sun participating in the Asian Games in 1985, but according to the table, she only participated in the Asian Games in 1982 and in other tournaments in 1985, not the Asian Games again that year. Also, the partner is correct as Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nWait, the claim says \"2 of 3 time she win an event with kang haeng.\" Let me check if she won twice out of three times with Kang Haeng. Looking at the table:\n\n- In 1985 (row 1), she participated in world championships and finished 3rd.\n- In 1982 (same row as Asian Games), she won first.\n- In 1985 again (row 3), she participated in other tournaments, which was also a win (1st place).\n\nSo total of two wins: 1982 and 1985. Therefore, the claim's statement about \"2 of 3 times\" might be inaccurate because there are only two wins mentioned, not three events.\n\nWait, but in row 1, it says outcome is 1 for Asian Games, so she won that event. Then in row 3, other open tournaments, outcome is also 1, another win. So total of two wins with Kang Haeng - Suk: correct.\n\nBut the claim says \"in 1985, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Game...\" but according to the table, there's no Asian Games event in 1985; the last Asian Games was in 1982.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect because she didn't participate in the Asian Games in 1985. Instead, she participated in other open tournaments that year. So the claim's date and event don't match.\n\nAdditionally, about the finish: the claim says she finished second, but looking at the table, when she participated in world championships in 1985 (row 0), her outcome was 3, which I think means she came third. In the Asian Games in 1982, she finished first. So if the claim is referring to a different event, maybe it's incorrect.\n\nPutting it all together: the table doesn't support the claim that Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1985. Instead, she was in other tournaments that year. Also, there are only two wins with Kang Haeng - Suk, not three as implied by \"2 of 3.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the table shows Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1982, not 1985, and she won twice with Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1982 world championship in the india open.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into its components. Let's see:\n\n1. **partners** - Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng.\n2. **event** - 1982 World Championship.\n3. **venue** - India Open.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row seems to represent a specific event with details like outcome, event name, year, venue, and partner. \n\nLet me examine the rows one by one:\n\n- **Row 0**: Outcome is \"world championships\", Event is \"world championships\", Year is 1985, Venue is \"calgary, canada\", Partner is \"kang haeng - suk\".\n  \n  This doesn't match the claim because it's from 1985 and the venue is Calgary, not India Open.\n\n- **Row 1**: Outcome is \"asian games\", Event is \"asian games\", Year is 1982, Venue is \"new delhi, india\", Partner is \"kang haeng - suk\".\n  \n  This seems relevant. The event is asian games in 1982 at New Delhi. But the claim mentions \"world championship,\" which this isn't.\n\n- **Row 2**: Outcome is \"other open tournaments\", Event is \"other open tournaments\", Year is 1985, Venue is \"india open\", Partner is \"kang haeng - suk\".\n  \n  This matches the venue and partner but the event is not world championships; it's other open tournaments.\n\nWait, the claim mentions the 1982 World Championship at the India Open. In row 1, it's 1982 Asian Games at New Delhi. So that's different. In row 2, the year is 1985 and the venue is India Open but the outcome is \"other open tournaments.\" \n\nSo, looking for a 1982 World Championship event at India Open with partners Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng.\n\nBut in the table:\n\n- The first row has world championships, 1985, Calgary. No.\n- Row 1: Asian Games, 1982, New Delhi. Partners are both Kang Haeng - suk, but event isn't World Championship.\n- Row 3: Other tournaments, 1985, India Open, partner is Kang Haeng.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table columns. Let me check again.\n\nThe columns are outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nSo for each row:\n\nRow 0:\noutcome: world championships\nevent: world championships\nyear: 1985\nvenue: calgary, canada\npartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 1:\noutcome: asian games\nevent: asian games\nyear: 1982\nvenue: new delhi, india\npartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 2:\noutcome: other open tournaments\nevent: other open tournaments\nyear: 1985\nvenue: india open\npartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 3 seems to be a header or something since the outcome and event columns have \"other open tournaments\" as their values.\n\nWait, no. The first row is all world championships? Let me check the markdown again:\n\nThe table starts with:\n\n| outcome                | event                  | year                   | venue                  | partner                |\n|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|\n| world championships    | world championships    | world championships    | world championships    | world championships    |\n| 3                      | wd                     | 1985                   | calgary , canada       | kang haeng - suk       |\n| asian games            | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            |\n| 1                      | wd                     | 1982                   | new delhi , india      | kang haeng - suk       |\n| other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments |\n| 1                      | wd                     | 1985                   | india open             | kang haeng - suk       |\n\nWait, so the first row seems to be headers. Because outcome is \"world championships,\" event same, year same, etc. Then each subsequent row has data.\n\nSo the actual data rows are:\n\nRow 0:\noutcome: 3\nevent: wd (maybe short for world championship?)\nyear: 1985\nvenue: calgary, canada\npartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 1:\noutcome: 1\nevent: wd\nyear: 1982\nvenue: new delhi, india\npartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 2:\noutcome: other open tournaments (but that's a header)\nWait no, the first row is headers:\n\n- outcome: world championships\n- event: world championships\n- year: world championships\n- venue: world championships\n- partner: world championships\n\nBut then the data starts with row 0 as outcome:3, etc.\n\nSo, let me consider that the table has two sections: the header and then three rows of data.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0:\noutcome:3 (maybe the number of medals or something)\nevent:wd\nyear:1985\nvenue:calgary, canada\npartner:kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 1:\noutcome:1\nevent:wd\nyear:1982\nvenue:new delhi, india\npartner:kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 2:\noutcome:other open tournaments (but that's a header)\nWait, perhaps the table is misaligned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row after the header represents different events:\n\nFirst data row:\nOutcome:3\nEvent:wd\nYear:1985\nVenue:calgary, canada\nPartner:kang haeng - suk\n\nSecond data row:\nOutcome:1\nEvent:wd\nYear:1982\nVenue:new delhi, india\nPartner:kang haeng - suk\n\nThird data row:\nOutcome:other open tournaments\nEvent:other open tournaments\nYear:1985\nVenue:india open\nPartner:kang haeng - suk\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the partner is kang haeng - suk in both 1982 and 1985 events.\n\nNow, the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1982 World Championship in the India Open.\n\nLooking for a row where:\n\n- Year: 1982\n- Venue: India Open\n- Partner: kang haeng - suk\n- Event: world championship (or wd as per table)\n\nBut in the second data row, year is 1982, venue is new delhi, not India Open. So that's different.\n\nIn the third data row, event is \"other open tournaments,\" so not world championship, and venue is India Open but the event is other tournaments.\n\nSo there's no row where:\n\n- Year:1982\n- Venue:India Open\n- Event:World Championship (wd)\n- Partner:kang haeng - suk\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because in 1982, Hwang Sun was at New Delhi, not India Open. The first partnership was also in 1985 at Calgary.\n\nWait, but let's check if \"India Open\" is a venue. In row 3 (third data row), the venue is \"india open,\" so that's the only occurrence of India Open.\n\nBut the event there is \"other open tournaments,\" not world championship or asian games.\n\nSo in 1982, at New Delhi, Hwang Sun was partnered with Kang Haeng for Asian Games. But the claim says 1982 World Championship at India Open.\n\nSince neither the 1982 World Championship nor India Open have both partners as Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng together, the claim is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be where 1982 event was in New Delhi, but that doesn't match the claim. So no data row matches the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1982 World Championship in the India Open. \n\nAfter analyzing the provided table:\n\n1. The only event at the India Open was in 1985, not 1982.\n2. In 1982, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games at New Delhi, not a World Championship.\n3. There is no data indicating that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng were paired together in the India Open or in a World Championship event.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The table has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. Each row seems to represent a different competition, with various details filled in. My task is to check if each part of the claim matches the data in this table.\n\nThe claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1982 new delhi , india finish first 2 year after win the world championship.\"\n\nLet me parse this claim into its components:\n\n1. Hwang Sun partners with Kang Haeng.\n2. This happened at the 1982 New Delhi, India event.\n3. They finished first two years after winning the world championship.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify what \"finish first 2 year after win the world championship\" means. It could mean that in the following two years after their world championship victory, they achieved this finish. Or perhaps it's a typo and should be \"first place\" each of the next two years. I'll assume it's the latter because finishing first for two consecutive years makes more sense.\n\nNow, let me go through each part of the claim against the table.\n\nFirst, check if Hwang Sun is indeed partnered with Kang Haeng in any event listed in the table. Looking at the 'partner' column:\n\n- Row 0: kang haeng - suk\n- Row 1: kang haeng - suk\n- Rows 2 and 3 also mention kang haeng - suk.\n\nWait, the claim refers to \"Hwang Sun\" as the partner. But in all the table entries, the partners are listed as \"kang haeng - suk\". There's no mention of a partner named Hwang Sun. So this part might not match. Unless there's a typo or I'm misunderstanding the name.\n\nWait, perhaps \"hwang sun\" is another name for kang haeng? Or maybe it's a misprint in the claim. Let me check the table again. The partners are all \"kang haeng - suk\". So if the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng, that might not be accurate because there's no entry where Hwang Sun is the partner. Therefore, this could make the claim FALSE.\n\nBut I need to verify each part step by step.\n\nSecond, check the year: 1982 New Delhi, India. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: event 'asian games', venue 'new delhi , india', year 1982.\n- The partner is kang haeng - suk.\n\nSo in 1982, the Asian Games were held in New Delhi, and Kang Haeng-Suk was the partner. But Hwang Sun isn't mentioned as a partner here. So the event in question is the 1982 Asian Games.\n\nThird part: finish first two years after winning the world championship.\n\nLooking at the table, when did they win the world championships? Let's see:\n\n- Row 0: outcome 'world championships', year 1985.\n- Partner is kang haeng - suk.\n\nSo in 1985, they won the world championships. Now, we need to check if in the next two years (1986 and 1987), they also finished first.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The only other entries are for 1982 and another entry for 1985 for the India Open.\n\nWait, let me list all the years in the table:\n\n- 1985: world championships, India Open\n- 1982: Asian Games\n\nSo after their victory in 1985, the next two years would be 1986 and 1987. But the table doesn't have any entries for those years. The only other entry is the 1985 India Open.\n\nTherefore, there's no data to support that they finished first in 1986 and 1987. So this part of the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's not about the next two years after 1985, but within the same year? Or maybe the event in question is the Asian Games in 1982, which was two years before their world championship victory in 1985. That doesn't fit either because the claim says \"after win the world championship\".\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The partner is kang haeng - suk, not Hwang Sun.\n- The event in question is the 1982 Asian Games, not a world championship.\n- There's no evidence they finished first two years after their 1985 victory because those years (1986, 1987) aren't in the table.\n\nTherefore, each part of the claim doesn't match the data. So the overall claim should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I misread something.\n\nLooking again at the partner column: all entries are kang haeng - suk. No Hwang Sun. Therefore, the first part is incorrect.\n\nThe event in 1982 was the Asian Games, not a world championship or any other open tournament where they might have won and then finished first in subsequent years.\n\nSo yes, the claim is making incorrect statements based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The table has several columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. \n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"with her partner kang haeng , hwang sun finish first at 3 different venue from 1982 to 1985.\" So, I need to check if Hwang Sun, along with Kang Haeng, finished first in three different venues between 1982 and 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, let's break it down. The rows seem to represent different events or competitions. Each row has values for outcome (1st, 3rd), event name, year, venue, and partner. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0:\n- Outcome: world championships\n- Event: world championships\n- Year: 1985\n- Venue: Calgary, Canada\n- Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n\nSo in 1985, at the World Championships in Calgary with partner Kang Haeng, Hwang Sun finished first. That's one venue.\n\nRow 1:\n- Outcome: asian games\n- Event: asian games\n- Year: 1982\n- Venue: New Delhi, India\n- Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n\nHere, she also finished first at the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1982. That's the second venue.\n\nRow 2:\n- Outcome: other open tournaments\n- Event: other open tournaments\n- Year: 1985\n- Venue: India Open\n- Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n\nThis is another first-place finish, at the India Open in 1985. That makes it the third venue.\n\nSo between 1982 and 1985, there are three instances where Hwang Sun finished first with her partner Kang Haeng at different venues. Wait, but let me check the years: 1982, 1985, and another one? The table has three rows that fit the criteria.\n\nWait, the third row is also in 1985, so maybe she had two finishes in 1985. But does that count as three different venues? Yes, because each venue is distinct: Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open. So she finished first at three different venues within those years.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the table data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]}",
