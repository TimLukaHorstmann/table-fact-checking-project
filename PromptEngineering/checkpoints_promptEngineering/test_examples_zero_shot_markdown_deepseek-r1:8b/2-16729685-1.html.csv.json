    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"artist maggie toal have draw 7 for the song fee him with love.\" So, I need to find if there's an entry in the table where all these pieces fit together correctly.\n\nLooking at the table columns: draw, artist, song, points, place. The relevant parts of the claim are about the 'artist', 'draw number', and 'song title'.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to see if any match these criteria.\n\nStarting from row 1: draw is 1, artist is \"the memories\", song is \"if it means losing you\". Doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: draw is 2, artist is \"ann breen\", song is \"oh , darling\". No match.\n\nRow 3: draw is 3, artist is \"fran meen\", song is \"say that you love me\". Nope.\n\nRow 4: draw is 4, artist is \"dreams\", song is \"sin sin (that 's that)\". Not matching.\n\nRow 5: draw is 5, artist is \"connor stevens\", song is \"count on me\". No.\n\nRow 6: draw is 6, artist is \"linda martin and friends\", song is \"all the people in the world\". Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 7: draw is 7, artist is \"maggie toal\", song is \"feed him with love\". Wait, that matches exactly what the claim says. So this row has all the information needed to verify the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
