    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be the only player to score 8 goals in the league.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this claim are probably 'name' and 'league', since it's about a specific player scoring a certain number of goals in the league.\n\nLooking at the 'name' column, bok\u0161i\u0107 is listed first, with 8 goals under the 'league' column. Now, I need to check if any other players have 8 or more goals in the 'league' column. If someone else has 8 or more, then the claim would be FALSE because it says \"the only player.\"\n\nGoing through each row:\n- bok\u0161i\u0107: 8 goals\n- whelan: 4\n- n\u00e9meth: 3\n- ince: 2\n- cooper: 2\n- queudrue: 2\n- marinelli: 2\n- mustoe: 2\n- deane:1\n- johnston:1\n- greening:1\n- stockdale:1\n- festa:1\n- windass:1\n- southgate:1\n- carbone:1\n- ehiogu:1\n- murphy:0\n- wilson:0\n- cambell:0\n- own goals:1 (but that's not a player, so we can ignore this)\n\nSo, no other players have 8 or more goals in the league. Therefore, bok\u0161i\u0107 is indeed the only one with 8 goals. \n\nWait, but I should double-check if 'own goals' count towards the total or the league column. Looking at the table headers: 'league', 'fa cup', etc., and the own goals are under a separate row. So, it's just 1 in own goals, which isn't tied to any player. Thus, only bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 in the league.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because no other player has scored 8 goals in the league.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in the fa cup.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. My focus is on the 'fa cup' column because the claim is about goals scored in the FA Cup.\n\nLooking through each row, I need to find out if any other players have 3 goals in the FA Cup. \n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107: fa cup is 0.\n- Whelan: fa cup is 3. That's one player with 3 goals.\n- N\u00e9meth: fa cup is 1.\n- Ince: fa cup is 1.\n- Cooper: fa cup is 0.\n- Queudrue: fa cup is 0.\n- Marinelli: fa cup is 0.\n- Mustoe: fa cup is 0.\n- Deane: fa cup is 0.\n- Johnston: fa cup is 0.\n- Greening: fa cup is 0.\n- Stockdale: fa cup is 0.\n- Festa: fa cup is 0.\n- Windass: fa cup is 0.\n- Southgate: fa cup is 0.\n- Carbone: fa cup is 0.\n- Ehiogu: fa cup is 0.\n- Murphy: fa cup is 0.\n- Wilson: fa cup is 0.\n- Cambell: fa cup is 1.\n- Own goals: fa cup is 1.\n\nFrom this, only Whelan has 3 goals in the FA Cup. No other player besides him has 3 goals. So the claim says he's the only one, which seems true based on the table.\n\nI should identify the relevant cells. The row for Whelan is row index 1 (since it starts at 0) and the column is 'fa cup'. So the relevant_cells list will include this.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"marinelli score 1 more total goal than johnston\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant information in the table that pertains to both marinelli and johnston. Looking at the table, each row represents a player, and the columns are 'name', 'league', 'fa cup', 'league cup', and 'total'. The 'total' column seems to sum up all their goals in other competitions.\n\nSo, I need to find the rows for both marinelli and johnston. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- For marinelli, looking at the first column (name), I see \"marinelli\" is the 7th entry with row index 6 (since it's zero-based). The 'total' column here shows 2 goals.\n  \n- For johnston, I also need to find their row. Scanning through, I spot \"johnston\" in row 8 (if we consider starting from 0). Checking the 'total' for johnston, it's 1 goal.\n\nNow, the claim says that marinelli scores 1 more total goal than johnston. So, is 2 equal to 1 plus 1? Yes, because 2 = 1 + 1. That means marinelli has indeed scored one more total goal than johnston.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in locating the rows. Sometimes tables can be tricky with their order. Let's recount:\n\nStarting from row 0:\n1. bok\u0161i\u0107\n2. whelan\n3. n\u00e9meth\n4. ince\n5. cooper\n6. queudrue\n7. marinelli (row index 6)\n8. mustoe\n9. deane\n10. johnston (row index 8)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, marinelli has a total of 2 goals, and johnston has 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because 2 is exactly one more than 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim is: \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate Cambell and Ehiogu in the table to see their goals. Looking at the table, I see two entries that might be relevant here: Cambell and Ehiogu.\n\nStarting with Cambell. Scanning through the rows, I find Cambell listed under the \"name\" column. His row is number 13 (since it's the 14th entry if we count from zero). In his row, under the \"league cup\" column, it says 0. Wait, no, actually, looking back at the table, each player has a value in several columns: league, fa cup, league cup, and total.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again. The columns are \"name,\" \"league,\" \"fa cup,\" \"league cup,\" and \"total.\" So for each player, their data is across these five columns.\n\nLooking for Cambell: In the table, there's a row with name \"cambell\" (row index 13). His league entry is 0, fa cup is 1, league cup is 0, total is 1. Wait, so his goals in the league are 0? Or does the term \"score\" here refer to something else?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league.\" So it's about their goals in the league. Let me check both players' league column.\n\nCambell: In the league column, his entry is 0.\nEhiogu: Looking for Ehiogu in the table, I see row index 14 (since the list goes up to at least 15). Wait, let me count again:\n\nThe rows are:\n1. bok\u0161i\u0107\n2. whelan\n3. n\u00e9meth\n4. ince\n5. cooper\n6. queudrue\n7. marinelli\n8. mustoe\n9. deane\n10. johnston\n11. greening\n12. stockdale\n13. festa\n14. windass\n15. southgate\n16. carbone\n17. ehiogu\n18. murphy\n19. wilson\n20. cambell\n21. own goals\n\nWait, no, actually the table shows 21 rows because it includes \"own goals.\" So, Ehiogu is row index 17.\n\nLooking at Ehiogu's data: league column is 1, fa cup is 0, league cup is 0, total is 1. So in the league, Ehiogu scored 1 goal.\n\nCambell is row 20. His league entry is 0, so he scored 0 goals in the league.\n\nThe claim says Cambell scores 1 less than Ehiogu in the league. So if Ehiogu has 1, then Cambell should have 0 (since 0 = 1 -1). That seems correct because 0 is indeed one less than 1. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league.\" So Ehiogu scored X goals, Cambell scored X-1.\n\nEhiogu's league goals: 1\nCambell's league goals: 0\n\nYes, 0 is indeed one less than 1. So the claim is true based on these two players' data.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim mentions \"cambell\" and \"ehiogu,\" so their respective entries in the \"league\" column.\n\nSo for Cambell: row index 20, column is \"league.\"\nFor Ehiogu: row index 17, column is \"league.\"\n\nThus, the relevant cells are these two.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"league\"}, {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league\"}]}",

Looking at the table, I find that Marinelli also has a total of 2 goals. So far, so good.\n\nThen there's Mustoe. Checking the table again, Mustoe has 2 total goals. That's consistent with the claim as well.\n\nNow, Queudrue. I'll search for Queudrue in the table and see that they have 2 total goals too. This matches the claim on all four players.\n\nI don't see any other columns relevant here since we're only concerned with the 'total' column for these players.

Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim is: \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league.\" So, I'm looking at Bok\u0161i\u0107 and checking if he scored 8 goals in the league, and whether there are exactly two other players who also scored 8 goals each. \n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with several columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. For each player, their stats in each category are listed.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Bok\u0161i\u0107 in the table. Scanning down the \"name\" column, I see that Bok\u0161i\u0107 is at row index 0. His league goals are shown under the \"league\" column for that row, which has a value of 8. So, he scored 8 goals in the league.\n\nNext, the claim says he's one of three players who scored 8 goals. I need to check how many other players have 8 goals in the league.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim that \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in any competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Whelan is the sole player who has scored exactly three goals in any competition. So, I should look into the data provided in the table to verify if this is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The 'total' column likely represents the sum of goals scored across all competitions. So, for each player, their total goals would be the sum of their goals in the League and FA Cup (since League Cup has 0 entries except for a few).\n\nI'll start by locating Whelan's row. From the table:\n\n- **Name**: whelan\n- **League**: 4\n- **FA Cup**: 3\n- **League Cup**: 0\n- **Total**: 7\n\nWait, so according to this, Whelan has a total of 7 goals. The claim says he scored exactly three goals in any competition. But looking at his FA Cup column, it's 3, which would mean he scored three goals there. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut the next part is whether he's the only player with three goals. So I need to check all other players' total goals or individual competitions to see if anyone else has scored exactly three goals in any competition.\n\nLet me go through each player one by one:\n\n1. **Bok\u0161i\u0107**: League 8, FA Cup 0, Total 8.\n2. **Whelan**: League 4, FA Cup 3, Total 7.\n3. **N\u00e9meth**: League 3, FA Cup 1, League Cup 2, Total 6.\n4. **Ince**: League 2, FA Cup 1, Total 3.\n5. **Cooper**: League 2, FA Cup 0, Total 2.\n6. **Queudrue**: League 2, FA Cup 0, Total 2.\n7. **Marinelli**: League 2, FA Cup 0, Total 2.\n8. **Mustoe**: League 2, FA Cup 0, Total 2.\n9. **Deane**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n10. **Johnston**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n11. **Greening**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n12. **Stockdale**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n13. **Festa**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n14. **Windass**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n15. **Southgate**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n16. **Carbone**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n17. **Ehiogu**: League 1, FA Cup 0, Total 1.\n18. **Murphy**: League 0, FA Cup 0, League Cup 1, Total 1.\n19. **Wilson**: League 0, FA Cup 0, League Cup 1, Total 1.\n20. **Cambell**: League 0, FA Cup 1, Total 1.\n21. **Own Goals**: League 1, FA Cup 1, Total 2.\n\nNow, looking for players who have scored exactly three goals in any competition. Let's check each player:\n\n- Whelan: As above, he has 3 in FA Cup, so that's three goals in a competition.\n- N\u00e9meth: He has 3 in League (since 3+1+2=6), so that's also three goals in the league.\n- Ince: 2 + 1 = 3 total. So, he scored three goals in total, but how are they distributed? Does he have exactly three in any single competition?\n\nWait, from the table, Ince has League:2 and FA Cup:1, so total 3. But does he have a competition where he scored exactly three? No, because each competition (League and FA Cup) only shows his goals there. Since his League is 2 and FA Cup is 1, he didn't score three in any one competition.\n\nWait, the claim says \"to score 3 goal in any competition.\" So does that mean that Whelan scored exactly three in some competition, and no other player did so? Or does it mean each player scored at least three in some competition?\n\nLooking back, N\u00e9meth has 3 goals in League (from 3+1+2=6 total). So he scored exactly three in the league. Therefore, if Whelan is the only one who scored exactly three in any competition, then the claim would be FALSE because N\u00e9meth also did.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm:\n\n- Whelan: FA Cup:3 \u2192 yes.\n- N\u00e9meth: League:3 (from 3+1+2=6) \u2192 he has exactly three goals in League.\n\nSo both Whelan and N\u00e9meth have scored exactly three goals in a competition. Therefore, the claim that \"whelan be the only player\" is FALSE because N\u00e9meth also did.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"competition.\" Does each column represent a different competition? Like, League and FA Cup are two competitions, and League Cup another. So, for each player, their goals in each competition can be seen separately.\n\nSo, Whelan scored 4 in League and 3 in FA Cup. N\u00e9meth scored 3 in League, 1 in FA Cup, and 2 in League Cup. But the total is 6. So he scored exactly three in the League.\n\nTherefore, both Whelan and N\u00e9meth have scored exactly three goals in a competition (League for N\u00e9meth, FA Cup for Whelan). Therefore, the claim that Whelan is the only one to do so is FALSE because N\u00e9meth also did it.\n\nAdditionally, Ince has a total of 3, but he didn't score three in any single competition because his League was 2 and FA Cup 1. So his maximum in any competition is 2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Whelan's row: to confirm he scored exactly three in FA Cup.\n- N\u00e9meth's row: to show he also scored exactly three in League.\n\nSo, to check if this is correct, let's look again:\n\nWhelan: FA Cup 3 \u2192 so he scored three in a competition.\nN\u00e9meth: League 3 \u2192 he scored three in the league.\n\nThus, there are at least two players who have scored exactly three in a competition. Therefore, the claim that Whelan is the only one is incorrect.\n\nHence, the answer should be False, and the relevant data points are Whelan's FA Cup goals and N\u00e9meth's League goals.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that Whelan is the only player to score exactly three goals in any competition is **false**. Both Whelan and N\u00e9meth achieved this feat. \n\n- Whelan scored 3 goals in the FA Cup.\n- N\u00e9meth scored 3 goals in the League.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect as there are multiple players who have scored exactly three goals in a competition.\n\nThe relevant data points to consider are:\n\n1. **Whelan's FA Cup performance**: He scored 3 goals.\n2. **N\u00e9meth's League performance**: He scored 3 goals.\n\nThese two instances demonstrate that Whelan is not the sole player to achieve this, making the original statement false. \n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because N\u00e9meth also scored exactly three goals in a competition (League).",

Looking through the table:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107: total is 8.\n- Whelan: total is 7.\n- N\u00e9meth: total is 6.\n- Ince: total is 3.\n- Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue: each has 2.\n\nThen, other players like Deane, Johnston, etc., have a total of 1. So none of them have more than 1 goal except the four mentioned and Bok\u0161i\u0107 and Whelan, but wait, the claim says they are the only ones with 2 or more. But looking at 'own goals' column: 'own goals' has 2 in total.\n\nWait, does 'own goals' refer to players who scored their own goals? So, for example, if a player scored an own goal, that might be counted towards their total. The table includes an 'own goals' row with a total of 2. That suggests there are two players who have at least one own goal.\n\nBut the claim is about scoring 2 or more goals in general, not specifically own goals. So I need to see if any other players besides Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue have scored 2 or more goals in total.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107: 8\n- Whelan:7\n- N\u00e9meth:6\n- Ince:3\n- Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue:2 each\n- The rest (Deane, Johnston, etc.):1\n- Own goals: total 2, but it's a separate row.\n\nSo, are there any other players besides the four mentioned who have 2 or more? It seems not because all others except Bok\u0161i\u0107 and Whelan have either 1 or 0 in 'total'. But wait, Bok\u0161i\u0107 is at 8, which is way above. Does that mean only Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue, and Bok\u0161i\u0107/Whelan are the ones with more than 2 goals? No, because the claim says they are the only ones.\n\nBut the claim specifies \"cooper , marinelli , mustoe , and queudrue be the only player to score 2 or more goal.\" However, both Bok\u0161i\u0107 and Whelan have scored more than 2. So that would make the claim false because there are others besides those four who scored 2 or more.\n\nWait, but looking at the 'own goals' row, it's a separate entry. I think each player's total is in their own row, so own goals might not be part of their individual totals unless they have an additional column for it. But in this table, each player has their own row with columns for league, fa cup, etc., and 'total'.\n\nSo the four players mentioned (Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue) each have 2 total goals. Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8, Whelan has7, N\u00e9meth has6, Ince has3.\n\nThus, besides those four, Bok\u0161i\u0107 and others have scored more than 2. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are other players (like Bok\u0161i\u0107) who also scored more than 2 goals.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n\n- cooper: row 6, column 'total' is 2\n- marinelli: row 7, column 'total' is 2\n- mustoe: row 9, column 'total' is 2\n- queudrue: row 10, column 'total' is 2\n\nOther players like bok\u0161i\u0107 and whelan have higher totals than 2, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"marinelli and johnston score the same number of goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two names: marinelli and johnston. The key here is that both of them should have scored the same number of goals according to the table.\n\nI'll start by locating marinelli in the table. Scanning through the \"name\" column, I see marinelli's row. Looking at the relevant columns for goals, there's the 'league' and 'fa cup' columns, but those might not be goals; probably stands for league appearances or something similar. Then there's the 'league cup', which again might not be goals, and finally the 'total' column. Since the claim is about scoring goals, I'm guessing we're looking at either the 'league' or 'fa cup' as goals, but that needs clarification.\n\nWait, actually, maybe each of those columns represents different types of goals: league goals (like in the league matches), FA Cup goals, League Cup goals, and total goals. So, for each player, their total goals would be the sum of their league goals, FA Cup goals, and League Cup goals, but since only one of these is mentioned as 'total', perhaps the 'total' column is the actual total goals scored by each player.\n\nSo, I should check the 'total' column for both marinelli and johnston. Let's find their rows.\n\nStarting with marinelli: I see marinelli is in row 7 (since the table starts at row 0). Looking at her 'total' column, it says 2. So marinelli scored a total of 2 goals.\n\nNow, checking for johnston. Scanning down, I find johnston in row 11. His 'total' is also 1. Wait, that's different from marinelli's 2. That would mean their totals are different. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread the table.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. Maybe 'league' refers to goals scored in the league, 'fa cup' for FA Cup goals, and so on. So, perhaps each player's total goals are the sum of their 'league', 'fa cup', and 'league cup' columns? Let me check that.\n\nBut looking at the table, there's a separate 'total' column as well. So, for example, marinelli has 8 in league, 0 in fa cup, and her league cup is blank or zero (as per the markdown). Her total is 2. Wait, but in the table, under 'league', it's written as \"8\" for bok\u0161i\u0107, then numbers decrease. For marinelli, 'league' is 2, 'fa cup' is 0, and 'league cup' is 0, with a total of 2.\n\nWait no, looking at the markdown again: \n\n| name      |   league |   fa cup |   league cup |   total |\n|:----------|---------:|---------:|-------------:|--------:|\n...\n| marinelli |        2 |        0 |            0 |       2 |\n| mustoe    |        2 |        0 |            0 |       2 |\n...\n\nSo, for both marinelli and johnston, I need to check their 'league', 'fa cup', 'league cup' and sum them up if necessary. But since the table provides a 'total' column, perhaps that's the total goals scored.\n\nMarinelli's total is 2. Let me find johnston's row: looking at name column, I see johnston is in row 10 (if starting from 0). His 'league' is 1? Wait, no: looking again:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the table structure. The markdown shows each row with the player's name and then columns for league, fa cup, league cup, and total.\n\nFor example, bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 in league, 0 in fa cup, 0 in league cup, total 8.\n\nWait, but looking at marinelli's row: \"marinelli | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2\". So her total is 2.\n\nJohnston's row is listed as:\n\njohnson | ... Hmm, wait the table shows johnson? No, looking again: \n\nLooking through the list of names: bok\u0161i\u0107, whelan, n\u00e9meth, ince, cooper, queudrue, marinelli, mustoe, deane, johnston, greening, stockdale, festa, windass, southgate, carbone, ehiogu, murphy, wilson, cambell, own goals.\n\nWait, so johnston is at row 9 (if starting from 0). Let's check his 'total' column: it says 1. So marinelli has a total of 2, johnston has 1. Therefore, their totals are different. That would mean the claim that they scored the same number of goals is false.\n\nWait but let me make sure I didn't misread anything. Maybe the columns represent something else, not goals. But given the context, it's likely that 'total' refers to total goals scored.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'league', 'fa cup', and 'league cup' are separate categories, and their sum equals the 'total'. So for each player, league + fa cup + league cup = total.\n\nFor marinelli: 2 (league) + 0 (fa cup) + 0 (league cup) = 2 total. Correct.\n\nJohnston: Let me find his row again. Wait, in the table, johnson is at row 9? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait no, looking at the markdown:\n\n| name      |   league |   fa cup |   league cup |   total |\n|:----------|---------:|---------:|-------------:|--------:|\n| bok\u0161i\u0107    |        8 |        0 |            0 |       8 |\n| whelan    |        4 |        3 |            0 |       7 |\n| n\u00e9meth    |        3 |        1 |            2 |       6 |\n| ince      |        2 |        1 |            0 |       3 |\n| cooper    |        2 |        0 |            0 |       2 |\n| queudrue  |        ? Wait no, the next row is 'queudrue' perhaps. Let me count:\n\nAfter bok\u0161i\u0107 (row 0), whelan (1), n\u00e9meth (2), ince (3), cooper (4), queudrue (5), marinelli (6), mustoe (7), deane (8), johnston (9), greening (10), stockdale (11), festa (12), windass (13), southgate (14), carbone (15), ehiogu (16), murphy (17), wilson (18), cambell (19), own goals (20).\n\nSo, for each of these players, their totals are as per the 'total' column.\n\nJohnston is in row 9: his league, fa cup, etc. Let me check:\n\nLooking at row 9, which would be johnston's data. From the table, row 8 is deane with total 1, then row 9 is johnston with total 1.\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nAfter mustoe (7), comes deane (8: league 0, fa cup 0, league cup 0, total 0). Then johnston is row 9: his data would be:\n\njohnston |        1 |        0 |            0 |       1 |\n\nSo, total goals for johnston is 1.\n\nMarinelli's total is 2. Therefore, they have different totals. So the claim that they scored the same number of goals is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the columns. Maybe 'league' refers to something else, like appearances, not goals. But given that the column is labeled 'league', it's more likely related to goals.\n\nBut in that case, since marinelli has 2 and johnston has 1, their totals differ, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check each player's total as sum of the three columns:\n\nFor marinelli: league=2, fa cup=0, league cup=0 \u2192 total 2.\n\nJohnston: let me see his 'league', 'fa cup', and 'league cup' numbers. From row 9 (johnston), 'league'=1, 'fa cup'=0, 'league cup'=0, so sum is 1+0+0=1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, their totals are different, making the statement incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Marinelli and Johnston scored the same number of goals is false because Marinelli scored a total of 2 goals while Johnston scored only 1 goal.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false.",
