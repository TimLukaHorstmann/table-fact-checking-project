    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Iowa being the team that Jam Vanderberg belongs to when his completion status is redshirt is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"Iowa be the team that Jam Vanderberg belong to when the completion have a status of redshirt.\" The key points here are that Jam Vanderberg's completion status is redshirt and he's on the Iowa team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2008 to 2012, plus college totals. For each year, there's data on attempts, completions, completion percentage, and yards.\n\nI'll start by identifying if any of the years have \"redshirt\" as the completion status. Scanning through each row:\n\n- 2008: Completion is redshirt.\n- 2009: 87 attempts, 42 completions (48.3%).\n- 2010: 8 attempts, 5 completions (62.5%).\n- 2011: 404 attempts, 237 completions (58.7%).\n- 2012: 389 attempts, 223 completions (57.3%).\n\nThe \"completion %\" column shows the percentage completed. In the case of 2008, it's redshirt, which might mean that in 2008, Vanderberg was a redshirt, so he didn't play or didn't complete any passes.\n\nNow, looking at each row to see if Jam Vanderberg is part of Iowa in those years when his completion status is redshirt. \n\nWait, but the table doesn't mention players by name, only stats like attempts and completions. The \"team\" column says \"iowa\" for all these years except college totals. So in 2008, when completion is redshirt, the team is Iowa. Therefore, if Vanderberg was a player during that time with redshirt status, he would be part of the Iowa team.\n\nSo the claim seems to be supported by the data in row 0 (year 2008), where the completion status is redshirt and the team is Iowa.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those from the year 2008 when Jam Vanderberg's completion status was redshirt, as he was on the Iowa team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the Iowa team in 2010 is true based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"in 2010 , the player with iowa make 5 completion for a total of 45 yard.\" So, I need to verify if this statement accurately reflects any row in the table.\n\nThe table has the following columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The rows are from 2008 to 2012, plus college totals.\n\nI'll start by locating the year 2010. Scanning through the table, I see that the third row (index 2) is for 2010. Now, let's look at the team column for this row\u2014it says \"iowa,\" which matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check the completions and yards for this specific year. The completions in 2010 are listed as 5, and the yards are 45. That exactly matches what the claim states: 5 completions leading to a total of 45 yards.\n\nI should also make sure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. For example, if another row had the same numbers but for a different year or team, that would cause an issue. But in this case, only the 2010 row has 5 completions and 45 yards.\n\nSo, all relevant cells are:\n- The row index is 2 (since it's zero-based).\n- The columns are \"attempts,\" \"completions,\" and \"yards.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"completions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Team Iowa is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"team iowa have 42 completion.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table provided. It has several columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. Each row corresponds to a different year from 2008 to 2012, along with college totals.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"42 completion.\" That makes me think of the 'completions' column because that's where you'd find how many times a player completed passes or something similar. So, I should focus on the 'completions' cell for each relevant row.\n\nLooking at the table, Team Iowa has entries from 2009 onwards. Let me check each year:\n\n- In 2008: completions are listed as redshirt.\n- 2009: completions are 42.\n- 2010: completions are 5.\n- 2011: completions are 237.\n- 2012: completions are 223.\n- College totals: completions are 507.\n\nSo, the claim is about Team Iowa having 42 completions. Now, I need to see in which year this would be accurate. From the table, in 2009, completions are indeed 42. So that seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there aren't any other rows relevant here. The 'completion %' is a percentage rate, not the number of completions. So that column can be ignored for this particular claim. The same goes for attempts and yards; they don't directly relate to the number 42 in completions.\n\nAlso, the college totals row shows 507 completions overall, which is more than 42, but that's the total across all years, not a specific year's data.\n\nSo, the relevant cell would be the one in the 2009 row under the 'completions' column. That's where 42 is stated.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Team Iowa did have 42 completions in the 2009 season as per the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"team iowa have 42 completion,\" we need to check the relevant cells in the table for the year 2009 and the 'completions' column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that in the year 2009, Team Iowa had 42 completions.",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim seems to be saying that in a particular context (maybe within a specific year), there are 223 completions associated with 389 attempts. So, looking for a row where attempts are 389 and completions are 223.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- The table has columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, yards.\n- Each row represents a different year from 2008 to 2012, except for the last row which is \"college totals.\"\n\nSo I need to check each row's 'attempts' and 'completions' to see if any match 389 attempts and 223 completions.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n1. **2008**: Attempts = redshirt (which isn't a number), Completions = redshirt. So, irrelevant because they're not numerical values.\n2. **2009**: Attempts = 87, Completions = 42. Doesn't match.\n3. **2010**: Attempts = 8, Completions = 5. No match.\n4. **2011**: Attempts = 404, Completions = 237. Not matching the numbers given in the claim.\n5. **2012**: Attempts = 389, Completions = 223. Oh, this matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nNow, checking the \"college totals\" row: Attempts = 888, Completions = 507. These are higher than the claim's numbers, so not relevant here.\n\nSo the claim is specifically about a single year where attempts are 389 and completions are 223. In 2012, that's exactly what's shown. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant columns are 'attempts' and 'completions.' The matching row is 2012 for both.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be the row index 4 (since it's zero-based, so 2012 is row 4) with both 'attempts' and 'completions' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"from 2008 to 2012, the number of attempts be 888.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"the number of attempts\" refers to the 'attempts' column in the table. The time frame is from 2008 to 2012. \n\nLooking at the table, the years listed are 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and then college totals. For each year, there's a corresponding number of attempts.\n\nI should check if any row from 2008 to 2012 has 888 attempts in the 'attempts' column. Let me go through each relevant row:\n\n- 2008: Attempts = redshirt (not a numerical value)\n- 2009: 87 attempts\n- 2010: 8 attempts\n- 2011: 404 attempts\n- 2012: 389 attempts\n\nNone of these years have 888 attempts. The 'college totals' row is separate, showing total attempts as 888, but that's for all the years combined, not just from 2008 to 2012.\n\nSo, within the specific years listed in the claim (2008-2012), there are no rows where the number of attempts is 888. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that from 2008 to 2012, the number of attempts was 888. However, checking each year's 'attempts' column within this range shows no row with 888.

The claim says: \"Iowa record 389 attempt when they also record 2249 yard.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part of the claim means. The term \"record 389 attempt\" refers to the number of attempts in a particular year. Looking at the table, the 'attempts' column has values for each year. In 2012, the attempts are listed as 389, so that seems relevant.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"2249 yard.\" The 'yards' column in the table shows 2249 for the year 2012. So, both 389 attempts and 2249 yards happened in 2012.\n\nNow, I need to check if these two numbers are recorded in the same row of the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- 2008: All redshirt\n- 2009: 87 attempts, 470 yards (different years)\n- 2010: 8 attempts, 45 yards\n- 2011: 404 attempts, 3022 yards\n- 2012: 389 attempts, 2249 yards\n- College totals: Total across all years\n\nSo yes, in the 2012 row, both 389 attempts and 2249 yards are present. Therefore, the claim is supported by this specific row.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other relevant rows that might affect the claim. The college totals row includes total attempts (888) and total yards (5786), which aren't the same as individual year stats, so they don't apply here.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because both 389 attempts and 2249 yards are indeed recorded in the same year, 2012.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then check against the table.\n\nFirst, breaking down the claim: It mentions Iowa having 404 attempts in the year 2012. Looking at the table columns, I see 'year', 'team', 'attempts', etc. So I need to find the row for the year 2012 and the 'attempts' column to verify the number.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n- The first row is 2008 with redshirt attempts.\n- 2009: 87 attempts.\n- 2010: 8 attempts.\n- 2011: 404 attempts. Hmm, that's a big number, but it's for 2011.\n- 2012: 389 attempts.\n- The last row is the college totals.\n\nWait, the claim says \"in 2012,\" so I should look at the 2012 row. There, under 'attempts', it's listed as 389, not 404. That means the number of attempts in 2012 for Iowa was 389, not 404.\n\nBut wait, the 2011 row does have 404 attempts. So maybe the claim is mixing up the years? But the user specifically said 2012. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating a number from the previous year.\n\nI should make sure I'm checking all relevant cells. The claim refers to two things: the year (2012) and the attempts (404). So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Year column for 2012.\n- Attempts column for 2012, which is 389.\n\nBut since the number doesn't match, the claim is false. I don't need to look beyond that because the numbers don't align with the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Iowa have 404 attempt in 2012,\" we check the 'attempts' column for the year 2012.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions three things: completions, yards, and perhaps the team involved. The key numbers are 8 completions and 45 yards. So I'm looking for a row where the completion count is 8 and the yardage is 45, associated with the team \"iowa.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the following columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match these numbers. \n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- **2008**: All redshirt, so no relevant data.\n- **2009**: Completions are 42, which is way higher than 8, but let's note that in this row, completions and yards are non-redshirt values, so maybe Vanderberg isn't active here.\n- **2010**: Completions=5, yards=45. Wait, that's exactly the yardage mentioned (45). But completions are only 5, not 8. So this doesn't match both criteria.\n- **2011**: Completions=237, yards=3022. No match here.\n- **2012**: Completions=223, yards=2249. Again, no match.\n- **College totals**: Completions=507, yards=5786. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait a second, in the 2010 row, the yards are exactly 45, but completions are only 5. The claim says 8 completions and 45 yards. So while one number matches, the other doesn't.\n\nI need to check if there's another year where both completions=8 and yards=45. From the table, let me see:\n\nLooking through each row again quickly. None of them have both 8 completions and 45 yards. The closest is 2010 with 5 completions and 45 yards.\n\nAlso, checking for the team \"iowa\" in all rows, but I don't see any row where both completions=8 and yards=45. \n\nWait, could it be that Vanderberg wasn't part of iowa in 2009? The claim says \"make 8 completion on iowa,\" so perhaps he's a player who made 8 completions when his yards were 45 for iowa.\n\nBut in the table, I don't see any row where team is iowa and completions are 8. So this suggests that the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires both 8 completions and 45 yards for \"iowa.\" The table doesn't show such a combination, only 5 completions with 45 yards in 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"completions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. It has columns for year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. Each row represents a specific year from 2008 to 2012 and includes some statistics for the Iowa team in that year. There's also a total row at the end for college totals.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific numbers: 389 attempts and 237 completions. So I need to find a row where both of these numbers appear together. \n\nLooking through each row:\n- 2008: Attempts are redshirt, completions are redshirt. Not relevant.\n- 2009: 87 attempts, 42 completions. Not matching.\n- 2010: 8 attempts, 5 completions. No match.\n- 2011: 404 attempts, 237 completions. Wait, here we have 389 attempts and 237 completions? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. The 2011 row has 404 attempts and 237 completions. The claim says 389 attempts when completions are 237. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something. Let's see the next rows.\n\n- 2012: 389 attempts, 223 completions. So here we have 389 attempts but only 223 completions.\n- College totals: 888 attempts, 507 completions. Doesn't match either.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says \"when the completion be 237\". In the table, the row for 2011 has 237 completions with 404 attempts. But the claim mentions 389 attempts with 237 completions. Is there a row where both 389 attempts and 237 completions occur? Looking again:\n\nI don't see such a row in the table provided. The only rows with those numbers are:\n- Attempts: 389 is only in the 2012 row, but that has 223 completions.\n- Completions: 237 is in the 2011 row, which has 404 attempts.\n\nTherefore, there's no single row where both 389 attempts and 237 completions occur together. So the claim seems to be incorrect because those two numbers don't coexist in any of the rows listed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"389 attempt be record when the completion be 237.\" Maybe it's implying that 389 is a record when they have 237 completions? But looking at the table, the records for attempts and completions are per year or totals. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the numbers. Let me double-check:\n\nIn 2011: 404 attempts, 237 completions.\nIn 2012: 389 attempts, 223 completions.\n\nSo no row has both 389 and 237. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because such a row doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there's a year with 389 attempts and 237 completions.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"from 2008 to 2011 , the number of attempt be 888\" is true based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. Each row represents a specific year from 2008 to 2012, along with some totals at the bottom labeled as \"college totals\".\n\nThe claim mentions \"from 2008 to 2011\", so I need to focus on those years. That means I should look at rows where year is 2008, 2009, 2010, or 2011.\n\nNow, the claim refers to \"the number of attempt be 888\". The word \"attempt\" in the context of sports statistics usually refers to the total attempts a player made, like passes attempted or rushing attempts. In the table, the column under \"attempts\" seems to have numbers: for 2008 it's redshirt, which probably means the athlete wasn't playing much that year. The following years have numbers like 87, 8, 404, etc.\n\nLooking at the claim again, it says from 2008 to 2011, the number of attempts is 888. So I need to see if the total attempts across these four years add up to 888.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because each year has its own attempt count. Maybe the claim is referring to a specific category, like rushing attempts or passing attempts, but since the table doesn't specify, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the total attempts across those four years summing up to 888.\n\nLet me check the table:\n\n- 2008: redshirt (assuming this is 0 attempts)\n- 2009: 87\n- 2010: 8\n- 2011: 404\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 87 = 87, plus 8 is 95, plus 404 brings it to 499. That's way less than 888.\n\nBut wait, there's a \"college totals\" row which says attempts are 888. Maybe the claim is referring to that total. However, \"from 2008 to 2011\" implies those specific years, not including the college totals row.\n\nSo if I consider just the four years 2008-2011, their attempts add up to 499. The college totals for attempts are 888, but that's a separate row at the end, probably combining all years from 2008 onwards.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it's using the overall total attempts (which include more years) instead of just the four specified years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the sum of attempts from 2008 to 2011 is 499, not 888. The 888 figure likely includes additional years beyond 2011.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this sentence. It seems like there are two main parts: \n1. There was a 404 attempt for Vanderberg in Iowa.\n2. When the record yards were at 2249.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if any row has both \"Attempts\" as 404 and \"Yards\" as 2249. Alternatively, it might be that the record yard of 2249 happened during a year when Vanderberg had 404 attempts.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row represents a specific year for Iowa. So I should look through each row to see if any have both 404 attempts and 2249 yards. \n\nLet me check each row:\n\n- 2008: redshirt on all columns.\n- 2009: Attempts=87, Yards=470.\n- 2010: Attempts=8, Yards=45.\n- 2011: Attempts=404, Yards=3022.\n- 2012: Attempts=389, Yards=2249.\n\nSo in 2011, attempts are 404, but yards are 3022. In 2012, yards are 2249, but attempts are 389. \n\nWait, so the claim is about a specific year where Vanderberg had 404 attempts when the record yard was 2249. From the table, in 2011, 404 attempts happened with 3022 yards, and in 2012, 2249 yards came from 389 attempts.\n\nSo, during the same year, does any row have both? It seems no. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's about when the record yard reached 2249, was Vanderberg's attempt count at that point 404?\n\nBut in 2012, Vanderberg had 389 attempts when the yards hit 2249.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is mixing up years and looking for a specific combination across different rows. Maybe the person is implying that during a year when the record yard was set to 2249 (which happened in 2012), the attempts by Vanderberg were 404.\n\nBut according to the table, in 2012, Vanderberg had 389 attempts, not 404. So maybe there's confusion between 2011 and 2012.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that when the record yard was 2249 (which happened in 2012), Vanderberg attempted 404 passes, but according to the table, he only did 389 in 2012. Therefore, the data doesn't support both being true at the same time.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim's two parts don't match any row's data. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if there exists a year where Vanderberg had 404 attempts and the record yardage was 2249 simultaneously.\n\n1. **Check each relevant column for the condition:**\n   - **Attempts:** Look for rows with \"Attempts\" equal to 404.\n   - **Yards:** Look for rows where \"Yards\" are 2249.\n\n2. **Analyze the table:**\n   - In 2011, Vanderberg had 404 attempts but with 3022 yards.\n   - In 2012, Vanderberg had 389 attempts when the record was set at 2249 yards.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** There's no row where both conditions (404 attempts and 2249 yards) are met.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
