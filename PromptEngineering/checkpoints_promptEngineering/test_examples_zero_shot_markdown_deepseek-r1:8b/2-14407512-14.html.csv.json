    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Tom Hilde is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully reading both the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table: it's a markdown table with several columns: rank, name, nationality, 1st (m), points, and overall wc points (rank). The data for each row is as follows:\n\n- Rank 1: Janne Ahonen from Finland. His 1st(m) score is 199.5, points are 187.9, and his overall WC points rank is 810 with a ranking of 2.\n- Rank 2: Tom Hilde from Norway. His 1st(m) score is 193, points are 185.6, and his overall WC points rank is 682 with a ranking of 4.\n- Rank 3: Anders Jacobsen from Norway. His 1st(m) is 191, points 181.2, overall WC points rank is 283 with rank 13.\n- Rank 4: Dmitry Vassiliev from Russia. His 1st(m) is 191, points 178.2, overall WC points rank is 236 with rank 16.\n- Rank 5: Thomas Morgenstern from Austria. His 1st(m) is 188, points 177.6, and his overall WC points rank is 1115 with rank 1.\n\nNow, the claim says: \"Tom Hilde from Norway be rank 2nd overall with 682 overall wc point.\" I need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nFirst, verifying Tom Hilde's name and nationality. In the table, the second row is Tom Hilde, Norwegian. So that matches the claim's \"from Norway.\"\n\nNext, checking his overall wc points rank. The claim says he's 2nd overall. Looking at the table, under overall wc points (rank), for Tom Hilde it says 682 with a rank of 4. So wait, that means his overall rank is 4th, not 2nd. That's different from what the claim states.\n\nAlso, looking at the 'points' column for Tom Hilde: 185.6. The claim doesn't mention points, so maybe it's just about the ranking part.\n\nSo the main discrepancy is in the \"overall wc points (rank)\". According to the table, Tom Hilde is rank 4, not 2. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because his overall rank is 4th, not 2nd.\n\nI should also check that all other aspects match. His nationality and name are correct. But the crucial part is his overall ranking. Since it's incorrect there, the entire claim is false.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to find which cells in the table support or contradict the claim. The claim refers to Tom Hilde's overall wc points rank and possibly his position as 2nd in rank, but looking at the columns, 'rank' is his position (2), and 'overall wc points (rank)' is another column. So both 'rank' and 'overall wc points (rank)' are relevant.\n\nWait, the claim says \"rank 2nd overall with 682 overall wc point.\" Hmm, maybe it's a bit ambiguous. But since in the table, under 'overall wc points (rank)', Tom Hilde has 682 with rank 4, so that's where the issue is. Also, his actual rank is 2, but the overall WC points rank is 4.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, we need to check both: whether he's ranked 2nd and whether his overall wc points are 682 with a certain rank. Since his overall wc points rank is not 2, that part is wrong. So I think only one of the relevant cells is needed for this, which is the 'overall wc points (rank)' column.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe both the rank and the overall wc points rank are relevant because the claim mentions both \"rank 2nd\" and \"682 overall wc point.\" Wait, in the table, Tom Hilde's points are 185.6, but the claim doesn't specify that, so it's about his ranking. So 'overall wc points (rank)' is what matters here.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index:1, column_name:\"overall wc points (rank)\" because that's where Tom Hilde's overall WC rank is listed as 4, which contradicts the claim of being 2nd.\n- Also, perhaps checking his actual rank in the 'rank' column to see if he's indeed 2. But since the table shows him as rank 2, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"be rank 2nd overall.\" So maybe the 'overall wc points (rank)' refers to the same thing? Or is it a separate ranking? I think in this context, the 'overall wc points (rank)' might be another metric, like total points across different competitions or something. But regardless, according to the table, his overall wc points rank is 4th.\n\nSo, since Tom Hilde's overall wc points rank is 4th, not 2nd, that makes the claim false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"anders jacobsen , represent nor , have the same number of point as tom hilde , also represent nor.\"\n\nBreaking it down, there are two main parts:\n1. anders jacobsen and tom hilde both represent Norway (nor nationality).\n2. They have the same number of points.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The row for anders jacobsen is rank 3, nationality nor.\n- The row for tom hilde is rank 2, nationality nor.\n\nSo both do represent Norway. That part checks out.\n\nNext, checking their points:\n- anders jacobsen has 181.2 points.\n- tom hilde has 185.6 points.\n\nWait, those numbers don't look the same. 181.2 isn't equal to 185.6. So they don't have the same number of points.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I'm misreading the columns. Let me check again:\n- The table has columns: rank, name, nationality, 1st (m), points, and overall wc points (rank).\n\nSo \"points\" column for anders is 181.2, and for tom it's 185.6.\n\nTherefore, they don't have the same number of points, which means the second part of the claim isn't accurate.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should look at the overall wc points rank as well. For anders, it's (13) and for tom, it's (4). But those are ranks, not points. So no, they don't have the same overall points either.\n\nSo putting it together: both represent Norway, but their points aren't equal. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Anders Jacobsen and Tom Hilde both represent Norway and have the same number of points. However, while both do represent Norway, their points differ (181.2 vs. 185.6). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the overall wc point (rank) of tom hilde be more than the overall wc point (rank) for janne ahonen.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate where in the table these two individuals are. Let me look through each row.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Jannen Ahonen\n- Row 2: Tom Hilde\n\nSo, their overall WC points and ranks are in the \"overall wc points (rank)\" column. \n\nI need to extract the values for both of them from this column.\n\nFor Jannen Ahonen, the rank is listed as 810 (2). Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. It says 810 with parentheses around 2, which probably means rank number 2 overall? Or is it position 810? Hmm, but in context, lower numbers are better. So if it's 2, that would mean higher than someone with 4 or 13.\n\nFor Tom Hilde, the rank is listed as 682 (4). So again, parentheses around 4 meaning his overall rank is 4th.\n\nNow, comparing their points: Jannen has 810 (probably rank 2), and Tom has 682 (rank 4).\n\nThe claim says Tom's overall rank is more than Jannen's. Wait, but in the table, Tom is ranked 4th, and Jannen is ranked 2nd. So 4 is not more than 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. If it's 810 as points, then perhaps their overall rank is based on those points. But looking at the table again, the \"overall wc points (rank)\" seems to be a ranking. So Jannen Ahonen is ranked 2nd, and Tom Hilde is ranked 4th.\n\nSo Tom's overall rank is lower than Jannen's. Therefore, the claim that Tom's overall rank is higher than Jannen's is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tom Hilde's overall WC points (rank) are higher than Jannen Ahonen's. However, upon examining the table, Jannen Ahonen has a higher rank (2nd) compared to Tom Hilde's 4th place. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
