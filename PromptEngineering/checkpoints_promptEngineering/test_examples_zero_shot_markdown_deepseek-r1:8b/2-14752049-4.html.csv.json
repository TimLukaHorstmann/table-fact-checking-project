    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in the world tourism ranking united state rank 1 place higher than mexico.\" So, first, I should figure out what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a ranking of countries by international tourist arrivals from 2010 to 2012. The columns include rank, country name, arrivals in 2012, 2011, and the changes between those years.\n\nThe key parts of the claim are \"united state\" (I think this is the USA) being ranked higher than mexico. So I need to check their ranks in the table.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The USA is at rank 1.\n- Mexico is at rank 2.\n\nSo, rank 1 is higher than rank 2. Therefore, the claim seems correct on first glance.\n\nWait, but I should also consider the other columns to make sure there's no discrepancy. For example, are their arrival numbers consistent? But since the ranks are based solely on the order in the table, as long as the USA is above Mexico, the claim holds.\n\nTherefore, I don't think any additional cells beyond rank and country are necessary unless there's a tiebreaker or another factor that affects the ranking. The problem doesn't mention anything else affecting the ranking, so only the ranks matter here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the United States is ranked higher than Mexico in the world tourism ranking. From the table, the USA is indeed ranked 1st and Mexico is 2nd. This directly supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in the world tourism ranking brazil have 3 million more international tourist arrival (2011) than argentina.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns for rank, country, arrivals in 2012, 2011, and then two change columns: one from 2011 to 2012 and another from 2010 to 2011.\n\nThe countries mentioned in the claim are Brazil and Argentina. So I should focus on their respective rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Brazil (rank 4), in 2011, international tourist arrivals were 5.4 million.\n- For Argentina (rank 5), in 2011, they had 5.7 million arrivals.\n\nWait, but the claim says Brazil had 3 million more than Argentina in 2011. Let me check the numbers again to make sure I'm not mixing up anything.\n\nSo, if Brazil had 5.4 million and Argentina had 5.7 million in 2011, then actually Argentina has more arrivals than Brazil in that year. That means the claim is incorrect because it states Brazil had more, but according to the table, Argentina actually had more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Brazil: 2012 was 5.6 million, which is an increase of 4.5% from 2011's 5.4 million.\n- For Argentina: 2012 was 5.5 million, a decrease of 1.9% from their 2011 figure of 5.7 million.\n\nSo in 2011, Brazil had 5.4 million and Argentina had 5.7 million. The difference is 5.7 - 5.4 = 0.3 million. So the claim says Brazil has 3 million more, which doesn't match because it's actually less.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because in 2011, Brazil had fewer international tourist arrivals than Argentina, not more. Also, the relevant cells are the ones for Brazil and Argentina in their respective 2011 columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Brazil had more arrivals than Argentina in 2011, when actually Argentina had more.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Peru's tourism ranking is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in the world tourism ranking peru be 1 of 2 country with less than 3 million international tourist arrival (2011).\" So, I need to check if Peru meets this criterion in 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a country and various years. For 2011, the number of international tourist arrivals for Peru is given as 2.5 million, right? Wait, no, let me check again. The table has columns for each year: 2012, 2011, change from 2011 to 2012, and another column which I think might be the change from 2010 to 2011.\n\nSo, in row 9, Peru is ranked at position 10. The \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\" for Peru is listed as 2.5 million. So that's 2.5 million in 2011.\n\nThe claim says Peru is one of two countries with less than 3 million arrivals in 2011. Since 2.5 million is indeed less than 3 million, this part seems to hold true for Peru.\n\nNow, I need to see if there's only one other country that also has less than 3 million arrivals in 2011. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Rank 1: United States - 62.7 million (much higher)\n- Rank 2: Mexico - 23.4 million\n- Rank 3: Canada - 16.0 million\n- Rank 4: Brazil - 5.4 million (this is less than 3 million)\nWait, no, wait. Wait, Brazil's 2011 arrivals are 5.4 million, which is more than 2.5 million but still above 3? No, 5.4 is more than 3, so it doesn't qualify.\n\nLet me check each country:\n\nLooking at the \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\" column:\n\n1. United States: 62.7M\n2. Mexico:23.4M\n3. Canada:16.0M\n4. Brazil:5.4M\n5. Argentina:5.7M\n6. Dominican Republic:4.3M\n7. Chile:3.1M\n8. Puerto Rico:3.0M\n9. Peru:2.5M\n10. Uruguay:2.8M\n\nWait, hold on. The claim says \"less than 3 million.\" So any country with arrivals less than 3 million in 2011.\n\nFrom the list above:\n\n- Brazil:5.4M \u2013 that's more than 3M.\n- Argentina:5.7M \u2013 also more.\n- Dominican Republic:4.3M \u2013 still over 3M.\n- Chile:3.1M \u2013 wait, no, 3.1M is just under? Wait, the claim says \"less than 3 million,\" so 3.1M would actually be less than 3? No, because it's 3.1 which is more than 3. So only countries with arrivals below 3M.\n\nLooking at each country:\n\n- Peru:2.5M (yes)\n- Uruguay:2.8M (yes, as 2.8 < 3)\nWait, wait, no. 2.8M is less than 3? Yes, because 2.8 is less than 3. So both Peru and Uruguay have arrivals below 3 million in 2011.\n\nSo that means there are two countries: Peru and Uruguay with arrivals less than 3 million in 2011.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table:\n\n- Rank 10 is Uruguay: international tourist arrivals (2011) is 2.8M.\nYes, so both Peru (2.5) and Uruguay (2.8) are below 3M.\n\nSo the claim says \"Peru be 1 of 2 countries with less than 3 million.\" That's correct because there are two countries: Peru and Uruguay.\n\nWait, but looking at the table again:\n\nIn the row for Peru (rank 9), arrivals in 2011 are 2.5M.\n\nFor Uruguay (rank 10), arrivals in 2011 are 2.8M.\n\nSo yes, both are below 3 million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because Peru is one of two countries with less than 3 million arrivals in 2011.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis confirms that Peru's international tourist arrivals in 2011 were 2.5 million, which is indeed less than 3 million. Additionally, Uruguay also had 2.8 million arrivals in the same year, making them the two countries meeting this criterion.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n- {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in the world tourism ranking chile be not 1 of the country with more than 4 million international tourist arrival (2012)\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is stating. It's saying that Chile does NOT rank among the top countries with over 4 million arrivals in 2012. So, to verify this, I need to check Chile's position and its number of arrivals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a country's ranking. The first column is rank, then the country name, followed by data for 2012, 2011, etc. \n\nI'll search for Chile in the country column. Scanning through, I see that Chile is ranked 7th. So, their position is 7th out of all countries listed here.\n\nNext, I check the international tourist arrivals for Chile in 2012. The number given is 3.5 million. \n\nNow, the claim refers to \"more than 4 million\". Since 3.5 million is less than 4 million, Chile does not have over 4 million arrivals in 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Chile is NOT among the top countries with more than 4 million arrivals is TRUE because Chile's arrivals are 3.5 million.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we check Chile's position and arrival numbers.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"in the world tourism ranking, mexico ranks 1 place higher than the united state.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with columns: rank, country, international tourist arrivals for 2012, 2011, and then the changes from 2011 to 2012 and 2010 to 2011.\n\nLet me identify where Mexico and the United States are in this table. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- Rank 2: Mexico\n- Rank 1: United States\n\nSo, in terms of ranking, Mexico is at position 2 and the US is at position 1. The claim states that Mexico ranks higher than the US by one place. But according to the table, the opposite is true\u2014the US is ranked higher (1st) compared to Mexico (2nd). \n\nTo be thorough, I should check their actual rankings for each year. For 2012, the US is rank 1 and Mexico is rank 2. The same holds true for previous years: in 2011, the US was still rank 1 with 62.7 million arrivals, while Mexico remained at rank 2 with 23.4 million arrivals.\n\nSo the change from 2011 to 2012 shows a slight increase for both, but their rankings don't switch.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"in the world tourism ranking uruguay have the least international tourist arrival (2012).\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about the country Uruguay having the least arrivals in 2012. So I need to look at the year 2012 column for Uruguay and see how it compares to other countries.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: rank, country, international tourist arrivals for 2012, 2011, and then some changes. The claim is specifically about 2012 arrivals, so I should focus on that column.\n\nI'll go through each row to find Uruguay's data. Scanning down, I see the ranks: 1 is the US, 2 Mexico, 3 Canada, 4 Brazil, 5 Argentina, 6 Dominican Republic, 7 Chile, 8 Puerto Rico, 9 Peru, and 10 Uruguay.\n\nSo Uruguay is ranked 10th in this list. Now, to check if they have the least arrivals in 2012, I need to compare their 2012 numbers with others. Let's look at the \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" column:\n\n- United States: 67.0 million\n- Mexico: 23.4 million\n- Canada: 16.3 million\n- Brazil: 5.6 million\n- Argentina: 5.5 million\n- Dominican Republic: 4.5 million\n- Chile: 3.5 million\n- Puerto Rico: 3.0 million\n- Peru: 2.8 million\n- Uruguay: 2.6 million\n\nNow, arranging these numbers from smallest to largest:\n\n1. Argentina: 5.5 million\n2. Brazil: 5.6 million\n3. Peru: 2.8 million\n4. Chile: 3.5 million\n5. Puerto Rico: 3.0 million\n6. Dominican Republic: 4.5 million\n7. Canada: 16.3 million\n8. Mexico: 23.4 million\n9. Uruguay: 2.6 million\n10. United States: 67.0 million\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the numbers because I think I might have mixed some up. Let's list them again:\n\n- Uruguay: 2.6 million (2012)\n- Peru: 2.8 million\n- Chile: 3.5 million\n- Puerto Rico: 3.0 million\n- Dominican Republic: 4.5 million\n- Canada: 16.3 million\n- Mexico: 23.4 million\n- Argentina: 5.5 million\n- Brazil: 5.6 million\n- United States: 67.0 million\n\nSo ordering them from smallest to largest:\n\nThe smallest is Peru at 2.8, then Uruguay at 2.6? Wait, no, 2.6 is less than 2.8. So actually, Uruguay has the smallest number in this list because 2.6 is less than all others except maybe some I didn't include. But looking at the table, the next lowest after Peru is Chile (3.5), then Puerto Rico (3.0), Dominican Republic (4.5), Canada (16.3), Mexico (23.4), Argentina (5.5), Brazil (5.6), and US (67).\n\nWait, no, because 2.6 is less than 2.8, so Uruguay has the lowest in 2012 arrivals? But I thought other countries like Argentina and Brazil might have lower or higher numbers.\n\nWait, let me list all the 2012 numbers:\n\n- Uruguay: 2.6 million\n- Peru: 2.8 million\n- Chile: 3.5 million\n- Puerto Rico: 3.0 million\n- Dominican Republic: 4.5 million\n- Canada: 16.3 million\n- Mexico: 23.4 million\n- Argentina: 5.5 million\n- Brazil: 5.6 million\n- United States: 67.0 million\n\nSo the smallest is Uruguay with 2.6 million, followed by Peru at 2.8, then Chile (3.5), Puerto Rico (3.0). Wait, no\u20143.0 is more than 2.6 and 2.8? No, 3.0 is higher than both. So the order would be:\n\n1. Uruguay: 2.6\n2. Peru: 2.8\n3. Chile: 3.5\n4. Puerto Rico: 3.0 (Wait, 3.0 is more than 2.6 and 2.8? No, it's higher than both. So actually, the next after Uruguay would be Peru.\n\nSo the smallest is Uruguay with 2.6 million, then Peru at 2.8, followed by Chile at 3.5, then Puerto Rico at 3.0 (wait, no, 3.0 is more than 2.6 and 2.8). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me list them numerically:\n\n- Uruguay: 2.6 million\n- Peru: 2.8 million\n- Then Chile: 3.5, Puerto Rico: 3.0 (but 3.0 is more than 2.8? No, 3.0 is higher than both 2.6 and 2.8). Wait, no\u20143.0 is higher than 2.8 but lower than 3.5.\n\nWait, no, 3.0 is more than 2.8 because it's 3 million vs 2.8 million. So the order would be:\n\n1. Uruguay: 2.6\n2. Peru: 2.8\n3. Puerto Rico: 3.0\n4. Chile: 3.5\n5. Dominican Republic: 4.5\n6. Argentina: 5.5\n7. Brazil: 5.6\n8. Mexico: 23.4\n9. Canada: 16.3 (wait, no\u2014Canada is 16.3, which is more than Mexico's 23.4? No, wait, Mexico is 23.4, which is higher than Canada's 16.3. So actually, the order should be:\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me sort all the numbers correctly.\n\nList of 2012 arrivals in descending order (highest to lowest):\n\n- United States: 67.0\n- Mexico: 23.4\n- Canada: 16.3\n- Brazil: 5.6\n- Argentina: 5.5\n- Peru: 2.8\n- Uruguay: 2.6\n- Chile: 3.5\n- Puerto Rico: 3.0\n- Dominican Republic: 4.5\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3.5 is higher than 4.5? No, wait, 3.5 is less than 4.5. So the correct order from highest to lowest:\n\n1. United States: 67.0\n2. Mexico: 23.4\n3. Canada: 16.3\n4. Brazil: 5.6\n5. Argentina: 5.5\n6. Chile: 3.5\n7. Puerto Rico: 3.0\n8. Dominican Republic: 4.5 (Wait, but 4.5 is higher than some others)\n9. Peru: 2.8\n10. Uruguay: 2.6\n\nNo, that's not correct because Chile is 3.5, which is less than Mexico and Canada but higher than Puerto Rico. Wait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nI think the key point is whether Uruguay has the lowest number in 2012 arrivals. Looking at the list:\n\n- United States: 67\n- Mexico:23\n- Canada:16\n- Brazil:5\n- Argentina:5\n- Chile:3\n- Puerto Rico:3\n- Peru:2\n- Uruguay:2\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- United States:67.0\n- Mexico:23.4\n- Canada:16.3\n- Brazil:5.6\n- Argentina:5.5\n- Chile:3.5\n- Puerto Rico:3.0\n- Dominican Republic:4.5\n- Peru:2.8\n- Uruguay:2.6\n\nSo, the smallest is Uruguay at 2.6, followed by Peru at 2.8. Then, higher than that comes Chile (3.5), then Puerto Rico (3.0), but wait, 3.0 is less than 3.5, so it should be after.\n\nWait, no\u2014Chile is 3.5 and Puerto Rico is 3.0. So 3.0 is higher than Peru's 2.8 but lower than Chile's 3.5. So the order from smallest to largest would be:\n\n1. Uruguay:2.6\n2. Peru:2.8\n3. Puerto Rico:3.0\n4. Chile:3.5\n5. Dominican Republic:4.5\n6. Argentina:5.5\n7. Brazil:5.6\n8. Canada:16.3\n9. Mexico:23.4\n10. United States:67.0\n\nSo yes, Uruguay has the smallest number in 2012 arrivals at 2.6 million. Therefore, Uruguay would have the lowest number of arrivals compared to all other countries listed.\n\nTherefore, if we are ranking all the countries listed (which includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, United States), then Uruguay has the smallest number of arrivals in 2012.\n\nSo the statement \"Uruguay had the fewest tourists in 2012\" is correct based on this data because 2.6 million is less than all other numbers listed.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if there are other countries not included in the table that might have fewer tourists than Uruguay. For example, maybe some smaller nations not mentioned here could have had even fewer arrivals. But based solely on the data provided (which includes 10 countries), Uruguay indeed has the lowest number of tourist arrivals.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that Uruguay did have the fewest tourists in 2012 among the listed countries.\n</think>\n\nUruguay had the fewest tourists in 2012 compared to the other countries listed. Based on the data, Uruguay received 2.6 million visitors, which is less than all other nations mentioned.\n\n**Answer:**  \nUruguay had the fewest tourists in 2012 with 2.6 million arrivals.",

The claim says: \"in the world tourism ranking chile and the dominican republic each have over 4 million international tourist arrivals in 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's about Chile and the Dominican Republic having more than 4 million visitors each in 2012. So I need to check their respective numbers for that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country with its rank, country name, international tourist arrivals (2012), (2011), and the changes between those years. The columns relevant here are \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" because that's what the claim is referring to.\n\nI'll go through each country mentioned in the claim. Starting with Chile, which is ranked 7th. In the 2012 column for Chile, it shows 3.5 million. Wait, that's only 3.5 million, right? That's less than 4 million. So according to this, Chile doesn't have over 4 million in 2012. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. No, the number is definitely 3.5 million.\n\nNext, the Dominican Republic is ranked 6th. Looking at its 2012 arrivals, it's listed as 4.5 million. That's over 4 million. So the Dominican Republic does meet the criteria.\n\nSo for Chile, the arrival in 2012 was 3.5 million, which is under 4 million, while the Dominican Republic had 4.5 million, which is above. Therefore, the claim says both have over 4 million, but Chile doesn't meet that. So the claim isn't fully true.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if \"over 4 million\" includes 4.0 and above or strictly more than 4.0. Since Chile has exactly 3.5, which is under, it's definitely not over. The Dominican Republic at 4.5 is over. So the claim states both have it, but only one does.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because not both countries meet the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in 2012, Chile had 3.5 million arrivals, which is below 4 million, while the Dominican Republic had 4.5 million. Therefore, only the Dominican Republic meets the criterion, making the claim incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about Peru's international tourist arrivals in 2011 is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"in the world tourism ranking peru be the only country with less than 3 million international tourist arrival in 2011.\" So, the claim is stating that Peru was the sole country with fewer than 3 million arrivals in 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find Peru's data for 2011. The relevant column for 2011 is \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\". Scanning down the list, I see Peru is ranked number 9. In the 2011 column, Peru had 2.5 million arrivals.\n\nNow, let me check other countries in the table to see if any others had less than 3 million in 2011. Starting from rank 1:\n\n- United States: 62.7 million (much higher)\n- Mexico: 23.4 million\n- Canada: 16.0 million\n- Brazil: 5.4 million (this is less than 3 million?)\nWait, no, 5.4 million is actually more than 2.5 million. So that's above.\n\nContinuing down:\n- Argentina: 5.7 million (also above)\n- Dominican Republic: 4.3 million\n- Chile: 3.1 million (just below 3 million)\n- Puerto Rico: 3.0 million (exactly 3 million, so not less)\n- Peru: 2.5 million (less than 3)\n- Uruguay: 2.8 million (also above)\n\nWait, Chile had 3.1 million in 2011, which is just under 3 million? No, wait, 3.1 is actually more than 3.0 but less than 4.0. Wait, no\u2014Chile's 2011 arrivals were 3.1 million, so that's still below 3 million? No, 3.1 million is above 3 million. Oh, I see, I might have misread that.\n\nWait, let me check the table again:\n\nPeru in 2011: 2.5 million\nChile in 2011: 3.1 million\n\nSo Chile's arrivals were higher than Peru's but still below 4 million. But wait, the claim is about being \"less than 3 million.\" So Chile had 3.1 million, which is above 3 million (since it's 3.1). Therefore, only Peru in 2011 had less than 3 million.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe column for each country shows their arrivals in 2012 and 2011, and the changes. For 2011, Peru is 2.5 million. Now, looking at other countries:\n\n- Argentina: 5.7 million (2011)\n- Brazil: 5.4 million\n- Canada: 16 million\n- Chile: 3.1 million (so more than 3, as it's 3.1)\n- Mexico: 23.4\n- United States: 62.7\n\nSo, in 2011, Peru had the lowest at 2.5 million. Then Chile was next with 3.1, which is above 3. So, only Peru was below 3 million. Therefore, the claim says Peru was the only country with less than 3 million in 2011. That seems true based on the table.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table:\n\n- Rank 8: Puerto Rico had 3.0 million in 2011, which is equal to 3 million, not less.\n- Rank 9: Peru had 2.5 million\n- Rank 10: Uruguay had 2.8 million in 2011.\n\nWait, no, Uruguay's 2011 arrivals were actually 2.8 million, but the change from 2010 to 2011 was +21.6%. So, in 2011, Peru is at 2.5, Chile at 3.1, so only Peru is below 3.\n\nWait, no\u2014Chile's 2011 arrivals were 3.1 million, which is above 3. Therefore, the only country with less than 3 million was Peru in 2011. So the claim would be true.\n\nBut wait, let me check all other countries:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRank 1: US - 62.7 (much higher)\nRank 2: Mexico -23.4\nRank3: Canada-16\nRank4:Brazil-5.4\nRank5:Argentina-5.7\nRank6:DR-4.3\nRank7:Chile-3.1\nRank8:PR-3.0\nRank9:Peru-2.5\nRank10:Uruguay-2.8\n\nSo, only Peru had less than 3 million in 2011. So the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that in 2011, Peru was indeed the sole country with international tourist arrivals below 3 million.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in the world tourism ranking uruguay have more international tourist arrival than peru in 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and identify which cells are relevant. The table has columns: rank, country, international tourist arrivals for 2012, 2011, and then the changes from 2011 to 2012 and 2010 to 2011.\n\nSince the claim is about 2012 arrivals, I should focus on the \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" column. The countries in question are Uruguay and Peru. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- Uruguay is ranked 10th with 2.6 million international tourists in 2012.\n- Peru is ranked 9th with 3.5 million international tourists in 2012.\n\nSo, comparing these two, Peru had more arrivals than Uruguay in 2012. That would mean that the claim stating Uruguay had more is false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Sometimes tables can be tricky with formatting. The numbers for Peru in 2012 are indeed higher than Uruguay's. So yes, Peru has more arrivals than Uruguay in 2012.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look at the \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" column for both Uruguay and Peru.\n\n- **Uruguay (row 10)**: 2.6 million\n- **Peru (row 9)**: 3.5 million\n\nSince Peru's 2012 arrivals are higher than Uruguay's, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
