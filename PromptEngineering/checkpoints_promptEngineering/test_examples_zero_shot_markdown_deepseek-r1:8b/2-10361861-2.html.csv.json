    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"week 2 have more attendance than week 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing two weeks: week 2 and week 1 in terms of attendance numbers. Specifically, it's saying that week 2 had more attendees than week 1.\n\nLooking at the table provided, which lists various weeks with corresponding dates, opponents, results, and attendance numbers. I can see that each row represents a different week, starting from week 1 up to week 16.\n\nSo, for the claim to be TRUE, two things must be true:\n1. Week 2 is indeed a valid week in the table.\n2. The attendance number for week 2 is higher than that of week 1.\n\nLet me verify each part. \n\nStarting with week 1: according to the table, it's on September 7, 1980 against the Atlanta Falcons, and the attendance is 44773. Then, week 2 is September 14, 1980 against the Philadelphia Eagles with an attendance of 46460.\n\nWait a second, that seems correct. So, comparing these two numbers: 46460 (week 2) vs. 44773 (week 1). \n\nTo determine if week 2 had more attendance than week 1, I need to check if 46460 is greater than 44773. Subtracting the two, 46460 - 44773 equals 1687. Since 1687 is a positive number, that means week 2 indeed had more attendees.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should look at the columns in the table. The relevant column here is \"attendance,\" which directly measures the number of people attending each game. So, any comparison regarding attendance should focus on this column.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement is TRUE because week 2's attendance (46460) is higher than week 1's (44773). \n\nNow, I need to make sure that I'm pointing to the correct cells in the table for my analysis. Week 1 is row index 0 (since it starts at 1), and week 2 is row index 1. The column we're concerned with is \"attendance.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 0, column \"attendance\"\n- Row index 1, column \"attendance\"\n\nThis will help in clearly showing which data points are being compared for the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be a total of 16 week in the list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nThe table lists 14 weeks, from week 1 to week 14, each with corresponding dates and other details like opponents and attendance. The claim says there are 16 weeks in total, so I need to check if the table actually includes 16 weeks or not.\n\nLooking at the table, it starts at week 1 and goes up to week 16, but when I count them, it stops at week 14 as the highest number. So that means the last row is for December 14, 1980, which is week 15, wait no, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, the table has weeks numbered from 1 to 16, but looking closely:\n\n- Week 1: September 7, 1980\n- Week 2: September 14, 1980\n...\nContinuing up to week 16 on December 21, 1980.\n\nBut wait, let me list them out properly. The first row is week 1, the next week 2, and so on until week 16. So that's 16 weeks in total.\n\nHmm, but when I look at the data, it goes up to week 14, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all the weeks:\n\n1: Sep 7\n2: Sep 14\n3: Sep 21\n4: Sep 28\n5: Oct 5\n6: Oct 12\n7: Oct 19\n8: Oct 26\n9: Nov 2\n10: Nov 9\n11: Nov 16\n12: Nov 23\n13: Nov 30\n14: Dec 7\n15: Dec 14\n16: Dec 21\n\nWait, that's 16 weeks. So the table does have 16 entries, from week 1 to week 16.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the initial markdown table, I think I might have miscounted the number of rows. Let me count each row:\n\nEach week is listed as a separate row, starting from week 1 up to week 16. So there are indeed 16 weeks in total.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are 16 weeks in the list is TRUE. The relevant cells would be all the row indices since each week contributes to the total count.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains 14 entries as per the initial markdown, but upon reviewing, it actually lists from week 1 through week 16, totaling 16 weeks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states that the highest number of crowd attendance was on week 4.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'attendance' column in the table to identify the numbers for each week. \n\nI'll list out the attendances per week:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n- Week 11: 46032\n- Week 12: 47234\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nNow, I'll compare these numbers to find the highest attendance. Starting from week 1 upwards, the attendances increase until week 4, which is 80291. Then, there's a slight dip in week 5 and onwards but then fluctuates again.\n\nLooking at all attendances:\n\nWeek 4 has 80291, which seems higher than the surrounding weeks. For instance, Week 3 is 59983 and Week 5 is 47583. The next highest after Week 4 is Week 8 with 56191, which is still lower than 80291.\n\nChecking further down, Week 14 has 65649, which is less than 80291. No other weeks have higher attendances than Week 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim that week 4 has the highest attendance is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, I checked each week's attendance against each other and found that week 4 had the highest number of attendees.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"week 13 have the least number of crowd attend\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that week 13 had the smallest attendance compared to all other weeks listed in the table. So, my task is to check the attendance numbers for each week and see if week 13 indeed has the least number.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'week' column goes from 1 to 16. Week 13's date is November 30, 1980, and the opponent is the New Orleans Saints. The result was a win with a score of 23-20, and the attendance listed is 30936.\n\nNow, I need to compare this attendance number to all other weeks' attendances. Let me list out the attendances for each week:\n\nWeek 1: 44773  \nWeek 2: 46460  \nWeek 3: 59983  \nWeek 4: 80291  \nWeek 5: 47583  \nWeek 6: 46751  \nWeek 7: 44487  \nWeek 8: 56191  \nWeek 9: 52060  \nWeek 10: 46264  \nWeek 11: 46032  \nWeek 12: 47234  \nWeek 13: 30936  \nWeek 14: 65649  \nWeek 15: 42202  \nWeek 16: 51064  \n\nNow, I need to find which week has the lowest attendance. Let's go through them:\n\n- Week 1 is 44k, higher than most.\n- Week 2 is about 46k, still higher.\n- Week 3 over 59k, definitely higher.\n- Week 4: almost 80k, way up there.\n- Week 5: around 47k, lower than week 1 and 2 but higher than later ones.\n- Week 6: similar to Week 5.\n- Week 7: about 44k, which is the same as some others.\n- Week 8: over 56k, still high.\n- Week 9: around 52k.\n- Week 10: 46k.\n- Week 11: 46k again.\n- Week 12: 47k, so a bit higher than 11.\n- Week 13: 30k, which is significantly lower than the others so far.\n- Week 14: over 65k, which jumps up.\n- Week 15: 42k.\n- Week 16: about 51k.\n\nLooking at these numbers, week 13 has 30,936 attendees. Comparing it to the others, all weeks have higher attendance except for perhaps a few. Let's see:\n\nWait, but in the list, weeks 11 and 15 are around 46k, which is still higher than 30k. So week 13 is indeed lower than all other weeks.\n\nSo, according to this data, week 13 has the least number of crowd attendances. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe attendance for week 13 is the lowest among all weeks listed in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim says: \"week 9 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of this claim means. It's comparing the attendance numbers for Week 9 and Week 10, specifically stating that Week 9 had 5796 more attendees than Week 10.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists various weeks from week 1 to week 16. Each row has details like the date, opponent, result, and attendance numbers. So for Weeks 9 and 10, I need to extract the attendance figures from those rows.\n\nStarting with Week 9: according to the table, it's in row number 9 (since the weeks are listed as 1 through 16). The \"attendance\" column for Week 9 shows 52060. \n\nThen, Week 10 is row number 10, and its attendance is 46264.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference between these two attendances. So, subtracting Week 10's attendance from Week 9's: 52060 - 46264. Let me do that subtraction step by step:\n\n52060 minus 46264:\n- Start with 52060 and subtract 40000, which gives me 12060.\n- Then subtract 6000 more, so 12060 - 6000 = 6060.\n- Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try again.\n\nActually, it's better to line them up:\n52060\n-46264\n--------\nCalculate each digit:\n\n6 (units place) of 52060 minus 4 of 46264: 6-4=2.\n0 (tens place): 0-6 can't do that, so borrow from the hundreds place. The 0 becomes 10, but since it's borrowing, I need to go higher up. Actually, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, I know that 52060 - 46264 = 5796 because 52060 minus 40000 is 12060; then subtract 6000 more gives 6060; wait, no, that can't be right because 52060 - 46264 should indeed be 5796.\n\nWait, let me check with another method: 46264 + 5796 = 52060? Let's add them. 46264 + 5000 is 51264, plus 796: 51264 + 700 = 51964; then +96 is 52060. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo the difference between Week 9 and Week 10 attendances is indeed 5796. But the claim says \"week 9 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10.\" So numerically, this seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should verify if I'm interpreting the claim correctly. The claim states that Week 9 has more attendees than Week 10 by 5796. From the numbers, 52060 - 46264 = 5796, which means Week 9 indeed has more attendees than Week 10 by that amount.\n\nSo based on this calculation, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe attendance for Week 9 is 52,060 and for Week 10 it's 46,264. The difference is 5,796, confirming that Week 9 had more attendees.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which weeks are being referred to in the claim. The claim mentions week 2 and week 1. Looking at the table headers, each row represents a week from 1 to 16. So, week 1 is when they played the Atlanta Falcons on September 7, 1980, and week 2 was against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 14, 1980.\n\nNext, I need to check the attendance numbers for both weeks. The table has an \"attendance\" column which lists the number of people who attended each game. For week 1, the attendance is 44773, and for week 2, it's 46460. \n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 44773 (week 1) vs. 46460 (week 2). To see if week 2 has less attendance than week 1, I can compare them directly. Since 46460 is greater than 44773, week 2 had more attendees than week 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"week 2 have less attendance than week 1\" is false because the actual attendance in week 2 was higher than in week 1.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare the attendance of week 2 and week 1.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be a total of 14 week in the list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is asking.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week, starting from week 1 up to week 16. So, the weeks go from 1 through 16, with each week having its own details.\n\nThe claim is stating that there are 14 weeks in total. To verify this, I need to check how many rows or entries are present in the table and see if it matches 14 weeks.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific week. The first row is week 1, and the last row is week 16. So, there are 16 different weeks listed here. Therefore, the total number of weeks in the list is 16, not 14.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me count again to be sure. The first entry is week 1, then 2, all the way up to 16. So that's definitely 16 weeks. Therefore, the claim stating there are 14 weeks in total would be incorrect because it's only 14 if we're excluding two weeks, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, since the table lists 16 weeks, the claim is false. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this check. The key column that determines the number of weeks is the \"week\" column. Each row has a unique week number from 1 to 16.\n\nTherefore, all rows in the table are relevant because each represents one week, and together they sum up to 16 weeks. But since the claim refers specifically to 14 weeks, maybe only the first 14 rows would be considered? Or perhaps not\u2014since the total is 16, any subset doesn't add up to 14 unless specified.\n\nWait, no, the claim isn't about a subset but the total number of weeks in the list. So all 16 weeks are relevant because that's the entire list. Therefore, checking each row's week number would confirm there are 16 weeks, not 14.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake and thought only up to week 14 was present? Let me check the table again. The last week listed is week 16 on December 21, 1980. So yes, it's definitely 16 weeks in total.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be all rows where \"week\" is from 1 to 16 because each contributes to the total count of 16 weeks, which contradicts the claim of 14 weeks.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists 16 weeks, not 14.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"week 13 have the most crowd attend\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should identify which week is being referred to. The claim says \"week 13,\" so I'll look for that in the table. Scanning through the 'week' column, I see that week 13's date is November 30, 1980, and it was against the New Orleans Saints with a result of a win (23 - 20). That seems correct.\n\nNext, the claim is about the attendance at week 13 being the highest. So, I need to look at the 'attendance' column for each week and find out which week had the most attendees. To do this accurately, I should list out all the attendances alongside their respective weeks.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n- Week 11: 46032\n- Week 12: 47234\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nNow, I'll compare these numbers to see which is the highest. Looking at the 'attendance' column:\n\nWeek 4 has 80291, which seems like the highest number in this list.\n\nWait, but the claim is about week 13. So, even though week 4 had a higher attendance than week 13, I need to check if week 13 indeed has more attendees than all other weeks before and after it.\n\nLet me list them again with their attendances for better clarity:\n\n1: 44773\n2: 46460\n3: 59983\n4: 80291 (highest so far)\n5: 47583\n6: 46751\n7: 44487\n8: 56191\n9: 52060\n10: 46264\n11: 46032\n12: 47234\n13: 30936\n14: 65649\n15: 42202\n16: 51064\n\nSo, week 4 indeed has the highest attendance at 80291. Week 13 only has 30936 attendees, which is much lower than week 4's number.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"week 13 have the most crowd attend\" is FALSE because week 4 had a higher attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because while week 13 did not have the highest attendance, it was less than week 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the highest number of crowd attendance in week 7.\" Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and focus on the 'week' column and the 'attendance' column. The goal is to find out which week had the highest attendance because that will help verify whether week 7 indeed has the highest number of attendees.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week, from week 1 to week 16. For each week, there's a corresponding date and the opponent team they played against, along with the result of the game and the attendance numbers.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the attendances for each week:\n\nWeek 1: 44773\nWeek 2: 46460\nWeek 3: 59983\nWeek 4: 80291\nWeek 5: 47583\nWeek 6: 46751\nWeek 7: 44487\nWeek 8: 56191\nWeek 9: 52060\nWeek 10: 46264\nWeek 11: 46032\nWeek 12: 47234\nWeek 13: 30936\nWeek 14: 65649\nWeek 15: 42202\nWeek 16: 51064\n\nNow, I need to find which week has the highest attendance. Let's go through each week and compare:\n\n- Week 1: 44773 vs others: lower than some.\n- Week 2: 46460: higher than Week 1 but lower than others.\n- Week 3: 59983: that's pretty high.\n- Week 4: 80291: that's even higher.\n- Week 5: 47583: lower than Week 4 and Week 3.\n- Week 6: 46751: similar to Week 2.\n- Week 7: 44487: this is actually lower than several weeks after it, like Week 8, 9, etc.\nWait a minute, so the attendances go up and down. Let's see where the highest number is.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nWeek 4 has the highest attendance with 80291. Then Week 8: 56191, Week 3:59983, but Week 4 is higher than both. So week 4 has the highest attendance, followed by week 8 and week 3.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check:\n\nWeek 4: 80291\n\nThen, looking at other weeks:\n\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649 (lower than 80291)\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nSo yes, week 4 has the highest attendance. So the claim that week 7 is the highest isn't correct because week 4 has a higher number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check which week had the highest attendance. By examining all weeks in the table, it's clear that Week 4 had the highest attendance at 80291. Therefore, the claim that Week 7 has the highest attendance is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"week 8 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's comparing the attendance figures for Week 8 and Week 10, specifically stating that Week 8 had 5796 more attendees than Week 10. Wait, actually, I think I might have misread that. The claim says \"week 8 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10,\" so it's saying that the attendance in Week 8 is higher by 5796 compared to Week 10.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week, with columns for date, opponent, result, and attendance. So, I need to find the attendance numbers for Week 8 and Week 10.\n\nLet me scan through the weeks:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n\nOkay, so Week 8's attendance is 56,191 and Week 10 is 46,264. Now, the claim says that Week 8 has 5,796 more attendees than Week 10.\n\nTo verify this, I need to calculate the difference between these two numbers. Let me subtract Week 10 from Week 8: 56191 minus 46264. \n\nCalculating that: 56,191 - 46,264 = 9,927. Wait, that's not 5,796. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nBut let me double-check my subtraction to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 56,191 minus 46,264:\n\n- Start from the right: 1 (units) - 4 can't do, so borrow 1 from tens place.\n- Tens place becomes 8 (since we borrowed 1 for units), and subtract 6: 8 - 6 = 2.\n- Hundreds place: 9 (since we borrowed earlier) minus 3 is 6.\n- Thousands place: 1 (after borrowing) minus 4, which can't do. So borrow 1 from the ten-thousands place.\n- Ten-thousands place becomes 5, and thousands place becomes 10 + 1 = 11.\n- Now subtract: 11 - 4 = 7, but wait, no, we had borrowed earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should just calculate it step by step:\n\n46,264 + 5,796 = ?\n\nLet me add 5,796 to 46,264:\n\n46,264 + 5,000 = 51,264\n51,264 + 700 = 51,964\n51,964 + 96 = 52,060\n\nSo 46,264 + 5,796 = 52,060. But in the table, Week 8's attendance is 56,191, which is higher than 52,060.\n\nWait, that means my initial difference calculation was wrong. Let me do it again:\n\n56,191 (Week 8) minus 46,264 (Week 10):\n\n- Subtracting 46,264 from 56,191.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n56,191\n-46,264\n=?\n\nStarting from the right:\n1 - 4: Can't do, borrow.\n91 becomes 91 (but wait, in subtraction, borrowing works differently). Let me write it out properly:\n\n```\n   56191\n- 46264\n--------\n```\n\nStarting from the units place:\n1 - 4: Can't do. Borrow 1 from the tens place.\nThe tens digit is 9, so borrow 1, making it 8, and add 10 to the units: 11 - 4 = 7.\n\nTens place: 8 (after borrowing) minus 6. Since we borrowed earlier, it's actually 8 - 6 = 2? Wait no, because in subtraction, when you borrow, the next digit is reduced by 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should do this step by step:\n\nSubtracting units:\n1 < 4, so borrow from tens.\nTens place is 9, becomes 8. Units become 11.\n11 - 4 = 7.\n\nTens place: 8 (after borrowing) minus 6.\nBut wait, in the top number, after borrowing, the tens digit is 8. So 8 - 6 = 2.\n\nHundreds place: 1 (from original 56191) minus 3.\nWait, the bottom number's hundreds digit is 6? No, the bottom number is 46,264. Let me write them properly:\n\n```\n   56,191\n- 46,264\n--------\n```\n\nLet's align them correctly:\n\n5 6,1 9 1\n4 6,2 6 4\n\nSo, aligning:\n\n- Ten-thousands: 5 vs 4. Since it's above, no issue.\n- Thousands: 6 vs 6. Equal, so difference here is 0.\n- Hundreds: 1 vs 2. Wait, the top number is 56,191, which is 5 ten-thousands, 6 thousands, 1 hundred, 9 tens, 1 unit.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to subtract digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units):\n\nTop: 1\nBottom:4\nSo 1 - 4 can't do. Borrow 1 from tens place.\n\nTens place in top is 9, so borrow 1 making it 8, and units become 11.\nNow, 11 - 4 =7.\n\nTens place (now 8) minus 6: 8-6=2.\n\nHundreds place in top is 1. Subtract the bottom's hundreds digit which is 2? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, the numbers are:\n\nTop: 56,191\nBottom:46,264\n\nLet me write them with placeholders for each digit:\n\n5 (ten-thousands) 6 (thousands) 1 (hundreds) 9 (tens) 1 (units)\n4 (ten-thousands) 6 (thousands) 2 (hundreds) 6 (tens) 4 (units)\n\nSo, subtracting each column:\n\nUnits: 1-4 \u2192 borrow needed.\nTens:9 becomes8 after borrowing. Units become11, 11-4=7.\n\nTens place: top is now8 - bottom 6. So 8-6=2.\n\nHundreds place: top is1 (before any borrowing) but we've borrowed for the units, so it's actually 0. So 0 - 2 \u2192 borrow needed.\n\nThousands place: top is6 (since no prior borrowing), but since hundreds place needed to borrow from thousands.\n\nSo thousands digit becomes5, and hundreds becomes10 + 1=11? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the difference as:\n\n56,191 -46,264 = ?\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nStart with 56,191 -40,000 =16,191\n\nThen subtract 6,264: 16,191 -6,264=?\n\nCompute 16,191 -6,000=10,191\n\nThen subtract 264: 10,191-200=9,991; 9,991-64=9,927.\n\nYes, so the difference is9,927.\n\nBut the claim says it's5,796 more. That doesn't match.\n\nSo, the initial claim that Week8 has5,796 more than Week10 is incorrect. Instead, it's actually9,927 more.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 9,927.\n\nSo the original statement seems to be wrong.\n</think>\n\nThe number of attendees for Week 8 (56,191) is greater than Week 10 (46,264) by 9,927, not 5,796. Therefore, the initial claim is incorrect.\n\nFinal Answer: The claim is false. Week 8 had 9,927 more attendees than Week 10.",
