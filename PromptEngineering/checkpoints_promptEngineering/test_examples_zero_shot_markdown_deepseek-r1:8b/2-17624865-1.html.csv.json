    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"muhsin corbbrey have win 2 fight by tko between 2005 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the fighter named Muhsin Corbbrey in the table. Let me scan through each row's 'opponent' column. Wait, the opponent column lists other fighters, so maybe I should check if Muhsin Corbbrey is listed as an opponent or as the main fighter.\n\nLooking at the first row: opponent is troy nelson, not Muhsin. Second row: ryan rayonec. Third: tim coleman. Fourth: shelton barnes. Fifth: kareem robinson. Sixth: anthony abrams. Seventh: ben lock. Eighth: emanuel gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez. Ninth: ricardo planter.\n\nHmm, I don't see Muhsin Corbbrey listed as an opponent in any of these rows. That might mean that he's not present in the table at all, which would imply that there's no record of him having two TKO wins between 2005 and 2009. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Muhsin is the fighter who won those fights, so I should look for a row where 'result' is 'win', 'method' is 'tko', and the date is between 2005 and 2009. Let me check each row:\n\n1. 2009-02-28: result win, method decision, not TKO.\n2. 2006-09-15: win, TKO. That's within 2005-2009.\n3. 2006-06-15: loss, so no.\n4. 2006-04-21: win, TKO. Also within date range.\n5. 2006-03-09: win, decision (unanimous). Not TKO.\n6. 2006-01-26: win, unanimous decision. No.\n7. 2005-11-26: win, unanimous decision. No.\n8. 2005-04-26: loss.\n9. 2005-04-08: draw.\n\nSo in row 2 and row 4, there are two wins by TKO that fit within the date range of 2005 to 2009. But wait, the claim is about Muhsin Corbbrey having these wins. The table doesn't mention him; instead, other fighters like Ryan Rayonec and Shelton Barnes have these wins.\n\nSince Muhsin Corbbrey isn't listed in any of the 'opponent' or 'result' columns as someone who has two TKO wins during that period, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check for Muhsin Corbbrey's record. He isn't listed in the table, so no relevant data exists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey fight 2 fight in florida in 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by analyzing each part of the claim and see if it aligns with the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the name: The claim refers to \"muhsin corbbrey.\" I should look for this exact name in the opponent column of the table because that's where fighters are listed. Scanning through the opponents:\n\n1. Troy Nelson\n2. Ryan Rayonec\n3. Tim Coleman\n4. Shelton Barnes\n5. Kareem Robinson\n6. Anthony Abrams\n7. Ben Lock\n8. Emanuel Gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez\n9. Ricardo Planter\n\nI don't see \"muhsin corbbrey\" in any of these names, so that might be a red flag. It's possible the name could be spelled differently or maybe it's an alias, but based on what's here, it doesn't seem to match.\n\nNext, the claim says there was a fight in Florida in 2005. Looking at the table, I'll check the venue column for any entries in Miami, Florida since that's often associated with Florida events. The venues listed are:\n\n1. Shorine Ball Room (Hilton Head)\n2. Omar Shrine Temple (Mount Pleasant)\n3. Michael's Eighth Avenue (Glen Burnie)\n4. Show Place Arena (Upper Marlboro)\n5. Radisson Hotel (Miami)\n\nIn 2005, the only Miami venue is the Radisson Hotel on April 26th against Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez. So, there was indeed a fight in Florida that year.\n\nNow, checking when muhsin corbbrey fought: Since I don't see his name as an opponent, maybe he's the fighter in question? But if he isn't listed, perhaps the claim refers to him as the fighter but not the opponent. Wait, the claim says \"fight 2 fight,\" which might mean a rematch or two fights, but the exact wording is unclear.\n\nLooking at the time of the Miami fight (April 26, 2005), the venue was Radisson Hotel in Miami, Florida. That part checks out. However, since the opponent isn't muhsin corbbrey, and he's not listed as fighting in any other capacity, maybe the claim is referring to him fighting another person who isn't in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"muhsin corbbrey\" was involved but wasn't captured in the table. But without a matching name, it's hard to verify. However, the venue and year do match one of the fights.\n\nSo, the claim says there were two fights in Florida in 2005 by muhsin corbbrey. From the table, only one Miami fight is present where someone else fought. Since muhsin isn't listed as an opponent or fighter elsewhere, it's unclear if he had two fights that year.\n\nBut the main points are: was there a fight in Florida in 2005? Yes. Was it involving muhsin corbbrey? No, based on the opponents listed. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because while a fight did happen in Florida that year, it wasn't involving muhsin corbbrey as per the table data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding \"muhsin corbbrey fight 2 fight.\" Perhaps it's stating that he had two fights, both in Florida in 2005. The table shows only one Miami fight in April 2005, so unless there's another not listed, which isn't the case here, then the claim is false.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be FALSE because while a fight did occur in Florida that year, it wasn't involving muhsin corbbrey as per the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey have never lose a fight in south carolina\" is true or false by checking the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: it's saying that Muhsin Corbbrey has never lost a fight that took place in South Carolina. So I need to look for any fights where he was in South Carolina and check if there's a loss recorded.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight event with various details like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. The key columns here are \"result\" and \"location.\"\n\nI need to focus on rows where the location is South Carolina because that's where the claim is specifically about. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **2009 - 02 - 28**: Location is Hilton Head, SC. Result is a win. So no loss here.\n2. **2006 - 09 - 15**: Location is Mount Pleasant, SC. Result is a win. No loss.\n3. **2006 - 06 - 15**: Location is Glen Burnie, MD. Not South Carolina, so irrelevant for this claim.\n4. **2006 - 04 - 21**: Location is Mount Pleasant, SC. Win again, no loss.\n5. **2006 - 03 - 09**: Glen Burnie, MD. Irrelevant.\n6. **2006 - 01 - 26**: Glen Burnie, MD. Not relevant.\n7. **2005 - 11 - 26**: Upper Marlboro, MD. Doesn't apply.\n8. **2005 - 04 - 26**: Miami, FL. No, so not relevant for SC.\n9. **2005 - 04 - 08**: Port St Lucie, FL. Also irrelevant.\n\nFrom this table, it seems that all the fights in South Carolina (rows 1 and 2) resulted in wins for Muhsin Corbbrey. There's no row where he lost a fight in SC. Therefore, the claim appears to be true because there are no losses recorded in his fights within South Carolina.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows that might have been missed or if perhaps the location was mentioned differently. Let me make sure I didn't skip over any relevant rows.\n\nLooking again, row 0 is Hilton Head, SC (win), row1 is Mount Pleasant, SC (win). All others are either MD, FL, etc., so no other South Carolina fights where he lost. Therefore, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against muhsin corbbrey in 2006.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find all relevant information related to Tim Coleman and his fights in 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. \n\nI'll go through each row for the year 2006 to see if there's a fight involving Tim Coleman against someone named Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\nRow 0: 2009-02-28 \u2013 this is not in 2006, so skip.\nRow 1: 2006-09-15 \u2013 opponent is Ryan Rayonec. No match with Muhsin Corbbrey.\nRow 2: 2006-06-15 \u2013 Tim Coleman's fight. Opponent is Tim Coleman vs. Tim Coleman? Wait, no, the opponent's name here is \"tim coleman\" but that can't be right because he can't fight himself. Maybe it's a typo or mistake. The venue is Michael's Eighth Avenue in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The result is a loss. So this seems to be a loss against Tim Coleman? But that doesn't make sense because you don't have a fighter fighting themselves. Hmm, perhaps the opponent's name is different. Wait, looking closely, it says \"tim coleman\" as both opponent and himself? That can't be correct. Maybe it's a different person with similar name.\n\nWait, let me check each row again.\n\nRow 3: 2006-04-21 \u2013 Opponent is Shelton Barnes.\nRow 4: 2006-03-09 \u2013 Opponent is Kareem Robinson.\nRow 5: 2006-01-26 \u2013 Opponent is Anthony Abrams.\nRow 6: 2005-11-26 \u2013 This is in 2005, so not relevant for 2006.\nRow 7: 2005-04-26 \u2013 Loss against Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez.\nRow 8: 2005-04-08 \u2013 Draw against Ricardo Planter.\n\nWait, I'm only looking at 2006 rows. So the 2006 rows are:\n\n1. 2006-09-15 \u2013 Ryan Rayonec\n2. 2006-06-15 \u2013 Tim Coleman vs someone? Opponent is \"tim coleman\" which seems odd.\n3. 2006-04-21 \u2013 Shelton Barnes\n4. 2006-03-09 \u2013 Kareem Robinson\n5. 2006-01-26 \u2013 Anthony Abrams\n\nSo, the only fight in 2006 where Tim Coleman is involved is row 2 (index 2), where he has a loss against \"tim coleman.\" But that can't be right because an opponent can't be the same fighter.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in the opponent's name. Maybe it's supposed to be Muhsin Corbbrey instead of Tim Coleman? Let me check if any row in 2006 has Tim Coleman fighting against Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\nLooking through each 2006 fight:\n\n- Opponents for Tim Coleman in 2006: none, because the opponents are Ryan Rayonec, Shelton Barnes, Kareem Robinson, and Anthony Abrams. So there's no Muhsin Corbbrey mentioned here.\n\nWait, row 2 has Tim Coleman as opponent? That seems like a mistake or perhaps it's a different fighter with a similar name. The claim is about fighting against Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006. From the table, I don't see any fights by Tim Coleman against that name in 2006.\n\nAdditionally, the only loss for Tim Coleman in 2006 is on row 2, but since the opponent might be a different person (possibly a typo), it's unclear if it's against Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\nSo, according to the table, there's no evidence of Tim Coleman losing a fight against Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against muhsin corbbrey in 2006,\" we examine the table for any fights involving Tim Coleman against Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006. \n\nUpon reviewing the relevant rows, there are no entries where Tim Coleman faced Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006.

Let me break down the claim first: \"muhsin corbbrey fight in 2 fight that last more than 5 round between 2006 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if there's any fighter named Muhsin Corbbrey in the table. Looking at the opponent column, the names listed are troy nelson, ryan rayonec, tim coleman, shelton barnes, kareem robinson, anthony abrams, ben lock, emanuel gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez, and ricardo planter. I don't see Muhsin Corbbrey here, so that's a red flag. Maybe he's not in the table at all.\n\nWait, maybe I misread some of the opponent names. Let me go through each row again: 2009-02-28 vs Troy Nelson, 2006-09-15 vs Ryan Rayonec, 2006-06-15 vs Tim Coleman, and so on. No, none of these opponents are Muhsin Corbbrey. So if the claim is about him fighting in two fights within that timeframe with each lasting more than five rounds, then the answer would be false because he wasn't even present in the table.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the opponent column again: troy nelson, ryan rayonec, tim coleman, shelton barnes, kareem robinson, anthony abrams, ben lock, emanuel gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez, ricardo planter. No, none match Muhsin Corbbrey. So it seems like the claim is about someone not in the table.\n\nAlso, looking at the dates: all fights are between 2005 and 2009, which fits the timeframe mentioned in the claim (between 2006 and 2009). But since Muhsin isn't an opponent, even if he fought two fights lasting more than five rounds, it's irrelevant because he wasn't involved here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.

Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Tim Coleman, Ben Lock, and the year 2006. I should look for any fights involving these two names in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a fight event with various details like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. Let me go through each row in 2006 to check for Tim Coleman and Ben Lock interactions.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- The first win is against Troy Nelson on February 28, 2009. Not relevant since it's not 2006.\n- Next, Ryan Rayonec on September 15, 2006: this is 2006, but opponents are different.\n- Tim Coleman fighting on June 15, 2006: he lost to Tim Coleman? Wait, the opponent here is Tim Coleman? No, looking at the table, the \"opponent\" column for that row says \"tim coleman\". So in row index 2 (third row), date is 2006-06-15. Result is loss, against Tim Coleman. Wait, but the claim is about losing to Ben Lock. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, looking again: The third row's opponent is \"tim coleman\". So on June 15, 2006, someone else fought Tim Coleman and lost. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: date 2009-02-28, result win, opponent Troy Nelson. Not relevant.\nRow 1: 2006-09-15, Ryan Rayonec, won via TKO. Not related to Ben Lock or Tim Coleman vs each other.\nRow 2: 2006-06-15, loss against Tim Coleman? Wait, the opponent is \"tim coleman\", so in this row, someone fought Tim Coleman and lost. So if the result is loss, that means the fighter in this row lost to Tim Coleman. But the claim is about Tim Coleman not losing to Ben Lock in 2006.\n\nRow 3: April 21, 2006, win against Shelton Barnes via TKO. Not relevant.\nRow 4: March 9, 2006, opponent Kareem Robinson, decision unanimous loss? Wait, no, looking at the table, for row 4, date is 2006-03-09, result is win, so the fighter won against Kareem Robinson.\n\nRow 5: January 26, 2006, opponent Anthony Abrams, decision (unanimous) win. Not relevant.\nRow 6: November 26, 2005, Ben Lock as opponent, but date is 2005, not 2006. So in 2005, someone fought Ben Lock and won via decision.\n\nRow 7: April 26, 2005, Emanuel Gonzalez, loss via decision (unanimous). Not relevant.\nRow 8: April 8, 2005, Ricardo Planter, draw. Also not relevant.\n\nWait, so in the table, I don't see any fights between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006. The only time Ben Lock is involved is on November 26, 2005, when someone else (probably not Tim Coleman) fought him and won.\n\nLooking for Tim Coleman's losses: the third row, June 15, 2006, he lost to whom? Wait, no, actually, in that row, the result is \"loss\", but the opponent is \"tim coleman\". So that would mean that on that date, someone else fought Tim Coleman and lost. So Tim Coleman won that fight.\n\nTherefore, in the year 2006, Tim Coleman did not lose any fights against Ben Lock because there's no such row where they faced each other and Coleman lost.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that in 2006, was there a fight between them? Let me check all rows for 2006. Rows with date 2006 are rows 1 (Sep15), 2 (Jun15), 3 (Apr21),4(Mar9),5(Jan26). None of these have Ben Lock as the opponent except row 6, which is November 26, 2005.\n\nSo, in 2006, Tim Coleman didn't lose to Ben Lock because they didn't fight that year. Therefore, the claim that \"Tim Coleman has not lost a fight against Ben Lock in 2006\" would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure there's no other row where Tim Coleman fought Ben Lock and lost.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of fight details, and I need to determine if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"muhsin corbbrey fight in 4 fight that last more than 5 round between 2006 and 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions \"muhsin corbbrey,\" so I need to check if he's involved in any fights listed in this table. Then, it says \"4 fight\"\u2014probably meaning four fights. Next part: \"that last more than 5 round.\" Hmm, that might be a bit unclear. Maybe it means the fights lasted more than five rounds each? Or maybe there's a typo and it refers to the number of rounds in total? But looking at the table, some fights are listed with specific round numbers.\n\nAlso, the timeframe is between 2006 and 2009. So I'll need to look for fights involving Muhsin Corbrey within those years that meet the criteria.\n\nNow, let me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date 02-28-2009, result win vs Troy Nelson. Opponent, venue, etc., but no mention of Muhsin Corbrey.\n2. **Row 1**: Date 09-15-2006, Ryan Rayonec as opponent. Not Muhsin.\n3. **Row 2**: 06-15-2006, loss to Tim Coleman. Opponent is Tim Coleman.\n4. **Row 3**: 04-21-2006, win vs Shelton Barnes. No.\n5. **Row 4**: 03-09-2006, Kareem Robinson as opponent.\n6. **Row 5**: 01-26-2006, Anthony Abrams as opponent.\n7. **Row 6**: 11-26-2005, Ben Lock opponent. Date is 2005, which is outside the timeframe (2006-2009).\n8. **Row 7**: 04-26-2005, Emanuel Gonzalez. Also 2005.\n9. **Row 8**: 04-08-2005, draw with Ricardo Planter. Again, 2005.\n\nSo, from the table, Muhsin Corbrey doesn't seem to be listed as an opponent in any of these fights between 2006 and 2009. All the opponents mentioned are different names like Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if \"muhsin corbbrey\" is a correct name variant or perhaps spelled differently? Looking at the table, all opponents have first names without any similar surnames. So it's unlikely that Muhsin Corbrey is in this list under another spelling or name variation.\n\nTherefore, there are no fights by Muhsin Corbrey in the specified timeframe where he fought four times with each fight lasting more than five rounds. In fact, looking at the 'round' column, most of these fights are in 4-6 rounds except for some decisions which don't specify a number but are likely under 5 or 6.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is not supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "muhsin corbbrey have never lose a fight in maryland",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"muhsin corbbrey have never lose a fight in maryland\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Muhsin Corbrey has never lost a fight that took place in Maryland. So, my task is to check all the fights listed in the table where the location is Maryland and see if any of them resulted in a loss for Corbrey.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with various details like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. The \"location\" column seems to be what I need to focus on specifically since the claim is about fights in Maryland.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where the location is Maryland. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **2009 - 02 - 28**: Location is Hilton Head, South Carolina. Not Maryland.\n2. **2006 - 09 - 15**: Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Again, not Maryland.\n3. **2006 - 06 - 15**: Glen Burnie, Maryland. This one's in Maryland.\n4. **2006 - 04 - 21**: Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Not relevant.\n5. **2006 - 03 - 09**: Glen Burnie, Maryland. Another Maryland fight.\n6. **2006 - 01 - 26**: Glen Burnie, Maryland. Third Maryland fight.\n7. **2005 - 11 - 26**: Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Fourth Maryland fight.\n8. **2005 - 04 - 26**: Miami, Florida. Not Maryland.\n9. **2005 - 04 - 08**: Port St Lucie, Florida. Also not Maryland.\n\nSo, I've identified the rows where the location is Maryland: rows 3, 5, 6, and 7 (corresponding to row indices 2, 4, 5, 6 if we start counting from 0). Wait, actually, looking back at the table:\n\n- Row index 2: 2006-06-15, location Glen Burnie, MD. Result is loss.\n- Row index 3: 2006-04-21, but wait, the date is April 21, 2006? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no, row indices are from 0 to 9 based on the order of the table. Let me list them with their row indices:\n\nRow 0: 2009 - 02 - 28\nRow 1: 2006 - 09 - 15\nRow 2: 2006 - 06 - 15 (Glen Burnie, MD)\nRow 3: 2006 - 04 - 21\nRow 4: 2006 - 03 - 09 (Glen Burnie, MD)\nRow 5: 2006 - 01 - 26 (Glen Burnie, MD)\nRow 6: 2005 - 11 - 26 (Upper Marlboro, MD)\nRow 7: 2005 - 04 - 26\nRow 8: 2005 - 04 - 08\nRow 9: Not applicable since there are only 10 rows.\n\nWait, actually the table has 10 entries. So row indices from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, location is Maryland in rows where:\n\n- Row 2: 2006-06-15 (Glen Burnie)\n- Row 4: 2006-03-09 (Glen Burnie)\n- Row 5: 2006-01-26 (Glen Burnie)\n- Row 6: 2005-11-26 (Upper Marlboro)\n\nNow, for each of these rows, I need to check the \"result\" column.\n\nStarting with row 2 (2006-06-15): Result is loss. So Corbrey lost this fight in Maryland.\n\nIf that's true, then the claim is FALSE because he did lose a fight in Maryland.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nRow indices and their locations:\n\nRow 0: Hilton Head, SC\nRow 1: Mount Pleasant, SC\nRow 2: Glen Burnie, MD (result: loss)\nRow 3: Mount Pleasant, SC\nRow 4: Glen Burnie, MD (win)\nRow 5: Glen Burnie, MD (win)\nRow 6: Upper Marlboro, MD (win)\nRow 7: Miami, FL\nRow 8: Port St Lucie, FL\nRow 9: Not applicable.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the row indices are:\n\nRow 0: Date:2009-02-28, location:Hilton Head, SC\n\nRow 1: 2006-09-15, Mount Pleasant, SC\n\nRow 2: 2006-06-15, Glen Burnie, MD\n\nRow 3: 2006-04-21, Mount Pleasant, SC\n\nRow 4: 2006-03-09, Glen Burnie, MD\n\nRow 5: 2006-01-26, Glen Burnie, MD\n\nRow 6: 2005-11-26, Upper Marlboro, MD\n\nRow 7: 2005-04-26, Miami, FL\n\nRow 8: 2005-04-08, Port St Lucie, FL\n\nSo rows with location Maryland are rows 2,4,5,6.\n\nNow checking their results:\n\n- Row 2: result is loss\n- Row 4: win\n- Row 5: win\n- Row 6: win\n\nSo Corbrey lost at least one fight in Maryland (row 2). Therefore the claim that he didn't lose any is false.\n\nBut wait, is it possible that \"you\" refers to someone else? Wait, no. The task says: You are tasked with responding as if you're an AI assistant.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nList of rows and their locations and results:\n\n1. 2009-02-28: Hilton Head, SC: Win (but it's not MD)\n2. 2006-09-15: Mount Pleasant, SC: Win\n3. 2006-06-15: Glen Burnie, MD: Loss\n4. 2006-04-21: Mount Pleasant, SC: Win\n5. 2006-03-09: Glen Burnie, MD: Win\n6. 2006-01-26: Glen Burnie, MD: Win\n7. 2005-11-26: Upper Marlboro, MD: Win\n8. 2005-04-26: Miami, FL: Loss? Wait, no. Wait, in row 7: result is win.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nOriginal table:\n\nRow 0:\nYou (as the AI) are tasked with examining the data and answering accordingly.\n\nThe data provided shows multiple fights.

Fighter A vs Fighter B\n   - Location: Miami, Florida\n   - Result: Loss?

Fighter A vs Fighter B\n   - Location: Miami, Florida\n   - Result: Loss (I think) [But wait, the initial message might have said 'Loss' here]\n\nWait, in the user's original message, it's written as:\n\n\"Here is a list of fights you have participated in over the last year:\n\n1.
