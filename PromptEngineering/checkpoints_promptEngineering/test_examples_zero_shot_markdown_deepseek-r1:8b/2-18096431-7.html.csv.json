    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"mark brook be the player who earn the most money.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate Mark Brooks in the table. Looking at the first column (place), the first row has mark brooks as the player. So his row index is 0.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much money he earned. In the \"money\" column, Mark Brooks has a value of 430000.\n\nNow, I have to compare this amount with all other players' money columns to see if he's the highest earner.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: mark brooks - $430,000\n- Row 1: kenny perry - $260,000\n- Row 2: steve elkington - $140,000\n- Row 3: tommy tolles - $140,000\n- Row 4: justin leonard - $86,667\n- Row 5: jesper parnevik - $86,667\n- Row 6: vijay singh - $86,667\n- Rows 7 to 11: several players with $57,500.\n\nComparing all these, Mark Brooks' $430,000 is higher than any other player's amount. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should make sure to list the relevant cells for verification. The columns we need are \"place\" and \"money.\" So, the first row (index 0) has the place as 1 and money. That's the only relevant cell because it directly shows Mark Brooks' earnings.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Mark Brooks earned the most money, I identified his row and checked other players' earnings.\n\n- **Mark Brooks**: $430,000\n- Other players have lower amounts.\n\n**Answer**: TRUE  \n**Relevant cells**: Only Mark Brooks' row is needed to confirm he has the highest earnings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Mark Brooks\" and \"Kenneth Perry\" are two players in the table. The term \"tie for have the lowest to par\" suggests that both of them have the same score for \"to par,\" which is a measure related to their performance, possibly golf scores since it's a common term there.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to locate Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry. Scanning through the rows, I see Mark Brooks in row 1 (row_index:0) with a score of 277 and a \"to par\" of -11. Kenny Perry is also in row 2 (row_index:1) with the same total score of 277 but also a \"to par\" of -11.\n\nSo both have the same \"to par\" score, which is -11. The claim says they tie for the lowest to par, implying that their \"to par\" is the smallest or tied for the smallest among all players listed.\n\nTo verify this, I need to check the \"to par\" column for all relevant rows. Let's look at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Mark Brooks -11\n- Row 2: Kenny Perry -11\n- Row3: Steve Elkington -10\n- Row t3: Tommy Tolles -10\n- Row5: Justin Leonard -9, Jesper Parnevik -9, Vijay Singh -9\n- Rows t8 onwards: Lee Janzen, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo, Nick Price all have -8.\n\nSo the \"to par\" scores go from -11 (Mark and Kenny), then some at -10, and several at -9, ending with -8. So -11 is indeed the lowest among all.\n\nTherefore, Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry both have the lowest to par of -11, so they tie for that lowest score. Hence, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: The \"to par\" column is what we're interested in for both players. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Mark Brooks: row 0, \"to par\"\n- For Kenny Perry: row 1, \"to par\"\n\nI think that's all. No other columns are directly relevant here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row corresponds to a different player with their respective details. The claim in question is specifically about Nick Price being the only player from Zimbabwe.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all players listed as being from Zimbabwe. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Mark Brooks from the United States.\n- Row 2: Kenny Perry from the United States.\n- Row t3: Steve Elkington from Australia.\n- Row t3: Tommy Tolles from the United States.\n- Row t5: Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, and Vijay Singh all from different countries.\n- Row t8: Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo, and Nick Price.\n\nOut of these, I'm looking for any player whose country is Zimbabwe. From the table, only one name stands out: Nick Price in row t8 with country Zimbabwe.\n\nThe claim says that Nick Price is the \"only\" player from Zimbabwe. To verify this, I need to check if there's any other player listed as being from Zimbabwe besides Nick Price. \n\nLooking at all the rows again, none of the other players have Zimbabwe as their country. Mark Brooks, Kenny Perry, Steve Elkington, Tommy Tolles, Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh, Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo\u2014all are from different countries except for Nick Price.\n\nTherefore, since there's only one player from Zimbabwe in the table, the claim that Nick Price is the only player from Zimbabwe is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as only Nick Price is listed from Zimbabwe.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning the 'country' column:\n\n- The only player mentioned as \"new zealand\" is in row 12, Frank Nobilo. No other rows have \"new zealand\" as their country.\n\nTherefore, Frank Nobilo is indeed the sole player from New Zealand in this table.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any.

The columns in question here are \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"money.\" Since the claim is about two specific players, Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks, their respective \"money\" values will be crucial.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Mark Brooks is listed in row 1 with a money value of 430,000.\n- Kenny Perry is in row 2 with a money value of 260,000.\n\nThe claim states that Kenny earned $170,000 less than Mark.

Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim in question is about Kenny Perry earning the most money. So my task is to find out if Kenny Perry's money column value is higher than any other player's in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: mark brooks from the United States has a score of 277 and -11, with $430,000.\n2. Row 1: kenny perry also from the US with the same score and to par as Brooks, but he's ranked second, and his money is $260,000.\n3. Row 2: steve elkington from Australia with a higher score of 278, -10, and $140k.\n4. Rows 3 and 4: tommy tolles and justin leonard both are in t5 (tied for fifth) with scores around the same as others but money is $86,667 each.\n5. Rows 5-8: various players including per - ulrik johansson, phil mickelson, larry mize, etc., all tied at t8 with a score of 280 and -8, with each receiving $57,500.\n\nNow, focusing on Kenny Perry's row (row 1), he has $260k. I need to check if any other player in the table earns more than him.\n\nLooking through the rest:\n\n- The top earner is mark brooks with $430k.\n- Then, all others have lower amounts: Steve Elkington at $140k, Justin Leonard and Jesper Parnevik at ~$86k each, and then the t8 players at $57.5k each.\n\nSo Kenny Perry's $260k is less than mark brooks' $430k.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find all players from Zimbabwe. The table lists several columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. My main focus here is the \"country\" column since the claim is about players from a specific country, Zimbabwe.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Row 1: mark brooks - united states\n2. Row 2: kenny perry - united states\n3. Row 3: steve elkington - australia\n4. Row 4: tommy tolles - united states\n5. Row 5: justin leonard - united states\n6. Row 6: jesper parnevik - sweden\n7.

Row 12: frank nobilo - new zealand\n13. Row 13: nick price - zimbabwe\n\nWait, row 13's country is Zimbabwe? Let me check that again. Yes, it says \"zimbabwe\" in the country column for Nick Price.\n\nSo now, let's focus on players from Zimbabwe. From the table, I see:\n\n- Frank Nobilo is listed at t12 with country \"new zealand\". Wait, no, actually row 13 is Nick Price, who is from Zimbabwe.\n\nWait, looking back: Row 12 says \"frank nobilo\" and his country is \"new zealand\", not Zimbabwe. So he's not from Zimbabwe. Then, the next row is t8, but that's Lee Janzen from the US, etc. The last row is t8? Wait, no, the rows go up to t13.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check each row's place:\n\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 2\n- Row 3: t3\n- Row 4: t3\n- Row 5: t5\n- Row 6: t5\n- Row 7: t5\n- Row 8: t8\n- Row 9: t8\n- Row 10: t8\n- Row 11: t8\n- Row 12: t8\n- Row 13: t8 (I think this might be a typo, as the highest place shown is t5 and then t8, but perhaps it's up to t13 or more. Maybe I need to clarify.)\n\nWait, perhaps the table has rows beyond what I initially thought. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the markdown table, each row starts with | place | player ... So the first few are 1,2,t3,t3,t5,t5,t5,t8,t8,t8,t8,t8,t8.\n\nWait, no, the last row is t8 for Nick Price from Zimbabwe. So in the table provided, the only player from Zimbabwe is Nick Price, correct?

So that's one player.\n\nNow, the claim says \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe.\" Frank Nobilo is listed at row 12 with country \"new zealand\". So he's not from Zimbabwe.\n\nTherefore, the claim is saying that Frank Nobilo is the sole player from Zimbabwe, but in reality, it's Nick Price who is from Zimbabwe. So the claim is incorrect because there's another player (Nick Price) also from Zimbabwe besides Frank Nobilo.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically says \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe.\" Since there is another player (Nick Price) from Zimbabwe, this makes the claim false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Frank Nobilo is the sole player from Zimbabwe, but Nick Price is also listed as being from Zimbabwe. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

My main focus will be on the 'player' column for Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks, as well as their respective earnings.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that Mark Brooks is in row 1, with a 'money' value of 430,000. Kenny Perry is in row 2, also from the United States, and his 'money' is listed as 260,000.\n\nThe claim says Kenny Perry earned 170,000 more than Mark Brooks. So, I need to calculate if 260,000 - 430,000 equals 170,000. \n\nWait a minute, subtracting those numbers: 260,000 minus 430,000 would give me -170,000. That's negative, which doesn't make sense when talking about earning more money. So, Kenny Perry actually earned less than Mark Brooks by $170,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Kenny Perry earned $170,000 more than Mark Brooks is false. He earned less, not more.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook,\" we need to check their respective 'money' values in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the rows for both players:**\n   - Mark Brooks is in row index 0 with a money value of 430,000.\n   - Kenny Perry is in row index 1 with a money value of 260,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Kenny's money (260,000) minus Mark's money (430,000) equals -170,000.\n   - A negative result means Kenny earned less, not more.\n\nSince Kenny Perry did not earn more than Mark Brooks by $170,000, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
