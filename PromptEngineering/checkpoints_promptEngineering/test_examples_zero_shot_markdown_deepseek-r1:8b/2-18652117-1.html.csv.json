    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"tony lorick be the running back for oakland.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table. \n\n1. **\"tony lorick\"**: I need to find TONY LORICK in the 'player' column. Scanning through the players: jack concannon, pete beathard, matt snell, bob brown, carl eller, scott appleton, tony lorick, ted davis. Yes, tony lorick is there. \n\n2. **\"be the running back\"**: The position for tony lorick in the table is listed as 'rb', which stands for running back. So that part checks out.\n\n3. **\"for oakland\"**: Looking at the 'team' column, one of the teams is oakland, specifically row 7.\n\nNow, let's map this to the table cells. \n\n- The player is tony lorick, so their row index from the table is 7 (since it's the 7th row). The relevant column here is 'player'.\n- The position is 'rb', which is under the 'position' column in row 7.\n- The team is oakland, which is under the 'team' column in row 7.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n1. row_index: 7, column_name: player\n2. row_index: 7, column_name: position\n3. row_index: 7, column_name: team\n\nPutting it all together, tony lorick is indeed listed as the running back for oakland in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the player from ohio state plays for new york.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any players who went to Ohio State. Let me scan each row:\n\n1. Row 1: jack concannon from boston college.\n2. Row 2: pete beathard from USC.\n3. Row 3: matt snell from ohio state.\n4. Row 4: bob brown from Nebraska.\n5. Row 5: carl eller from Minnesota.\n6. Row 6: scott appleton from Texas.\n7. Row 7: tony lorick from Arizona State.\n8. Row 8: ted davis from Georgia Tech.\n\nSo, the only player from Ohio State is matt snell in row 3.\n\nNow, I need to check if this player plays for New York. Let's look at the team column:\n\n1. boston\n2. kansas city\n3. new york\n4. denver\n5. buffalo\n6. houston\n7. oakland\n8. san diego\n\nMatt snell is on the New York team (row 3). So, he plays for New York.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the player from ohio state plays for new york.\" Since there's a player from Ohio State (matt snell) who does play for New York, the claim should be true. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there any other player from Ohio State? No, only matt snell in row 3. And he is on the new york team. So yes, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the claim and check each condition against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"new york be the team for the player from minnesota who's position be qb.\" \n\nFirst, let me identify the key parts of the claim:\n1. The team is \"new york.\"\n2. The player is from \"minnesota.\"\n3. The player's position is \"qb.\"\n\nI'll need to find a player in the table who meets all three criteria: their position is QB, they are from Minnesota, and their team is New York.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 5 has a player named Carl Eller from Minnesota, with the position DE. That doesn't match because his position is DE, not QB.\n- I need to check each row where the college is Minnesota. From the table, only row 5 (Carl Eller) and possibly others? Wait, looking again, no other players have Minnesota as their college. So only Carl Eller from Minnesota.\n\nNow, check if this player has position QB. His position is DE, so that doesn't fit. Therefore, there's no player in the table who is a QB from Minnesota with New York as their team.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another row. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Boston College, QB.\n- Row 2: USC, QB.\n- Row3: Ohio State, RB.\n- Row4: Nebraska, OT.\n- Row5: Minnesota, DE.\n- Row6: Texas, DT.\n- Row7: Arizona State, RB.\n- Row8: Georgia Tech, LB.\n\nNone of these players from Minnesota have the position QB. The only player from Minnesota is Carl Eller, who plays DE. Therefore, there's no player that fits all three criteria in the table.\n\nHence, the claim is not supported by the table data. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"tony lorick , , be the player who be pick number 7 , by denver.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three things: the player's name (\"tony lorick\"), the team that picked them (\"denver\"), and their position as pick number 7.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each column mentioned in the claim against the relevant cells. The columns are \"player,\" \"team,\" and \"pick.\" \n\nStarting with the player's name: \"tony lorick.\" Scanning through the \"player\" column of the table:\n\n- Row 1: jack concannon\n- Row 2: pete beathard\n- Row 3: matt snell\n- Row 4: bob brown\n- Row 5: carl eller\n- Row 6: scott appleton\n- Row 7: tony lorick\n- Row 8: ted davis\n\nYes, \"tony lorick\" is found in row 7 of the \"player\" column. So that's relevant.\n\nNext, checking which team picked \"tony lorick.\" The claim says it's by \"denver.\" Looking at the \"team\" column:\n\n- Row 1: boston\n- Row 2: kansas city\n- Row 3: new york\n- Row 4: denver\n- Row 5: buffalo\n- Row 6: houston\n- Row 7: oakland\n- Row 8: san diego\n\nWait, \"denver\" is in row 4. However, the player in row 4 is bob brown, not tony lorick. So this might be a confusion here.\n\nBut hold on, the claim refers to pick number 7 being denver's choice for tony lorick. Let me check the \"pick\" column as well because sometimes teams can have multiple picks.\n\nLooking at the \"pick\" column:\n\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 2\n- Row 3: 3\n- Row 4: 4\n- Row 5: 5\n- Row 6: 6\n- Row 7: 7\n- Row 8: 8\n\nYes, row 7 has pick number 7. But according to the table, row 7 is for oakland and player tony lorick.\n\nSo there's a conflict here. The claim says denver picked tony at number 7, but in the table, denver is at pick 4 with bob brown. Meanwhile, oakland is at pick 7 with tony.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because it associates tony lorick with denver's pick 7 when, according to the table, he was picked by oakland at number 7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"tony lorick\" was picked by \"denver\" as pick number 7. However, the table shows that \"denver\" picked \"bob brown\" at pick 4, and \"oakland\" picked \"tony lorick\" at pick 7.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
