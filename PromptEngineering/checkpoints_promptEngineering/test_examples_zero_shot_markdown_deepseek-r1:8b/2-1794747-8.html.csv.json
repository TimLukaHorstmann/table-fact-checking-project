    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this table with various awards and their results. The claim is that Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 2013. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. It has columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. The rows are individual entries with specific data.\n\nThe claim mentions Imelda Staunton, so I should find her name in the 'nominee' column. Scanning through the rows, I see that Imelda Staunton is listed as a nominee in the 2013 row under the 'best actress in a musical' category. That's relevant because it directly ties to the claim.\n\nNext, the award in question is the Laurence Olivier Award. Looking at the 'award ceremony' column for 2013, I see that all entries are for the Laurence Olivier Award. So this part of the claim is also correct.\n\nNow, checking the category: the claim specifies 'best actress in a musical'. In the table, under 2013, there's a row where the category is exactly that. This matches perfectly.\n\nLooking at the result column for Imelda Staunton's entry, it's marked as 'won'. So she did win that award in 2013 for the best actress category in a musical. \n\nPutting this all together, each part of the claim checks out against the table. There's no discrepancy or inconsistency in the data provided. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I analyzed each relevant cell in the table to verify the claim.\n\nThe claim states that Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 2013. By cross-referencing the table:\n\n1. **Year**: 2013\n2. **Award Ceremony**: Laurence Olivier Award\n3. **Category**: Best Actress in a Musical\n4. **Nominee**: Imelda Staunton\n5. **Result**: Won\n\nAll these details align perfectly with the claim, confirming its validity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. The table has several columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. I'm going to scan each row to see if any of them match the claim.\n\nLooking at the first row, the year is 2012. That's relevant because the claim mentions 2012. Now, the award ceremony for that year is \"evening standard award.\" The category is \"best musical,\" and the nominee is also \"best musical,\" so that doesn't seem to match the claim.\n\nNext, moving on to 2013. There are several entries here, but they all have the award ceremony as \"laurence olivier award.\" The claim specifically mentions the year 2012, so I should focus only on rows where the year is 2012.\n\nSo, in 2012, the only row is the first one: 2012, evening standard award, best musical, best musical, won. The nominee here is \"best musical,\" which is a category, not a person's name. The claim says \"imelda staunton,\" who is an individual. So there's no match in 2012.\n\nWait, but the claim is about being a nominee in 2012. Looking again at 2012's row, the result is \"won,\" meaning that in 2012, for the category of best musical, they won, not nominated. The claim says she was a nominee in 2012, which would require her name to be listed as the nominee with a result of \"nominated.\"\n\nBut since there's no row for Imelda Staunton in 2012, the claim isn't supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: only the first row (row_index 0) and the column \"nominee\" because that's where we check if her name appears. So the relevant cells are row 0, column nominee.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
