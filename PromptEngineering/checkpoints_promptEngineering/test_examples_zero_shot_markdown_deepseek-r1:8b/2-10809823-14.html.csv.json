    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Prince Park being one of the six venues used on June 28, 1980 is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"Prince Park be 1 of the 6 venue that be put to use on 28 june 1980.\" So, I need to check if Prince Park is listed as a venue for that date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and the date. The columns are: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll focus on the 'venue' column specifically for the date June 28, 1980. So, I need to go through each row where the date is \"28 june 1980\" and see which venues are listed.\n\nChecking each row:\n\n1. Geelong vs North Melbourne at Kardinia Park.\n2. Footscray vs Melbourne at Western Oval.\n3. Hawthorn vs Fitzroy at Princes Park.\n4. Richmond vs Collingwood at MCG.\n5. South Melbourne vs Carlton at Lake Oval.\n6. St Kilda vs Essendon at VFL Park.\n\nSo, the venues for that date are: Kardinia Park, Western Oval, Princes Park, MCG, Lake Oval, and VFL Park. I don't see Prince Park in this list.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Prince Park.\" Is there a possibility of a typo? Let me check if any venue is spelled as \"Princes Park\" because that's what's listed in the table. The third row lists Princes Park. Maybe the claim meant Princes Park instead of Prince Park.\n\nIf the claim refers to Prince Park, and the table has Princes Park, then it would be incorrect. So, the correct answer is that Prince Park isn't one of the venues used on that date, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Prince Park be 1 of the 6 venue that be put to use on 28 june 1980,\" we need to check if Prince Park appears in the 'venue' column for that specific date.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look at each row where the date is \"28 june 1980.\"\n2. **Examine Venue Column:** Check the 'venue' cell in those rows.\n3. **Compare with Claim:** The claim mentions \"Prince Park,\" so we look for that exact name.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The 'venue' column lists Kardinia Park, Western Oval, Princes Park, MCG, Lake Oval, and VFL Park for June 28, 1980.\n- Prince Park is not listed; instead, it's spelled as \"Princes Park.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** Since Prince Park isn't among the venues used that day, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the Western Oval venue having a lower crowd participation compared to Kardinia Park is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant to verifying this claim. The claim mentions two venues: Western Oval and Kardinia Park. So, I need to find their respective crowd numbers from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, including details like scores, venue, crowd, and date. Kardinia Park is listed as the venue for Geelong's game against North Melbourne with 21555 attendees. Western Oval is another venue; looking through the rows, I see that Footscray plays at Western Oval against Melbourne with a crowd of 11785.\n\nNow, to compare these two numbers: 11785 (Western Oval) and 21555 (Kardinia Park). Since 11785 is less than 21555, it means Western Oval had fewer people attending. Therefore, the claim that Western Oval has lower crowd participation compared to Kardinia Park seems to be TRUE.\n\nSo, I need to extract the relevant cells: the row indices and column names for both venues. For Kardinia Park, which is Geelong's game, it's in row 0, column \"crowd\". For Western Oval, Footscray's game is in row 1, same column \"crowd\".\n\nPutting this all together, I'll structure the JSON response accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare the crowd numbers for Western Oval and Kardinia Park. The data shows that Western Oval had fewer attendees (11785) than Kardinia Park's 21555.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"north melbourne away team record an away score of 4.3 (27) while melbourne record an away score of 6.7 (43).\" So, I need to check two things here: whether north Melbourne scored 4.3 (27) as an away team and whether Melbourne scored 6.7 (43) as an away team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details about both the home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date. My focus should be on the \"away team\" and \"away team score\" columns for north Melbourne and Melbourne.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to find these specific entries.\n\n1. First row: Home team is geelong, away team is north melbourne with a score of 4.3 (27). That's exactly what the claim says about north melbourne. So this cell is relevant.\n\n2. Next, I need to check if Melbourne as an away team scored 6.7 (43). Let me scan through each row looking for \"melbourne\" in the away team column.\n\nLooking at the second row: Home team is footscray, away team is melbourne with a score of 6.7 (43). That's a match where Melbourne was the away team and scored exactly what's stated in the claim. So this cell is also relevant.\n\nWait, but there's another consideration. The date for these matches is June 28, 1980. Does that matter? Well, the claim doesn't mention the date, so it's not part of the verification process here.\n\nSo, both conditions are met: north Melbourne scored 4.3 (27) away and Melbourne scored 6.7 (43) away. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with the table data provided. Both scores match the specified teams' performances as away teams on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in front of me, and I need to determine whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"During the 1980 VFL season, McG venue recorded the highest crowd participation.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The VFL, Victorian Football League, was a competition in Australia, so this is about a specific season. The claim is specifically about the McG venue having the highest crowd participation during that season.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The date for all these matches is June 28, 1980, so they're all from the same day in the 1980 VFL season.\n\nThe key here is to find out which games were played at McG. So I need to look through each row and identify where the venue is listed as McG. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Geelong vs North Melbourne: venue is Kardinia Park.\n2. Footscray vs Melbourne: Western Oval.\n3. Hawthorn vs Fitzroy: Princes Park.\n4. Richmond vs Collingwood: McG.\n5. South Melbourne vs Carlton: Lake Oval.\n6. St Kilda vs Essendon: VFL Park.\n\nSo only the fourth row has the venue as McG. That's Richmond playing against Collingwood at McG with a crowd of 64,054 people.\n\nNow, the claim is about whether McG had the highest crowd participation in that season. To verify this, I need to check if the crowd number for McG is higher than all other venues listed in the table.\n\nLet me list out the crowds from each game:\n\n- Geelong: 21,555\n- Footscray: 11,785\n- Hawthorn: 8,209\n- Richmond (McG): 64,054\n- South Melbourne: 12,362\n- St Kilda: 20,485\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest crowd is definitely Richmond's game at McG with 64,054. None of the other venues have a higher number than that.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because McG did have the highest crowd participation in the 1980 VFL season based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim about Prince Park not being the venue with the lowest crowd participation on June 28, 1980 is true or false. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The date in question is June 28, 1980. I need to focus on that specific date because the claim is about that day.\n\nLooking at the 'venue' column, one of the venues is Prince Park, which corresponds to the row for Hawthorn vs. Fitzroy. The crowd number for Prince Park is 8209 people.\n\nNow, the claim says that Prince Park is \"not the venue with the lowest crowd participation.\" So, I need to check if any other venue had a lower crowd number on that date than Prince Park.\n\nTo do this, I'll compare the 'crowd' column across all entries for June 28, 1980. Let's list out the crowd numbers:\n\n- Geelong: 21555\n- Footscray: 11785\n- Hawthorn (Prince Park): 8209\n- Richmond: 64054\n- South Melbourne: 12362\n- St Kilda: 20485\n\nNow, I'll find the lowest number in this list. Let's see:\n\nThe numbers are 21555, 11785, 8209, 64054, 12362, and 20485.\n\nLooking at these, the smallest is 8209, which is for Prince Park. So, if Prince Park had the lowest crowd participation, then the claim that it \"is not\" the venue with the lowest would be false because it actually was the lowest.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes when looking for the minimum, it's easy to overlook numbers. Let's order them from smallest to largest:\n\n- 8209 (Prince Park)\n- 11785\n- 12362\n- 20485\n- 21555\n- 64054\n\nYes, that confirms Prince Park had the lowest crowd with 8,209 attendees.\n\nSo, the claim states that Prince Park is \"not\" the venue with the lowest. But since it was the lowest, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the 'crowd' column for all entries on June 28, 1980. The lowest crowd number is at Prince Park, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim mentions \"vfl park\" and \"lake oval,\" so I need to find the corresponding crowd numbers for these venues. The column that shows the number of participants or attendees is \"crowd.\"\n\nSo, I'll look for rows where the venue is either vfl park or lake oval. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. First row: venue is kardinia park.\n2. Second row: western oval.\n3. Third row: princes park.\n4. Fourth row: mcg.\n5. Fifth row: lake oval.\n6. Sixth row: vfl park.\n\nSo, relevant rows are the fifth and sixth ones (index 5 and 6 in a zero-based index? Wait, actually, in the table, the first row is index 0. So, fifth row would be index 4? Let me count:\n\n- Row 0: geelong\n- Row 1: footscray\n- Row 2: hawthorn\n- Row 3: richmond\n- Row 4: south melbourne\nWait, no. Wait the table has six rows. The fifth row is index 5? Let me count again:\n\nLooking at the markdown table, each | ... | represents a new cell, but the numbering of the rows is from top to bottom as 0 to n-1. So, in the given table:\n\nRow 0: geelong\nRow 1: footscray\nRow 2: hawthorn\nRow 3: richmond\nRow 4: south melbourne\nRow 5: st kilda\n\nWait no, that's not correct. The first row after headers is the geelong row as row 0, then second is footscray (row1), third hawthorn (row2), fourth richmond (row3), fifth south melbourne (row4), sixth st kilda (row5). So yes, the fifth and sixth rows are at indices 4 and 5.\n\nSo, for vfl park: it's in row 5. For lake oval: it's in row 4.\n\nNow, checking the crowd numbers:\n\n- For vfl park (row 5): crowd is 20485.\n- For lake oval (row 4): crowd is 12362.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"vfl park venue record 8123 more crowd participant than that of the lake oval.\" So it's saying vfl park had a crowd number higher by 8123. Let me see:\n\nvfl park: 20485\nlake oval: 12362\n\nDifference is 20485 - 12362 = 8123. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the \"crowd\" columns for both vfl park and lake oval venues.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the crowd numbers in the table.

The claim says: \"western oval venue record a lower crowd participation and host a lower away scorer team than that of the kardinia park venue.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Western Oval has lower crowd participation compared to Kardinia Park.\n2. Western Oval hosts a lower away scorer team than Kardinia Park.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check the relevant columns for each part of the claim. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, and crowd. \n\nFor the first part about crowd participation, the \"crowd\" column is relevant. I'll compare the crowd numbers at Western Oval and Kardinia Park. From the table:\n- Western Oval has a crowd of 11785.\n- Kardinia Park has a crowd of 21555.\n\nSo, Western Oval's crowd (11,785) is indeed lower than Kardinia Park's (21,555). That part checks out.\n\nNext, for hosting a lower away scorer team. I need to see the away teams and their scores at each venue. The relevant columns here are \"away team\" and \"away score.\" \n\nLooking for Western Oval: In the second row, the away team is Melbourne with 6.7 (43). For Kardinia Park, in the first row, the away team is North Melbourne with 4.3 (27).\n\nNow, I'm a bit confused because lower scorer might mean a lower score by the away team or a smaller number of points. The term \"lower away scorer team\" could be interpreted as the away team's score being lower than that of Kardinia Park.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Western Oval: Away team scored 6.7 (43).\n- Kardinia Park: Away team scored 4.3 (27).\n\nSo, Western Oval actually has a higher away score (43) compared to Kardinia Park's 27. This means that Western Oval's away scorer is not lower; it's higher.\n\nWait, the claim says Western Oval hosts a lower away scorer team than Kardinia Park. But according to the numbers, Kardinia Park's away scorers are lower than Western Oval's. Therefore, the second part of the claim is FALSE.\n\nSince both parts must be true for the overall claim to be TRUE, and one part is false, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: crowd participation and away scorer team.

The claim says: \"During the 1980 VFL season, McG be not the venue with the highest crowd participation.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about the 1980 VFL season and the venues' crowd numbers. The key points here are:\n1. The year is 1980.\n2. It's the VFL season.\n3. McG is not the venue with the highest crowd participation.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that all the matches are from June 28, 1980. So the date aligns with the claim's timeframe.\n\nNext, I need to check which venues are present in the table. The venues listed are:\n- Kardinia Park\n- Western Oval\n- Princes Park\n- MCG\n- Lake Oval\n- VFL Park\n\nEach row has a home team and their score, along with the away team's details, venue, crowd number, and date.\n\nThe claim is specifically about McG not being the highest. So I need to find which venue had the highest crowd participation in that season based on the table.\n\nLooking at each row's crowd number:\n- Kardinia Park: 21555\n- Western Oval: 11785\n- Princes Park: 8209\n- MCG: 64054\n- Lake Oval: 12362\n- VFL Park: 20485\n\nNow, comparing these numbers, the highest crowd is at MCG with 64,054 attendees. The claim says that McG \"be not\" the venue with the highest participation, but according to the table, it actually was the highest.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim might be saying that McG was NOT the venue with the highest crowd. But from the data, MCG did have the highest. So the claim is incorrect because it says McG isn't the highest, but in reality, it was.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim is wrong. Then, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The cell related is the crowd number for MCG, which is in the row where home team is Richmond and away is Collingwood.

First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that both VFL Park and Lake Oval are ranked in the top three venues based on crowd numbers. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game between two teams, including details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue name, crowd number, and date. The relevant columns here would be \"venue\" and \"crowd.\" Since the claim is about the venues' rankings based on crowd numbers, I need to identify which rows have these venues and then check their crowd figures.\n\nStarting with VFL Park: Scanning through each row's venue column, I find that VFL Park is listed in the last row where St Kilda is the home team. The crowd number for that game was 20,485. \n\nNext, Lake Oval: Checking the venues again, Lake Oval is mentioned in the fifth row, where South Melbourne is the home team. Their crowd count was 12,362.\n\nNow, I need to compare these crowd numbers with others to see if they are among the top three. Let me list out all the crowd numbers:\n\n- Kardinia Park: 21,555\n- Western Oval: 11,785\n- Princes Park: 8,209\n- MCG: 64,054\n- Lake Oval: 12,362\n- VFL Park: 20,485\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me go through each row again:\n\n1. geelong vs north melbourne at Kardinia Park: 21,555\n2. footscray vs melbourne at Western Oval: 11,785\n3. hawthorn vs fitzroy at Princes Park: 8,209\n4. richmond vs collingwood at MCG: 64,054\n5. south melbourne vs carlton at Lake Oval: 12,362\n6. st kilda vs essendon at VFL Park: 20,485\n\nSo the crowd numbers are as follows:\n\n- Kardinia Park: 21,555\n- Western Oval: 11,785\n- Princes Park: 8,209\n- MCG: 64,054\n- Lake Oval: 12,362\n- VFL Park: 20,485\n\nNow, let me rank these crowd numbers from highest to lowest:\n\n1. MCG: 64,054\n2. Kardinia Park: 21,555\n3. VFL Park: 20,485\n4. Lake Oval: 12,362\n5. Western Oval: 11,785\n6. Princes Park: 8,209\n\nSo the top three crowd numbers are MCG (1st), Kardinia Park (2nd), and VFL Park (3rd). The claim mentions both VFL Park and Lake Oval as being in the top three. But from this ranking, Lake Oval is only 4th with 12,362 attendees, which isn't among the top three.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both VFL Park and Lake Oval are ranked among the top three crowd venues is FALSE because while VFL Park is indeed third, Lake Oval is fourth.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both VFL Park and Lake Oval are among the top three venues based on crowd numbers. After analyzing the data, VFL Park ranks third with 20,485 attendees, but Lake Oval only has 12,362, which doesn't make it into the top three.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away game venue be both among the top 4 crowd venues.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is asking. It\u2019s about two specific teams\u2014Melbourne as a home team and North Melbourne as an away team\u2014specifically looking at their away games' venues and whether those venues are among the top four in terms of crowd size.\n\nLooking at the table, I should identify where Melbourne and North Melbourne are playing as away or home teams. Wait, actually, the claim mentions \"Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away game venue.\" So for each team, I need to find their away games' venues and check if those venues are among the top four crowd numbers.\n\nSo let me look through the table:\n\n1. **Melbourne as the away team:**\n   - I'll scan down the \"away team\" column.\n   - The first row has North Melbourne as the home team, so that's not relevant for Melbourne's away games.\n   - Continue until I find Melbourne listed in the \"away team\" column. Let me check each row:\n\n   - Row 1: North Melbourne is home.\n   - Row 2: Footscray is home; away team is Melbourne (since row 2 has away team as melbourne).\n   - So, Footscray vs. Melbourne at Western Oval on June 28, 1980 with a crowd of 11785.\n\n2. **North Melbourne as the away team:**\n   - Now I look for North Melbourne in the \"away team\" column.\n   - Row 0 has geelong as home; away is North Melbourne.\n   - So that's Geelong vs. North Melbourne at Kardinia Park with a crowd of 21555.\n\nSo, the claim refers to two specific away games:\n- Melbourne's away game at Western Oval (crowd 11785)\n- North Melbourne's away game at Kardinia Park (crowd 21555)\n\nNext, I need to determine if both of these venues are among the top four crowd sizes in the table.\n\nLooking at all the \"crowd\" numbers:\n\nThe crowds are:\n- 8209 (Hawthorn home)\n- 64054 (Richmond home)\n- 11785 (Melbourne away)\n- 12362 (South Melbourne away)\n- 20485 (St Kilda away)\n- 21555 (North Melbourne away)\n\nNow, list all crowd numbers in descending order to find the top four:\n1. 64054\n2. 23485 (St Kilda)\n3. 21555\n4. 12362\n\nWait, let me sort them correctly:\n\n- 64054 is highest.\n- Next, St Kilda has 20485.\n- Then North Melbourne at 21555? Wait no, 21555 is higher than 20485, so correct order would be:\n\n1. 64054 (Richmond)\n2. 21555 (North Melbourne away)\n3. 23485 (St Kilda)\n4. 12362 (South Melbourne)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 21555 is less than 23485. Let me list them properly.\n\nWait no: 64054 is highest. Then the next highest is 23485 (St Kilda), then 21555 (North Melbourne away), then 12362 (South Melbourne). Wait, but 21555 is higher than 20485 (St Kilda's home game). So the order should be:\n\n1. 64054\n2. 23485\n3. 21555\n4. 12362\n\nWait no, wait: Let me list all crowd numbers again:\n\n- Geelong: 21555 (away)\n- Footscray: 11785 (home vs Melbourne away)\n- Hawthorn: 8209 (home)\n- Richmond: 64054 (home)\n- South Melbourne: 12362 (away vs Carlton)\n- St Kilda: 20485 (away)\n\nSo the top four crowds are:\n1. 64054\n2. 23485\n3. 21555\n4. 12362\n\nWait, that can't be right because 21555 is higher than 20485. So yes, the order is:\n\n- Richmond: 64054\n- St Kilda away: 23485 (but wait, no, St Kilda's crowd is 20485 as an away team, not home)\n  \nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at each row's crowd number:\n\n1. Geelong home: 21555\n2. Footscray home: 11785 vs Melbourne\n3. Hawthorn home: 8209\n4. Richmond home: 64054\n5. South Melbourne home: 12362 vs Carlton\n6. St Kilda home: 20485\n\nWait, actually, the crowd numbers are for each game, regardless of home or away.\n\nSo list all crowd numbers:\n\n- 21555 (Geelong)\n- 11785 (Footscray)\n- 8209 (Hawthorn)\n- 64054 (Richmond)\n- 12362 (South Melbourne)\n- 20485 (St Kilda)\n\nNow, sort them in descending order:\n\n1. 64054\n2. 23485 (Wait, no St Kilda's crowd is 20485.)\n3. 21555\n4. 12362\n\nSo the top four are:\n\n1. Richmond: 64054\n2. Geelong: 21555\n3. St Kilda: 20485\n4. South Melbourne: 12362\n\nWait, no\u2014St Kilda's crowd is 20485 which is less than 21555. So the correct order after Richmond is:\n\n2. Geelong: 21555\n3. St Kilda: 20485\n4. South Melbourne: 12362\n\nSo the top four are:\n\n1. Richmond: 64054\n2. Geelong: 21555\n3. St Kilda: 20485\n4. South Melbourne: 12362\n\nWait, but wait\u2014no, Geelong's crowd is 21555 when they played North Melbourne away, and St Kilda's is 20485 as a home game.\n\nSo the top four are:\n\n- Richmond: 64054 (home)\n- Geelong: 21555 (away vs North Melbourne)\n- St Kilda: 20485 (home vs Essendon)\n- South Melbourne: 12362 (home vs Carlton)\n\nTherefore, the claim says that both Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away game venues are among the top four.\n\nMelbourne's away game is at Western Oval with crowd 11785. Is this in the top four? Let's see:\n\nTop four crowds: 64054, 21555, 20485, 12362. So 11785 is lower than all of these except maybe South Melbourne's 12362, but still not in the top four.\n\nWait no, because 11785 is less than 12362, so it's ranked lower. The top four are:\n\n1. 64054\n2. 21555 (Geelong)\n3. 20485\n4. 12362\n\nSo Melbourne's away game is at 11785, which isn't in the top four.\n\nNorth Melbourne's away game is at Geelong with crowd 21555, which is second in the top four.\n\nSo the claim says both are among the top four. But Melbourne's is not; only North Melbourne's is.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because only one of them is in the top four.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nThe top crowd numbers are:\n\n- Richmond: 64054\n- Geelong (away vs North Melbourne): 21555\n- St Kilda (home): 20485\n- South Melbourne (home): 12362\n\nSo the top four are these four games. So Melbourne's away game is at Footscray with 11785, which is not in the top four.\n\nTherefore, only North Melbourne's away game is in the top four. So the claim that both are is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all crowd numbers again:\n\n- Geelong: 21555 (away vs North Melbourne)\n- Footscray: 11785 (home vs Melbourne)\n- Hawthorn: 8209 (home)\n- Richmond: 64054 (home)\n- South Melbourne: 12362 (home vs Carlton)\n- St Kilda: 20485 (home)\n\nSo the top four are:\n\n1. Richmond: 64054\n2. Geelong: 21555\n3. St Kilda: 20485\n4. South Melbourne: 12362\n\nThus, only North Melbourne's away game is in the top four.\n\nTherefore, the original claim that both are among the top four is incorrect because only one of them is.\n\nSo the answer would be that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that both Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away games are among the top four attended matches. Upon analyzing the crowd numbers:\n\n- **Melbourne's away game** at Footscray had 11,785 attendees, which does not rank in the top four.\n- **North Melbourne's away game** against Geelong had 21,555 attendees, ranking second in the top four.\n\nSince only one of the two games meets the criteria, the statement is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because only North Melbourne's away game is among the top four most attended matches.",
