    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest no built be class j1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"no built\" likely refers to some measure of how many units were not built for each class. In the context of locomotives, this might relate to the number of locomotives not constructed or perhaps something else like cancellation. \n\nThe claim is saying that the lowest \"no built\" figure comes from class j1. So I need to look at the table and find the \"no built\" column. According to the table structure:\n\n| class   | wheels     | date      |   no built | loco nos          |\n\nEach row represents a different class, with corresponding values for wheels, dates, no built, and locomotive numbers.\n\nNow, I need to check each row's \"no built\" value. Let me list them out:\n\n- h1: No value provided (blank)\n- c3: 10\n- i1: 20\n- i2: 10\n- i3: 27\n- i4: No value provided (blank)\n- j1: 1\n- h2: 6\n\nWait, but in the table, I see that some cells under \"no built\" are marked with numbers and some have other notations. For example, class c3 has a \"no built\" of 10, i1 is 20, etc.\n\nLooking at the \"no built\" column:\n\n- h1: empty\n- c3: 10\n- i1: 20\n- i2: 10\n- i3: 27\n- i4: empty\n- j1: 1\n- h2: 6\n\nThe lowest number here is 1, which corresponds to class j1. So the claim says that the lowest \"no built\" is for j1, which seems correct.\n\nBut I should also consider if any other class has a lower value. Since all other numbers are higher or missing (like h1 and h2 have 5 and 6, but those might be different). Wait, no\u2014looking at the table again:\n\nWait, in the \"no built\" column for class j1, it's 1, which is indeed the smallest number among the filled cells. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to point out which row and column are used to verify this. The key data points are the \"no built\" values in each row. Therefore, the relevant_cells would include all rows where \"no built\" is present because we're checking if j1 has the lowest.\n\nSo, the rows with \"no built\" filled or meaningful numbers are c3 (row index 1), i1 (2), i2 (3), i3 (4), j1 (6), and h2 (7). The ones without values are h1 and i4, but since they don't contribute to the comparison, perhaps only rows with data should be included.\n\nWait, but in the claim, we're specifically looking at class j1. So maybe only that row is relevant? Or all rows where \"no built\" is present because we need to confirm that none have a lower value than j1.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about j1 being the lowest, the relevant cells would be the entire \"no built\" column for each row except those without data. Because we need to check all possibilities.\n\nBut looking back at the instruction, it says to identify which cells are relevant to verify the claim. Since we're checking if j1's no built is the lowest, we should look at all rows that have a no built value and confirm that j1's 1 is indeed the smallest among them.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be the \"no built\" column for each row with data. That includes c3 (row 1), i1 (2), i2 (3), i3 (4), j1 (6), h2 (7). Additionally, perhaps h1 and i4 have empty cells, but since their no built isn't specified, they don't affect the comparison.\n\nWait, but in the table, for h1, \"no built\" is marked as 5. Wait, looking back: \n\nIn the markdown table, under \"no built\", I see that class c3 has 10, i1 has 20, i2 has 10, i3 has 27, j1 has 1, and h2 has 6. Also, h1 and i4 have their own no built values: for h1 it's 5? Or is the \"no built\" column empty for h1? Wait, in the table provided:\n\nLooking at the markdown again:\n\nFor h1 row: |   no built | loco nos\nSo the cell under \"no built\" is empty. Similarly, i4 has an empty cell.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me list all \"no built\" values correctly:\n\n- h1: empty (so not considered)\n- c3: 10\n- i1:20\n- i2:10\n- i3:27\n- i4:empty\n- j1:1\n- h2:6\n\nSo the filled no built values are 10,20,10,27,1,6. The lowest is 1 in j1.\n\nTherefore, to verify this claim, I need to look at all rows where \"no built\" has a value and check that none of them have a lower number than 1.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all the \"no built\" entries because we're comparing across classes. So for each row with a no built value (c3, i1, i2, i3, j1, h2), their respective \"row_index\" and column_name (\"no built\") should be included.\n\nSo in JSON terms:\n\nrelevant_cells = [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, the rows are indexed starting from 0. Let me check:\n\nRow 0: h1\nRow 1: c3\nRow 2: i1\nRow 3: i2\nRow 4: i3\nRow 5: i4\nRow 6: j1\nRow 7: h2\n\nSo yes, the rows with no built data are rows 1 to 7 except row 0 and 5.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include rows 1 (c3), 2 (i1), 3 (i2),4 (i3),6 (j1),7 (h2).\n\nEach of these has a \"no built\" value, so they are relevant to check that j1 indeed has the lowest.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those six rows' no built columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"highest no built\" likely refers to the maximum number of locomotives built for each class. So, I need to look at the \"no built\" column in the table and find out which class has the highest value there.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n| class   | wheels     | date      |   no built | loco nos          |\n|:--------|:-----------|:----------|-----------:|:------------------|\n| h1      | 4 - 4 - 2  | 1905 - 6  |          5 | 37 - 41           |\n| c3      | 0 - 6 - 0  | 1906      |         10 | 300 - 309         |\n| i1      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1906 - 7  |         20 | 1 - 10595 - 604   |\n| i2      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1907 - 8  |         10 | 11 - 20           |\n| i3      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1907 - 13 |         27 | 21 - 30 , 75 - 91 |\n| i4      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1908      |          5 | 31 - 35           |\n| j1      | 4 - 6 - 2t | 1910      |          1 | 325               |\n| h2      | 4 - 4 - 2  | 1911 - 2  |          6 | 421 - 6           |\n\nI see that the \"no built\" column has values like 5, 10, 20, 27, 5, 1, 6. The highest number here is 27, which corresponds to class i3.\n\nSo, the claim says that the highest \"no built\" is for class i3, which seems correct based on the table data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this claim. The key column is \"no built,\" and we're focusing on row i3. So, the relevant_cells would include both the \"no built\" value for i3 and possibly the class identifier to confirm it's i3.\n</think>\n\nThe highest number in the \"no built\" column is 27, which belongs to class i3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the only class with wheel 0 - 6 - 0 be c3\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find where the wheel column has the value 0 - 6 - 0. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row h1: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2\n- Row c3: wheels are 0 - 6 - 0\n- Row i1: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t\n- Row i2: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t\n- Row i3: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t\n- Row i4: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t\n- Row j1: wheels are 4 - 6 - 2t\n- Row h2: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2\n\nSo, only the c3 class has the wheel combination 0 - 6 - 0. \n\nNow, I need to check if any other classes have this same wheel value. From the table, it seems that only c3 does. So the claim says \"the only class\" with that wheel is c3, which appears to be correct.\n\nWait, but I should double-check each row to make sure there's no other class with 0 -6-0 wheels. The rows h1, i1-i4, j1, and h2 don't have that value in the wheels column. So yes, only c3 has 0 -6-0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because only c3 has that wheel configuration.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only the c3 class has a specific wheel type (0 - 6 - 0). Upon reviewing each row of the table, only the c3 row matches this wheel type. No other classes have this combination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wheels\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"there be 7 fewer i1 build than i3.\" So, the claim is saying that the number of i1 builds is 7 less than the number of i3 builds.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant data for i1 and i3. The table has several columns: class, wheels, date, no built, and loco nos. Since the claim is about the count of builds (no built), I should focus on that column for both classes i1 and i3.\n\nLet me locate i1 and i3 in the table:\n\n- For i1, the relevant row seems to be the third one (i1) with a \"no built\" value of 20.\n- For i3, it's the fifth row (i3) with a \"no built\" value of 27.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The table is:\n\n| class   | wheels     | date      |   no built | loco nos          |\n|:--------|:-----------|:----------|-----------:|:------------------|\n| h1      | 4 - 4 - 2  | 1905 - 6  |          5 | 37 - 41           |\n| c3      | 0 - 6 - 0  | 1906      |         10 | 300 - 309         |\n| i1      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1906 - 7  |         20 | 1 - 10595 - 604   |\n| i2      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1907 - 8  |         10 | 11 - 20           |\n| i3      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1907 - 13 |         27 | 21 - 30 , 75 - 91 |\n| i4      | 4 - 4 - 2t | 1908      |          5 | 31 - 35           |\n| j1      | 4 - 6 - 2t | 1910      |          1 | 325               |\n| h2      | 4 - 4 - 2  | 1911 - 2  |          6 | 421 - 6           |\n\nSo, i1 is row index 2 (since it starts from 0). The \"no built\" for i1 is 20.\n\ni3 is row index 4. Its \"no built\" is 27.\n\nNow, the claim says that there are 7 fewer i1 builds than i3. So, we need to see if 20 equals 27 minus 7. Let's calculate: 27 - 7 = 20. Yes, that matches. Therefore, the claim is true because 20 (i1) is indeed 7 less than 27 (i3).\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other factors or columns that might affect this comparison. The wheels and date columns don't relate to the number of builds; they describe specifications and timing. The loco nos column lists numbers, but it's about specific locomotives, not total builds. So, \"no built\" is the correct column to compare.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those in row indices 2 (i1) and 4 (i3), specifically under the \"no built\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that i1 has 7 fewer builds than i3. Checking the table:\n\n- i1's no built is 20.\n- i3's no built is 27.\n\nSince 27 - 20 = 7, the claim is true.

The claim is: \"there be 10 more i1 build than c3.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table columns to understand what each column represents. The table has headers: class, wheels, date, no built, and loco nos.\n\nThe relevant parts of the claim are about comparing the number of builds (no built) between i1 and c3, specifically whether i1 has 10 more builds than c3.\n\nSo I need to find the rows for i1 and c3 in the 'no built' column. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- For class i1: row index seems to be 2 (since classes go h1, c3, i1, etc.) Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the first row is h1, then c3, then i1 as third, so row_index for i1 would be 2.\nThe 'no built' value for i1 is 20.\n\nFor c3: it's the second row, so row_index 1. The 'no built' value is 10.\n\nSo now, calculate if i1 has 10 more than c3: 20 - 10 = 10. So yes, there are 10 more i1 builds than c3. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that the numbers are correct.

The difference is exactly 10. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells.

Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe phrase \"the lowest no built be class i4\" seems a bit confusing at first glance. Breaking it down: \"no built\" probably refers to the number of locomotives not built, as that's one of the columns in the table. So the claim is stating that the lowest number of locomotives not built corresponds to class i4.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several classes: h1, c3, i1, i2, i3, i4, j1, h2. Each row has a \"no built\" column. My task is to find out which class has the lowest \"no built\" value and check if it's indeed class i4.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the \"no built\" values for each class from the table:\n\n- h1: 5\n- c3: 10\n- i1: 20\n- i2: 10\n- i3: 27\n- i4: 5\n- j1: 1\n- h2: 6\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest value. Let's list them out:\n\nh1: 5  \nc3: 10  \ni1: 20  \ni2: 10  \ni3: 27  \ni4: 5  \nj1: 1  \nh2: 6  \n\nThe smallest number here is 1, which corresponds to class j1. The next lowest is 5, shared by classes h1 and i4.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the lowest no built be class i4.\" But according to my list, class j1 has a lower \"no built\" value of 1. So if the claim is stating that the lowest is class i4, that would be incorrect because j1 actually has the lowest.\n\nHowever, I should double-check in case I misread something. Let me verify each row:\n\n- For h1: no built is 5  \n- c3: 10  \n- i1:20  \n- i2:10  \n- i3:27  \n- i4:5  \n- j1:1  \n- h2:6  \n\nYes, j1 has the lowest with 1. So the claim that \"the lowest no built be class i4\" is FALSE because it's actually j1.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misinterpreted the term \"lowest.\" Could \"lowest no built\" refer to something else? No, in this context, it should mean the smallest number of locomotives not built. So yes, it's definitely j1 with 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that class i4 has the lowest \"no built\" value, but upon examining the table, class j1 has the lowest \"no built\" value of 1.

So, the claim is saying that the highest number of locomotives built (highest no built) belongs to class h2.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there's a column called \"no built\". For each row, which represents a different class, this column has numbers indicating how many locomotives were built for that class.

The claim says, \"the only class with wheel 0 - 6 - 0 be i1.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which row and column are relevant here. Let me look at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: class, wheels, date, no built, loco nos.\n\nThe claim is about a specific type of wheel configuration. So I need to focus on the 'wheels' column because that's where the 0 - 6 - 0 appears or not.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- h1 has wheels 4 - 4 - 2\n- c3 has wheels 0 - 6 - 0\n- i1 has wheels 4 - 4 - 2t\n- i2 has wheels 4 - 4 - 2t\n- i3 has wheels 4 - 4 - 2t\n- i4 has wheels 4 - 4 - 2t\n- j1 has wheels 4 - 6 - 2t\n- h2 has wheels 4 - 4 - 2\n\nSo only c3 has wheels 0 - 6 - 0. The claim says that the only class with this wheel is i1, but in reality, it's c3. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'wheels' column for row c3 (which is index 1) has the value 0 - 6 - 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because class c3 also has wheels 0 - 6 - 0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wheels\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 7 more i1 build than i3\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions two classes: i1 and i3. So, I'll focus on those rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the table headers:\n- class\n- wheels\n- date\n- no built\n- loco nos\n\nI need to find the \"no built\" column for both i1 and i3 because the claim is about the number of builds. \n\nNow, I'll locate the relevant rows:\n\n- For i1: The row has class \"i1\". Looking through the table:\n  - The second row is i2\n  - Third row is i1: | i1 | ... | no built | ...\n  So, in the third row, the \"no built\" value is 20.\n\n- For i3: Similarly, searching for the class \"i3\":\n  - The fifth row is i3: | i3 | ... | no built | ...\n  Here, \"no built\" is 27.\n\nNow, the claim states that there are 7 more i1 builds than i3. So, mathematically, this would mean:\n\ni1_no_built = i3_no_built + 7\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n20 (i1) should be equal to 27 (i3) + 7\nBut 27 + 7 is 34, which is not equal to 20. In fact, it's less.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because i3 has more builds than i1, not 7 more.\n\nTo confirm, I need to extract the relevant cells:\n- i1 row: row_index 2 (since rows start from 0), column \"no built\"\n- i3 row: row_index 4, same column.\n\nThese are the only cells needed to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because i3 has more builds than i1. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be 10 fewer i1 build than c3.\" So, this means that the number of i1 builds should be 10 less than the number of c3 builds. My task is to check if this statement holds true based on the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: class, wheels, date, no built, and loco nos. The relevant parts for the claim are likely the \"no built\" column for i1 and c3 classes because that's where the number of builds is indicated.\n\nI need to find the rows corresponding to i1 and c3 in the table.\n\n- For i1: Scanning through the table, I see a row labeled i1. The \"no built\" value here is 20.\n- For c3: Similarly, there's a row for c3 with a \"no built\" value of 10.\n\nNow, let's calculate if the number of i1 builds is indeed 10 fewer than c3 builds. \n\nc3 has 10 builds, so 10 + 10 = 20. That matches exactly the number of i1 builds (20). Therefore, it seems that there are 10 fewer i1 builds compared to c3 because 20 (i1) is equal to 10 (c3) plus 10.\n\nWait a second, actually, if c3 has 10 and i1 has 20, then i1 is not 10 fewer but rather 10 more. So the claim says \"there be 10 fewer i1 build than c3,\" which would mean i1 should be 10 less than c3. But since i1 is higher (20 vs 10), this makes the statement FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I'm interpreting the columns correctly. The column \"no built\" likely refers to the number of locomotives built for each class. So yes, c3 has 10 and i1 has 20. Therefore, i1 is actually 10 more than c3, not fewer.\n\nSo the claim that there are 10 fewer i1 builds than c3 is incorrect; it's the opposite. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
