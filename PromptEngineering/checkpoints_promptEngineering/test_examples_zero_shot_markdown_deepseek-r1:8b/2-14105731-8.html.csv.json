Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the format of season 6 being Q145. So my first step should be to look at the table and find out which season corresponds to season 6, then check its format value.\n\nLooking at the table columns: it has episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate. The \"season\" column goes from 1 to 16, I believe, based on the numbers listed. So I need to find all entries where the \"season\" is 6.\n\nLet me scan through each row's season number:\n\n- Episode 217: Season 1\n- Episode 218: Season 2\n- Episode 219: Season 3\n- Episode 220: Season 4\n- Episode 221: Season 5\n- Episode 222: Season 6\n\nAh, there we go. So the 6th season is episode 222. Now, I need to look at the format for season 6, which is Q145.\n\nThe claim says the format of season 6 is Q145, so that seems correct based on the table because in row 222 (Season 6), the format is indeed q145. So does this mean the claim is TRUE?\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other relevant cells or possible mistakes. Let me double-check:\n\n- Season: 6\n- Format: q145\n\nYes, that matches exactly what the claim states. There's no discrepancy in the data provided. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 222, \"column_name\": \"format\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about \"season 6.0.\" Looking at the table, the season column ranges from 1 to 16. So, season 6 would be when the season is listed as 6. But in the given table, the seasons go up to 16, so I should check if there's a season 6 in the table.\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row has an \"episode\" number and a \"season\" number. For example, episode 217 is season 1, episode 218 is season 2, and so on up to season 16 (episodes 231-232). So, there's no season 6 in this table because the highest is season 16, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbering.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"season\" column is just numbered from 1 to 10 or so, and each season has multiple episodes. Let me check the table again. The episodes go up to 232, and the seasons go up to 16, meaning that each season must have several episodes. So, maybe the claim refers to a specific season number.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"season 6.0.\" Hmm, perhaps it's referring to season 6.0, which is not an integer, so that might be a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe \"6.0\" means something else, like the sixth season.\n\nLooking back at the table, I need to see if any row has a season number of 6. Let me scan through each episode's season: 1,2,3,4,5,6... Wait, yes, looking at the first few rows, I see episode 222 is season 6 (q145). So, perhaps that's what the claim refers to.\n\nThe claim also says \"have q245 as its format.\" Looking at the table, each row has a \"format\" column. For example, some formats are h75, h76, q143, etc. The claim says it should be q245. I need to check if any season 6 has format q245.\n\nBut wait, looking through all the rows in the table, none of them have format q245. The highest I see is q150 for episode 230 and q148 for episode 228. So, q245 doesn't appear in the \"format\" column at all.\n\nTherefore, since season 6 exists (episode 222) but its format is q145, not q245, the claim that season 6.0 has q245 as its format is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that season 6.0 has a format of q245. However, in the table, season 6 corresponds to episode 222 with a format of q145. Since q245 isn't present for any relevant row, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 221, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"episode number\" refers to the 'episode' column in the table. So, for example, the row with episode 223 is what we're focusing on. The second part of the claim mentions \"q147 format,\" which relates to the 'format' column in the table.\n\nI'll start by locating the relevant rows and columns in the table that need to be checked against the claim. The claim specifically refers to episode number 223, so I should look at row 223. In the table, each row has several columns: episode, season, format, title, and original airdate.\n\nSince the claim is about the 'format' of a specific episode, I need to check what the format for episode 223 is. Looking at the 'format' column in the table, I see that it lists codes like h75, h76, etc. Each code corresponds to different formats used in the show.\n\nNow, I need to verify if any other episodes have a format of q147 besides episode 223. To do this, I'll scan through each row's 'format' column and note down which episode numbers correspond to q147.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Episode 225 has a format of q147.\n- Episode 223 also has a format of q147.\n\nWait, so both episode 223 and 225 have the same format code. That means there are multiple episodes with the q147 format. Therefore, the claim that \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format\" is not accurate because there's at least another episode (225) sharing the same format.\n\nI should also check if there are any other episodes beyond 225 and 223. Scanning through:\n\n- Episode 227: h80\n- Episode 228: q148\n- Episode 229: q149\n- Episode 230: q150\n- Episode 231: h81\n- Episode 232: h82\n\nNone of these have the format q147 except for 223 and 225. So, that confirms that there's more than one episode with the q147 format.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly states that only episode 223 has q147 format.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format,\" we examine the table:\n\n1. **Check for Episode 223**: The format is q146, not q147.\n2. **Identify Episodes with q147 Format**: Only Episode 225 has q147.\n\nSince multiple episodes have q147, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 223, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
