    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Viswanathan Anand is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"viswanathan anand have a rating greater than 2753 , with a prev less than 4 , and + 4 as the chng.\" So I need to check three things:\n\n1. His rating is greater than 2753.\n2. His previous rank (prev) is less than 4.\n3. The change in rating is +4.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: rank, prev, player, rating, and change. Each row represents a player's position in the rankings along with their previous rank, current rating, and the change from their previous rating.\n\nI should start by locating Viswanathan Anand in the table. From the table, I see that he is listed as \"viswanathan anand ( ind )\" in the first data row, which corresponds to row 1. Wait, actually, looking again, the headers are rank, prev, player, rating, and change. So the first row after the headers is rank 1, then rank 2, etc. Let me make sure of his position.\n\nWait, no, the table's first column under \"rank\" seems to be a sequential number starting from 1 to 10. The players are listed in order of their current rank. So Viswanathan Anand is in row 1, right? Because the first data row shows rank 1, player as viswanathan anand.\n\nSo for Viswanathan Anand:\n\n- Rank (row index) is 0 or 1? Wait, looking at the table, it's given in markdown. The first column after the headers is \"rank\" with values starting from 1, then 2, etc., up to 10. So each row has a unique rank.\n\nWait, but in the sample JSON, they used row_index as integers, presumably starting from 0 or 1? In the example given, the relevant cells were at indices 0 and 1. So probably, the rows are zero-indexed. Therefore, Viswanathan Anand is in row index 0.\n\nWait no, looking back: The first data row after headers is rank 1, which would correspond to row_index 0 if we start counting from 0. But sometimes, tables are counted starting at 1 for the rows. I need to clarify that.\n\nIn the problem statement's example, relevant_cells had row indices starting from 0. So I should assume that the first data row is row index 0, second row index 1, and so on up to row index 9 (since there are 10 rows of data).\n\nSo Viswanathan Anand is in row 0.\n\nNow, checking each condition:\n\n1. Rating greater than 2753: Looking at his rating column, it's 2803. Is 2803 > 2753? Yes, because 2803 minus 2753 is 50. So the first condition is true.\n\n2. Previous rank (prev) less than 4: The \"prev\" column for Viswanathan Anand in row 0 is 2. So prev = 2. Is 2 < 4? Yes, that's true as well.\n\n3. Change (+4): In the change column, it's +4. So this condition is also met.\n\nSo all three conditions are satisfied by Viswanathan Anand's data in row 0, columns: rating and prev and chng.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the table to make sure I'm not making a mistake with rows. The headers are:\n\n|   rank |   prev | player                        |   rating | change   |\n\nThen the first data row is:\n\n|      1 |      2 | viswanathan anand ( ind )     |     2803 | + 4      |\n\nSo rank 1, prev 2, player Anand, rating 2803, change +4.\n\nYes, so in the table, each row corresponds to a specific player's position, with their previous rank. So in the JSON output, the relevant cells would be the columns for this player: rating, prev, and change.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the rating column, which is 2803, so row index 0.\n- For the prev column, which is 2, so row index 0.\n- For the change column, which is +4, so row index 0.\n\nThus, all three conditions are met in row 0. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Viswanathan Anand's rating, previous rank, and rating change is fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prev\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"change\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
