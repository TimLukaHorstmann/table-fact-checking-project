    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"more than 100 game be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. They're talking about a series related to the sawhorse dollar trophy. So I need to find which row in the table corresponds to that trophy.\n\nLooking at the table, there's an entry for \"sawhorse dollar\" under the trophy column for Dartmouth - Princeton. Let me check: Yes, the fourth row has \"sawhorse dollar\" as the trophy, with teams Dartmouth and Princeton facing each other.\n\nNow, I need to look at the number of games played for that series. The table shows 90 games played for Dartmouth - Princeton's series with the sawhorse dollar trophy. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"more than 100 games be play.\" So is 90 more than 100? No, it's less. That means the statement isn't true.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I didn't miss any other rows. Let me go through each row again. Columbia - Cornell has 98 games, which is still less than 100. Princeton - Yale has 134, but that's a different trophy (none), so it doesn't count for the sawhorse dollar series. Similarly, Harvard - Yale and Cornell - Penn also don't have the sawhorse dollar trophy.\n\nSo only Dartmouth - Princeton's series has the sawhorse dollar trophy with 90 games played, which is less than 100. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that more than 100 games were played in the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy. Checking the table, the Dartmouth-Princeton series with this trophy played 90 games, which is not more than 100.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table: teams, name, trophy, first met, games played, series record. The claim mentions a trophy called \"sawhorse dollar,\" so I should find that row in the table.\n\nLooking through the 'trophy' column, I see:\n- empire state bowl\n- trustee 's cup\n- sawhorse dollar\n- none\n- none\n\nSo, the third row has \"sawhorse dollar\" as the trophy. That means the relevant row is row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed). Now, looking at the columns mentioned in the claim: \"game\" and \"series.\" Wait, but the exact wording is \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy.\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The claim might mean that 90 games were played in the series related to the sawhorse dollar trophy. So, I need to check the 'games played' column for that row.\n\nIn row index 2 (dartmouth - princeton), the trophy is \"sawhorse dollar\" and 'games played' is 90. That matches the claim's mention of 90 games. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are where the team is dartmouth - princeton, at row index 2, columns 'trophy' and 'games played'. But wait, the claim doesn't mention the team names but refers to the trophy directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any other rows have \"sawhorse dollar.\" Only one row has that, which is row 2. So yes, in that row, games played are 90.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the table shows that for the sawhorse dollar trophy, 90 games were played.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 90 games were played for the series associated with the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy. Checking the table, the third row (index 2) corresponds to this trophy and lists 90 games played.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
