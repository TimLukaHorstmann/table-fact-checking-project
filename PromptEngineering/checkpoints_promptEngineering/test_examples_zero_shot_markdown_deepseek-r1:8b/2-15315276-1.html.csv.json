    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"jessica shepley receive a winner's share of 14000 when she win the beaver meadow golf course tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key points:\n1. The champion is Jessica Shepley.\n2. She won the tournament.\n3. The winner's share is $14,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and provides information about various aspects of the tournament. My task is to check which cells are relevant to verify this claim.\n\nStarting with the champion's name: In 2011, under the \"champion\" column, it says \"jessica shepley.\" That matches point 1.\n\nNext, checking the tournament location: The table shows that most tournaments took place at \"beaver meadow golf course,\" but in 2004, it changed to \"canterbury woods country club.\" Since Jessica Shepley's win is in 2011, we can confirm she played at Beaver Meadow. This relates to point 3.\n\nNow, checking the winner's share: For each year, there's a \"winner's share\" column. In 2011, this column has \"14000,\" which matches point 3 exactly.\n\nPutting it all together, all three parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Jessica Shepley receiving a winner's share of $14,000 for winning at Beaver Meadow, we need to check relevant cells in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- 2011 row, \"champion\" column: Jessica Shepley\n- 2011 row, \"winner's share\" column: 14000\n\nThese confirm her victory and prize money as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 2012, the champion was from the United States.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to 2012 in the table. Scanning through the 'year' column, I see that 2012 is indeed one of the rows. Now, I need to find out who the champion was that year.\n\nLooking at the 'champion' column for 2012, it says \"jenny gleason.\" Next, I check the 'country' column for Jenny Gleason in 2012. The country listed is \"united states.\"\n\nSo, putting this together: In 2012, Jenny Gleason from the United States was the champion. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The row for 2012 is index 1 (since it's zero-indexed). The columns we need are 'year', 'champion', and 'country.' These three cells are essential to verify the claim. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those at row index 1 for the 'year,' 'champion,' and 'country' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Jenny Shin's winnings is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"champion jenny shin share 14000 dollar when she win.\" So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that supports this statement.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and provides information about various aspects of a tournament. The relevant columns here are \"champion,\" \"score,\" \"purse,\" \"winner's share,\" and maybe \"country\" if needed for her nationality but I don't think it's necessary here.\n\nStarting with 2013: Champion is PK Kongkraphan, so not Jenny Shin.\n\n2012: Champion is Jenny Gleason, different person. Not our target.\n\n2011: Champion is Jessica Shepley. Nope.\n\n2010: Champion is Jenny Shin. Okay, that's the one. Now I need to check her winnings for this year.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column for 2010, it says 205 (11). The \"purse\" is 110,000 and \"winner's share\" is 15,400. Wait, but the claim says she shared 14,000. Hmm, that doesn't match exactly. Or does it? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in 2010, her winner's share is listed as 15,400. The claim says 14,000, which is different. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nIs there another row where Jenny Shin was the champion with a 14,000 winner's share?\n\nLooking further:\n\n2009: Champion is Misun Cho, not Jenny Shin.\n\n2008: Mo Martin, nope.\n\n2007: Ji Min Jeong, no.\n\n2006: Charlotte Mayorkas, different name, probably a typo because earlier entries have Jenny Shin. Wait, in 2010 and 2004, the champion is listed as Jenny Shin? Wait, no, looking at 2004, the champion is Erica Blasberg, not Jenny Shin.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 2013: PK Kongkraphan\n- 2012: Jenny Gleason\n- 2011: Jessica Shepley\n- 2010: Jenny Shin\n- 2009: Misun Cho\n- 2008: Mo Martin\n- 2007: Ji Min Jeong\n- 2006: Charlotte Mayorkas (I think this might be a name typo, perhaps it's meant to be Jenny Shin? Or maybe different people)\n- 2005: Kyeong Bae\n- 2004: Erica Blasberg\n\nSo only in 2010 is Jenny Shin the champion.\n\nNow, checking her winnings for that year. The \"purse\" is 110,000 and \"winner's share\" is 15,400. So the claim says she won 14,000. That doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the row for 2010:\n\n- Year: 2010\n- Dates: jul 19 - 25\n- Champion: Jenny Shin\n- Country: United States\n- Score: 205 (11)\n- Tournament location: beaver meadow golf course\n- Purse: 110000\n- Winner's share: 15400\n\nSo her winner's share is indeed 15,400. The claim says 14,000, so that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in row numbering. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows are from 2013 (row 0) down to 2004 (row 8). So Jenny Shin is only in row 3 (2010). Her winner's share there is 15,400, not 14,000.\n\nIs there another instance where she won 14,000? Let me scan the table again. No other rows have Jenny Shin as champion except 2010. The closest is 2004, but that's Erica Blasberg and her purse is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the \"purse\" column. For example, in 2010, purse is 110000, winner's share 15400. So that doesn't match the claim of 14,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"score\" column refers to points or something else, but the \"winner's share\" seems to be separate. So if the claim says she won 14,000, but according to the table, she only got 15,400 in 2010 and no other entries with her as champion.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jenny Shin won $14,000 when she won. Checking the table, Jenny Shin was the champion in 2010. Her winner's share was $15,400, which does not match the claim of $14,000. No other rows list her as champion with a $14,000 share.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner 's share of less than 15400.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. \"Purse\": This refers to the total prize money in the tournament.\n2. \"Winner's share\": This is the amount that the winner receives from the purse.\n3. The claim is saying that after 2012, there are zero purses where the winner's share is less than 15,400.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it goes from 2004 to 2013, so I need to check from 2013 down to 2012 because it says \"after 2012.\" Wait, actually, if it's after 2012, does that mean starting from 2013? Because 2012 is the cutoff.\n\nSo, focusing on the years 2013 and 2012.\n\nFor 2013:\n- Year: 2013\n- Winner's share: 15,000 (from the table)\n- Purse: 100,000\n\nWait, so in 2013, the winner got 15k. That's equal to 15,400? No, it's less because 15k is 15,000 which is less than 15,400. So that would be a case where the purse (which is 100k) has a winner's share less than 15,400.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"zero purses after 2012\" with a winner's share less than 15,400. Wait, no. Actually, I think the claim is slightly ambiguous. Let me parse it again: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner 's share of less than 15400.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's misread. Maybe the claim is saying that there are zero purses (i.e., tournaments) after 2012 where the winner's share is less than 15,400.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- For 2013: Winner's share is 15k, which is less than 15,400.\n- For 2012: Winner's share is 15k as well (from the table).\n\nWait no, in the table, for 2012, it says \"jenny gleason\" from the US with a score of 211(5) and purse 100,000, winner's share 15,000. So yes, both 2012 and 2013 have winner's shares less than 15,400.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the claim is saying there are zero such purses after 2012. But in reality, both 2012 and 2013 would count, which means there are two purses (tournaments) after 2012 where the winner's share was less than 15,400.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"after 2012.\" If it includes 2012, then yes, 2012 is included. But if \"after 2012\" means starting from 2013 onwards, then only 2013 and beyond. Wait, but the table goes up to 2013, so maybe 2013 is the only one after 2012.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The claim says \"after 2012,\" which could mean years following 2012, i.e., 2013 and onwards. So in that case, looking at 2013: winner's share 15k <15,400, so that's one purse. Therefore, the claim is saying there are zero such purses after 2012, but in reality, there is at least one (2013). Thus, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"after 2012\" includes 2012 itself, then both 2012 and 2013 would count, making it even more false.\n\nSo, in either case, the claim is incorrect because there are purses after 2012 where the winner's share was less than 15,400.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: we need to look for the purse and winner's share columns for years after 2012. So that would be:\n\n- For 2013: column \"winner 's share\" is 15000\n- For 2012: same, 15000\n\nSo the relevant_cells are row indices 3 (2013) and 4 (2012), checking the \"winner 's share\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are zero purses after 2012 with a winner's share less than 15,400. However, examining the table, both 2012 and 2013 have winner's shares of 15,000, which is below the threshold. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about various golf tournaments from 2004 to 2013. The claim I need to verify is: \"after 2012 the winner's share was never less than 15000.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that starting from 2012 onwards, each subsequent year (2013 and beyond), the winner's share has been at least 15,000. But looking at the table, it only goes up to 2013. So I guess I'll have to check the years 2012, 2013, and maybe see if there are any later years beyond the table that might affect this, but since the table ends in 2013, I can't reference data beyond that.\n\nWait, no, actually, the table goes from 2004 to 2013. So the claim says \"after 2012,\" meaning starting from 2013 onwards. But in our table, the latest year is 2013, so we need to check if all years after 2012 (which is just 2013) meet the condition.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure: After 2012 means 2013 and beyond, but since our data only goes up to 2013, that's the only year to consider besides 2012. Wait no, the claim says \"after 2012,\" so starting from 2013 onwards. But in our table, we have both 2012 and 2013.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify: The claim is about years after 2012, so starting with 2013. So I need to check all entries for the winner's share in 2013 and beyond, but since the table only goes up to 2013, that's just 2013. However, looking at the table, let me see.\n\nLooking at the column called \"winner's share,\" each row has this value. Let me list them out with their years:\n\n- 2013: 15,000\n- 2012: 15,000\n- 2011: 14,000\n- 2010: 15,400\n- 2009: 12,600\n- 2008: 11,200\n- 2007: 10,500\n- 2006: 9,800\n- 2005: 9,100\n- 2004: 9,100\n\nWait a minute. The claim is about the winner's share after 2012 being never less than 15,000. So starting from 2013 onwards. But in our table, we have only one year after 2012, which is 2013. Let me check that.\n\nIn 2013, the winner's share is 15,000. That meets the condition of being at least 15,000. However, I should also consider whether there are any years before 2012 that might affect this claim, but no, the claim specifies \"after 2012,\" so it's about the subsequent years.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says after 2012, meaning starting from 2013. So in our table, we have both 2012 and 2013. Let me see: In 2012, the winner's share was 15,000; that's okay because it's exactly 15k. In 2013, it's also 15k. But wait, what about the years after 2012? Since our table doesn't have data beyond 2013, we can't confirm anything for those years. So does that mean the claim is based only on the data available in the table?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying within the given table data, starting from 2012 onwards (so 2012 and 2013), the winner's share was never less than 15k. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the claim says \"after 2012,\" which would be 2013 and beyond. But since our table only goes up to 2013, we have to check if from 2013 onwards (which is just one year), the winner's share was not less than 15k. In that case, yes, it's 15k.\n\nBut wait, in 2012, the winner's share was also 15k. So does \"after 2012\" include 2012? No, after 2012 would be starting from 2013. So the only relevant year is 2013, which is 15k. Therefore, it meets the condition.\n\nBut wait another thought: The claim says \"the winner's share was never less than 15000.\" But looking back at the table, in 2011, the winner's share was 14,000, which is less than 15k. However, since that's before 2012, it doesn't affect the claim about after 2012.\n\nSo, focusing on the years after 2012 (2013), only one year is available, and the winner's share was 15k. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the table data provided. But wait, actually, let me make sure I'm interpreting \"after 2012\" correctly.\n\nIf \"after 2012\" means starting from 2013 onwards, then only 2013 is relevant. So in that case, yes, it's 15k. However, if \"after 2012\" includes 2012 as the starting point, then we also need to check 2012 and beyond. In that case, both 2012 (15k) and 2013 (15k) meet the condition.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's stated as \"after 2012,\" which typically would mean from 2013 onwards. So only 2013 needs to be checked. Since the table shows 15k for that year, the claim is true based on the data provided.\n\nHowever, another point: The table includes years before and after 2012. But the claim's condition is about the winner's share never being less than 15000 after 2012. So we need to check all entries where the year is after 2012 (i.e., 2013 and beyond), but our table only has up to 2013. In that case, it's satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that based on the data provided in the table, from 2013 onwards (which is just 2013 in this case) the winner's share was never less than 15000, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, the claim holds true as the winner's share for the year 2013 and beyond (within the available data) meets or exceeds 15,000.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true.",
