    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about the Philadelphia Flyers' record being 40-11-10 as of February 23rd is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns: game, february, opponent, score, and record. Each row corresponds to a specific game, with details filled in.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the philadelphia flyer record be 40 - 11 - 10 as of february 23rd.\" So, I'm looking for the Philadelphia Flyers' record on February 23rd being 40-11-10.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a game number and a specific date in February. For example, row 61 has the game number 61, opponent Philadelphia Flyers, score 4-3, and record 40-11-10, with the february value as 23. So, that seems to match the claim exactly.\n\nI need to verify if there's any relevant cell that supports this claim. The key points are the opponent (Philadelphia Flyers), the february date (23rd), and the record (40-11-10). All these columns are present in row 61.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be where each of these pieces of information is found: game 61, february being 23, opponent being Philadelphia Flyers, score 4-3, and record 40-11-10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
