    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Rob Emerson having a highest win record of 13-10 in his MMA career is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"rob emerson have the highest win record of 13 - 10 in his mma career.\" The key points here are that Rob Emerson has a win record of 13-10 and it's the highest. So, I need to check if there's any row in the table where 'res' is 'win', the record is 13-10, and whether this is the highest such record.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an event with columns like 'res' (result), 'record' (the actual score), 'opponent', etc. The first step is to find any rows where the res column is 'win' and the record matches 13-10.\n\nScanning through the 'res' column: I see entries like 'win', 'loss', 'nc'. So, focusing on 'win' rows.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First row: res is win, record is 13-10 (1). Opponent is jared downing, event bellator 104, round 1.\n2. Second row: res win, record 12-10(1), opponent savant young, etc.\n3. Third row: loss, so skip.\n4. Fourth row: win, 11-9(1). Not 13-10.\n5. Fifth row: win, 10-9(1). Not 13-10.\n6. Sixth row: loss.\n7. Seventh row: win, 9-8(1).\n8. Eighth row: loss.\n9. Ninth row: win, 8-6(1).\n10. Tenth row: win, 7-6(1).\n11. Eleventh row: nc (no contest). Not a win.\n12. Twelfth row: win, 6-6 vs kenji arai.\n13. Thirteenth row: win, 5-6 vs takafumi ito.\n14. Fourteenth row: win, 4-6 vs jamie schmidt.\n15. Fifteenth row: win, 3-6 vs julian samaniego.\n16. Sixteenth row: loss.\n17. Seventeenth row: loss.\n18. Eighteenth row: win, 2-4 vs joe camacho.\n19. Nineteenth row: win, 1-4 vs justin berkley.\n20. Twentieth row: loss.\n21. Twenty-first row: loss.\n22. Twenty-second row: loss.\n\nSo, only the first row has a 'win' and a record of 13-10(1). Now, does this mean that Rob Emerson has the highest win record at 13-10? We need to check if there are any other wins with higher or equal records.\n\nLooking through all the 'record' columns for 'res' as 'win', the maximum number seems to be 13-10 in the first row. There are no other 'win's with 13-10, and the next highest win record is 12-10(1) in the second row. So, Rob Emerson does have a 13-10 win record, but is this the highest?\n\nWait, actually, looking again: The records for wins are:\n\n- 13-10\n- 12-10\n- 11-9\n- 10-9\n- 9-8\n- 8-6\n- 7-6\n- 6-6\n- 5-6\n- 4-6\n- 3-6\n- 2-4\n- 1-4\n\nSo, the highest win record is indeed 13-10. Therefore, Rob Emerson's 13-10 win record is the highest among his wins. Thus, the claim seems to be correct.\n\nBut wait, could there be another fighter with a higher win record? The table includes multiple fighters, but I'm only looking at Rob Emerson here. Since he has a 13-10 record and it's the highest in the 'res' column for wins, his record stands as the highest.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says, \"there be only 1 ko (punches) method for win by rob emerson.\" \n\nFirst, I should look into the table provided. The columns include res, record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. My focus is on the 'method' column because the claim mentions a specific method type\u2014KO (punches). Also, the claim specifies \"win by rob emerson,\" so I need to find any rows where Rob Emerson has a win via KO.\n\nLooking through the table, I notice that each row has a 'res' entry like 'win,' 'loss,' etc. Next, I should check if there's an opponent named Rob Emerson in any of these records. If found, then I look at the method used for their victory.\n\nSkimming down the opponents list: jared downing, savant young, justin salas, eric reynolds, rodney rhoden, nik lentz, phillipe nover, rafael dos anjos, kurt pellegrino, manny gamburyan, keita nakamura, gray maynard, kenji arai, takafumi ito, jamie schmidt, julian samaniego, melvin guillard, randy velarde, joe camacho, justin berkley, doenokjonosuke mishima, javier vazquez, jamal perkins, jens pulver. I don't see Rob Emerson here.\n\nWait a second\u2014if Rob Emerson isn't listed as an opponent in any of these records, then there can be no wins by him via KO punches because he hasn't fought anyone in this table. Therefore, the claim that there's only one such method is actually false because there are zero instances of Rob Emerson winning via KO punches.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because Rob Emerson isn't even present in any of these fights.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are no records of Rob Emerson winning by KO (punches) in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a match against Eric Reynolds is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"match against eric reynolds be 1 of the 4 match to have decision (split) method.\" So, I need to check if Eric Reynolds has four matches where the method was a split decision.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a fight event. The columns include 'res' (result), 'record', 'opponent', 'method', 'event', 'round', and 'location'. My focus is on the 'opponent' column because Eric Reynolds should be involved in some of these matches.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find all instances where Eric Reynolds was an opponent.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent is Jared Downing. Not Eric Reynolds.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is Savant Young. Not Eric Reynolds.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is Justin Salas. Not Eric Reynolds.\n4. **Row 3**: Opponent is Eric Reynolds. Here, the result is a 'win' with a split decision method. So that's one match where the method was split.\n5. **Row 4**: Opponent is Rodney Rhoden. Not Eric Reynolds.\n6. **Row 5**: Opponent is Nik Lentz. Not Eric Reynolds.\n7. **Row 6**: Opponent is Phillipe Nover. Not Eric Reynolds.\n8. **Row 7**: Opponent is Rafael dos Anjos. Not Eric Reynolds.\n9. **Row 8**: Opponent is Kurt Pellegrino. Not Eric Reynolds.\n10. **Row 9**: Opponent is Manny Gamburyan. Not Eric Reynolds.\n11. **Row 10**: Opponent is Keita Nakamura. Not Eric Reynolds.\n12. **Row 11**: Opponent is Gray Maynard. Not Eric Reynolds.\n13. **Row 12**: Opponent is Kenji Arai. Not Eric Reynolds.\n14. **Row 13**: Opponent is Takafumi Ito. Not Eric Reynolds.\n15. **Row 14**: Opponent is Jamie Schmidt. Not Eric Reynolds.\n16. **Row 15**: Opponent is Julian Samaniego. Not Eric Reynolds.\n17. **Row 16**: Opponent is Melvin Guillard. Not Eric Reynolds.\n18. **Row 17**: Opponent is Randy Velarde. Not Eric Reynolds.\n19. **Row 18**: Opponent is Joe Camacho. Not Eric Reynolds.\n20. **Row 19**: Opponent is Justin Berkley. Not Eric Reynolds.\n21. **Row 20**: Opponent is Dokonjonosuke Mishima. Not Eric Reynolds.\n22. **Row 21**: Opponent is Javier Vazquez. Not Eric Reynolds.\n23. **Row 22**: Opponent is Jamal Perkins. Not Eric Reynolds.\n24. **Row 23**: Opponent is Jens Pulver. Not Eric Reynolds.\n\nFrom this, I see that only Row 3 has Eric Reynolds as the opponent with a split decision method. Now, the claim says \"1 of the 4 matches to have decision (split) method.\" So, does Eric Reynolds have four such matches? \n\nLooking again, in Row 3, Eric Reynolds is the opponent, and he lost with a split decision. Are there any other rows where Eric Reynolds was the opponent and the result was a split decision?\n\nWait, I might have missed something. The table lists the 'res' column as 'win', 'loss', etc., but for each row, it's either a win or loss for whom? Is the 'opponent' always the one being fought against, so if the result is a win, then Eric Reynolds won against that opponent.\n\nBut in Row 3, the res is 'win' with a split method. So that means Eric Reynolds had a split decision victory. Are there any other rows where Eric Reynolds was the opponent and he had a split decision?\n\nLooking back through all rows again:\n\n- Only Row 3 has Eric Reynolds as opponent with a split decision.\n\nSo, in total, only one match where Eric Reynolds had a split decision. The claim says \"1 of the 4 matches,\" which would mean four such instances. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's only one match, not four, where Eric Reynolds had a split decision method.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Perhaps the claim refers to matches in general, regardless of who the opponent was. Let me check if any other opponents had split decisions and whether Eric Reynolds was involved as an opponent in four such matches.\n\nBut no, the claim specifically mentions \"match against eric reynolds,\" so it's about Eric Reynolds having four split decision matches, not that four matches overall have split decisions where he might be involved or not.\n\nTherefore, since there's only one match where Eric Reynolds was the opponent and the method was a split decision, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that Eric Reynolds has only one match with a split decision. The claim states there are four such matches, so it's false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is asking.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to see if there's any record of Rob Emerson fighting in UFC 87. The table lists various events with columns like res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. \n\nI should scan through each row to check for an event named \"UFC 87\". Let me go row by row:\n\n1. Bellator 104 - nope.\n2. TPF 12: Second Coming - nope.\n3. Full Force Fighting - nope.\n4. Art of Fighting 10 - nope.\n5. Pure Combat 12 - nope.\n6. UFC Fight Night: Florian vs Gomi - nope.\n7. UFC 109 - nope.\n8. UFC 103 - nope.\n9. UFC Fight Night: Lauzon vs Stephens - nope.\n10. UFC 87 - Yes! Here it is in row 10.\n\nLooking at row index 10, the event is \"UFC 87\". The result for that fight is a win against Keita Nakamura by decision (split). So Rob Emerson did participate in UFC 87. \n\nWait, but the claim says he never played at UFC 87. But according to the table, he did play there. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE because there's evidence in the table that he was part of that event.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant rows, but since only one row matches the event name, I think that's sufficient. So the answer is FALSE because Rob Emerson did participate in UFC 87.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Rob Emerson participated in the UFC 87 event, we examine the table for an entry where the event is \"UFC 87\". \n\n- **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n  - Review each row of the table to find any mention of \"UFC 87\".\n  - Locate row index 10, which lists the event as \"UFC 87\" and the result as a win against Keita Nakamura.\n  \n**Conclusion:** Rob Emerson did participate in UFC 87, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The 'res' column indicates whether it was a win, loss, or no contest. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"rob emerson,\" but in the table, I don't see any fighter named Rob Emerson.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they meant someone else, but according to the data given, we don't have any fights for Rob Emerson.\n\nSo, since there are no losses by Rob Emerson in this table, the total number of losses would be zero, not ten.

The res column says 'win' for those rows where someone won. But without knowing the opponents in those cases, it's hard to attribute the win to a specific fighter unless his name is listed as the opponent.\n\nSince none of the opponents match Rob Emerson, I can't find any relevant data about his record here.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds be the only match to have decision method.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. Rob Emerson fought against Eric Reynolds.\n2. This particular match was the only one where the method used was a decision.\n3. So, I need to check if all other matches in the table don't have a decision method.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. \n\nI should first locate Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds. To do this, I'll scan through the 'opponent' column for \"Eric Reynolds.\" From the table, I see that in row 4, the opponent is Eric Reynolds. The res here is a win with a split decision (method: decision (split)). \n\nSo, that's one match where it was a decision. Now, I need to check if any other matches in the table also used the decision method.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row and note down which fights resulted in a decision. The 'method' column will tell me this. Let's list them out:\n\n- Row 0: win via submission (heel hook)\n- Row1: win via rear naked choke\n- Row2: loss via unanimous decision\n- Row3: win via split decision\n- Row4: win via punches (TKO)\n- Row5: loss via unanimous decision\n- Row6: win via split decision\n- Row7: loss via unanimous decision\n- Row8: loss via submission (rear naked choke)\n- Row9: win via KO\n- Row10: draw (no contest, double KO)\n- Row11: Eric Reynolds vs Kenji Arai? Wait, no. Looking back, row 4 is Eric Reynolds as opponent, so row 11 might not be related.\nWait, no, row 11 says res is 6-6 with opponent Kenji Arai, method is decision (unanimous). So that's another decision method.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Row12: win via split decision\n- Row13: win via split decision? Wait, looking at the data, in row4 it's Eric Reynolds as the opponent, and row3 is a win by Eric Reynolds. So maybe I'm confusing rows.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all rows where method is 'decision.'\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow2: loss, method=unanimous decision (so that counts)\nRow3: split decision\nRow5: loss, unanimous\nRow6: split\nRow7: loss, unanimous\nRow10: no contest (double KO)\nRow11: Kenji Arai vs someone else? Wait, row 11 is res=6-6, opponent=Kenji Arai. So that's a different fight.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all rows with 'decision' in method:\n\n- Row2: loss, method=unanimous\n- Row3: win, split decision\n- Row5: loss, unanimous\n- Row7: loss, unanimous\n- Row11: res=6-6, method=unanimous. So that's another decision.\nWait, row10 is no contest, not a decision. So rows 2,3,5,7,11 have 'decision' as the method.\n\nSo, Rob Emerson vs Eric Reynolds (row4) was one of them, but there are others:\n\n- Row2: someone else\n- Row3: Eric Reynolds winning against someone\n- Row5: someone else's loss via decision\n- Row7: another fight, someone lost via decision\n- Row11: different fighters.\n\nSo that means there are multiple matches with the decision method. Therefore, Rob Emerson vs Eric Reynolds is not the only one.\n\nThus, the claim is false because other fights also used the decision method.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows multiple instances where the result was a decision, including but not limited to Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds. Since there are other matches with the same method, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"rob emerson play at the ufc 87 event 3 time in his career.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"Rob Emerson\" playing at UFC 87, specifically event 3 in his career. So I need to look through the table for any fights involving Rob Emerson where the event is UFC 87 and it was his third fight.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, location. The key columns here are \"event\" and \"round\". But wait, the \"round\" column shows the specific round number in which the fighter participated, not necessarily that it's their third fight overall.\n\nWait, actually, the table lists each event with a \"record\" which is something like 10 - 9 (1), but I think that might represent the fighter's record at that point. But without more context, it's unclear if the number in parentheses refers to something else. Maybe the numbers after the hyphen are the fighter's record before the fight, and (1) could indicate a specific event or round.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87 as his third event. So I need to find any row where the opponent is Rob Emerson, the event is \"ufc 87\", and it's his third fight. Alternatively, since the table doesn't list the fighter's name directly but lists opponents like jared downing, savant young, etc., maybe the first column \"res\" includes whether it was a win or loss, but not necessarily the fighter's name.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again, each row seems to represent a fight where the res is either win, loss, or nc. The opponent is who they fought against, and the event is what event it was. So for example, in the first row, \"rob emerson\" isn't listed as an opponent, so maybe Rob Emerson is a fighter that hasn't been mentioned here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again. The opponents listed are jared downing, savant young, justin salas, eric reynolds, rodney rhoden, nik lentz, phillipe nover, rafael dos anjos, kurt pellegrino, manny gamburyan, keita nakamura, gray maynard, kenji arai, takafumi ito, jamie schmidt, julian samaniego, melvin guillard, randy velarde, joe camacho, justin berkley, dokonjonosuke mishima, javier vazquez, jamal perkins, jens pulver.\n\nNowhere in the opponents column do I see \"Rob Emerson.\" That makes me think that Rob Emerson might not be listed here, so perhaps he wasn't part of these events. Alternatively, maybe Rob Emerson is an opponent in one of these fights but isn't listed in the table as an opponent, which would mean the table doesn't include all events.\n\nWait, no, the table seems to list opponents, so if Rob Emerson fought, his name should be here somewhere. Since it's not, perhaps he didn't fight in any of these events, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"event 3 time in his career\" refers to the third event he participated in, which would correspond to the third row in the table. So looking for Rob Emerson's first three events. But since his name isn't listed as an opponent, maybe he didn't fight in any of these events.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Rob Emerson play at the ufc 87 event 3 time in his career.\" So specifically, he fought at UFC 87, and it was his third fight. If I can't find Rob Emerson in the opponents list, then perhaps he didn't fight there, making the claim FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rob Emerson is a fighter who did fight three times, including once at UFC 87. But without seeing his name in the table, it's hard to confirm. Maybe the table doesn't include all events or fighters, but I think the assumption is that the table includes all relevant information for this claim.\n\nWait, perhaps \"event\" refers to a specific event number, and if Rob Emerson fought at UFC 87 as his third fight, then we need to find any row where the opponent is Rob Emerson, the event is UFC 87, and it's the third time he's fighting. But again, since his name isn't in the opponents column, perhaps he didn't fight there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the table works. Maybe each fighter has their own set of events listed here, but only opponents are shown. So if Rob Emerson fought someone, that opponent is listed, and the event would be marked as his fight.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, for example, in row 0: res win, record 10-9(1), opponent jared downing, method something. Maybe that's a fighter's first fight? Or perhaps each fight is noted with their own progress.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"record\" refers to their winning streak or something else. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, another approach: The claim says Rob Emerson played at UFC 87 as his third event. So we need to see if there's a row where the fighter (opponent) is someone else, and the opponent's res shows that they lost to him at UFC 87 as his third fight. But without knowing who he fought, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rob Emerson is not in this table because he wasn't part of these events, making the claim false. Or maybe he was part of one, but since his name isn't listed, we can't confirm.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the \"event\" column refers to the event number, and if Rob Emerson fought at event 3 (which is UFC 87), then that's relevant. So looking for any row where the opponent is someone, the event is UFC 87, and it's his third fight. But without knowing which fighters have their third fight at UFC 87, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only lists events up to a certain point, and Rob Emerson fought in one of them as his third fight. Since I can't find his name in the opponents list, maybe he didn't, so the claim is false.\n\nI think the key here is that Rob Emerson's name isn't listed as an opponent in any of these fights. Therefore, there's no evidence in the table to support that he fought at UFC 87 or at all in this context. So the claim would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"rob emerson have only win 10 match in his career\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Rob Emerson has won exactly 10 matches in his entire career. So, I should look through the table to find any records involving Rob Emerson and check how many wins he has.\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column, I see names like jared downing, savant young, justin salas, eric reynolds, rodney rhoden, nik lentz, phillipe nover, rafael dos anjos, kurt pellegrino, manny gamburyan, keita nakamura, gray maynard, kenji arai, takafumi ito, jamie schmidt, julian samaniego, melvin guillard, randy velarde, joe camacho, justin berkley, doenokjonosuke mishima, javier vazquez, jamal perkins, jens pulver.\n\nNone of these names seem to be Rob Emerson. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe Rob Emerson is another name or a different spelling. Alternatively, maybe the table doesn't list all his fights.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'res' column indicates the result: win, loss, or nc (no contest). For each row, if res is 'win', that counts as a win for the fighter on that row. So I should check each row where the opponent might be Rob Emerson, but since none of the opponents are named Rob Emerson, maybe the claim refers to someone else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete or doesn't list all of his fights. If Rob Emerson has only 10 wins in total, and the table shows some of his wins, I need to count how many 'win' results he has here.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Win against jared downing\n2. Win against savant young\n3. Loss\n4. Win against eric reynolds\n5. Win against rodney rhoden\n6. Loss\n7. Win against nik lentz\n8. Win against phillipe nover\n9. Loss\n10. Loss\n11. Win against kurt pellegrino\n12. Win against manny gamburyan\n13. Win against keita nakamura\n14. No contest\n15. Win against kenji arai\n16. Win against takafumi ito\n17. Win against jamie schmidt\n18. Win against julian samaniego\n19. Loss\n20. Win against melvin guillard\n21. Loss\n22. Win against randy velarde\n23. Win against joe camacho\n24. Win against justin berkley\n25. Loss\n26. Loss\n27. Loss\n\nCounting the 'win' results: rows 1,2,4,5,7,8,11,12,13,14 (wait, row 14 is a no contest, not a win), so excluding that, I get rows 1,2,4,5,7,8,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,23. Wait, but this is for the opponents listed in the table, which don't include Rob Emerson.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table. Each row represents a fight, with the fighter on one side and the opponent on the other. So if the fighter's name is Rob Emerson, then each 'win' would count towards his total wins. But since none of the opponents match Rob Emerson, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table only lists certain fighters, and Rob Emerson isn't listed here, meaning he might have more than 10 wins elsewhere. Or perhaps Rob Emerson is one of these opponents, but that doesn't make sense because the claim is about his wins.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe claim is that Rob Emerson has only won 10 matches in his career. So I need to check if, according to the table provided, he has exactly 10 wins. The table lists multiple opponents and their results, but unless Rob Emerson is one of these opponents with 10 wins, the claim isn't supported.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- If Rob Emerson is the fighter in a 'win' row, that's a win for him.\n- If he's the opponent in a 'win' row, it doesn't count towards his total.\n\nSo I need to check if Rob Emerson is listed as a fighter with 10 wins. Alternatively, perhaps the table includes all of his fights, and he has exactly 10 wins.\n\nWait, but looking through the opponents, none are named Rob Emerson. So maybe the claim is incorrect because there's no evidence in the table that he has only 10 wins. Or perhaps Rob Emerson isn't listed here, meaning his total could be higher than 10, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rob Emerson is one of the fighters with multiple wins in the table, but I can't tell from the opponents list. Since none of the opponents match Rob Emerson's name, it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the 'fighter' side isn't listed, so each row has two fighters: one who won and one who lost. So if Rob Emerson is a fighter with 10 wins in total, we need to see if any row lists him as the winner 10 times.\n\nBut without knowing which rows correspond to Rob Emerson's fights, it's impossible to tell from this table alone. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the provided data because there's no direct evidence of how many wins Rob Emerson has in total based on this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified using the provided table as Rob Emerson's name does not appear among the opponents listed. Without knowing which rows correspond to his fights, it's impossible to determine if he has exactly 10 wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
