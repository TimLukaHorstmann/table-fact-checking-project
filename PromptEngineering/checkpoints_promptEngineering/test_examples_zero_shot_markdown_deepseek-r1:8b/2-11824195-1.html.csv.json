    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the game against the miami dolphin have 34063 in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions a game against the Miami Dolphins with an attendance of 34063. So, I need to find in the table any row where the opponent is the Miami Dolphins and the attendance number matches 34063.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different game for that week. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Week 1: Opponent is Buffalo Bills, attendance 42023 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n2. Week 2: Opponent is Oakland Raiders, attendance 50746 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n3. Week 3: Opponent is Boston Patriots, attendance 22641 \u2013 No.\n4. Week 4: Opponent is Buffalo Bills again, attendance 43885 \u2013 Not Miami Dolphins.\n5. Week 5: Opponent is Denver Broncos, attendance 33929 \u2013 Close number but wrong opponent.\n6. Week 6: Opponent is Oakland Raiders, attendance 33057 \u2013 No.\n7. Week 7: Opponent is Denver Broncos, attendance 26196 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n8. Week 8: Opponent is Houston Oilers, attendance 31676 \u2013 Not relevant.\n9. Week 9: Opponent is San Diego Chargers, attendance 40986 \u2013 No.\n10. Week 10: Opponent is Miami Dolphins, attendance 34063 \u2013 This matches the claim.\n11. Week 11: Opponent is Boston Patriots, attendance 41475 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n12. Week 12: Opponent is New York Jets, attendance 60318 \u2013 No.\n13. Week 14: Opponent is Miami Dolphins again, attendance 17881 \u2013 Number doesn't match.\n14. Week 15: Opponent is San Diego Chargers, attendance 28348 \u2013 Doesn't fit.\n\nFrom this analysis, I see that the game against the Miami Dolphins with the specified attendance is in week 10. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"33057 crowd attend the week 6 game\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions a crowd of 33057 attending a week 6 game. So, my goal is to find out if there's a row in the table that matches both the attendance number and the week number specified.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. I'll focus on the \"week\" column and the \"attendance\" column to see if any row matches these values.\n\nStarting with the \"week 6\". Scanning through the weeks, week 6 is indeed present in the table. The corresponding row for week 6 has an opponent of oakland raiders and a result of l 34 - 13. The attendance for that game is listed as 33057. That's exactly the number mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, checking each part:\n- Week 6 exists in the table.\n- Attendance for week 6 is 33057.\nBoth conditions are satisfied, which means the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "claim": "6 week 's game be attend by 33007 crowd",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"6 week's game be attend by 33007 crowd.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find the relevant information for each part of the claim.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. It refers to the \"6 week\" game.\n2. It mentions that this game was attended by a crowd of 33,007 people.\n\nStarting with the first part: identifying which week is referred to as \"6 weeks.\" Looking at the table, each row represents a different week. The rows go from week 1 up to week 15, but I notice that week 13 is missing. So, week 12 is labeled as November 27, 1966, and week 14 is December 11, 1966. Therefore, week 13 isn't present in the table. \n\nWait, no\u2014let me check again. The table starts at week 1 and goes up to week 15, but I see that after week 12 comes week 14, so week 13 is skipped. That means there's no data for week 13. So, if the claim refers to week 6, which should be October 16, 1966, opposing team Oakland Raiders, result l 34 - 13, attendance 33057.\n\nNow, looking at the second part: attendance of 33,007. In the table, for week 6, the attendance is 33,057. That's close but not exactly 33,007. Hmm, so maybe I need to see if any other week matches this number. Let me check each week:\n\n- Week 1: 42,023\n- Week 2: 50,746\n- Week 3: 22,641\n- Week 4: 43,885\n- Week 5: 33,929\n- Week 6: 33,057\n- Week 7: 26,196\n- Week 8: 31,676\n- Week 9: 40,986\n- Week 10: 34,063\n- Week 11: 41,475\n- Week 12: 60,318\n- Week 14: 17,881\n- Week 15: 28,348\n\nNone of these attendances equal 33,007. The closest is week 6 at 33,057 and week 5 at 33,929. So the exact number isn't present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"6 week's game,\" which might mean the game that occurred in week 6. If so, then we check week 6's attendance. But it's 33,057, not 33,007. Therefore, the attendance figure doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the claim is referring to a different week. Since week 13 is missing, maybe the user intended that, but since there's no data for week 13, I can't verify any attendance for it. So even if we consider week 6 as \"6 weeks game,\" the attendance doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because the attendance figure provided (33,007) doesn't exactly match any of the attendances listed in the table for any week.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a specific \"6 week's game\" was attended by 33,007 people. However:\n\n1. The term \"6 week's game\" is ambiguous but likely refers to week 6. In week 6, the attendance was 33,057.\n2. The claimed attendance of 33,007 doesn't match any recorded figure in the table.\n\nThus, the claim isn't supported by the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
