    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim about the game against the Buffalo Sabres having an attendance of 10,750 is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find all games where the opponent is the Buffalo Sabres. Scanning down, I see row number 47: it's January 21 and the opponent is Buffalo Sabres. \n\nNow, I need to check the attendance for that specific game. The \"attendance\" column for row 47 shows 15,611. Hmm, that's much higher than 10,750.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. No, the claim says 10,750, but the actual attendance was 15,611. So the claim isn't correct.\n\nI also check other rows to see if there's another game against Buffalo Sabres with a lower attendance, but row 47 is the only one listed as Buffalo Sabres and its attendance is higher than 10k. Therefore, the claim is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against the Buffalo Sabres had an attendance of 10,750. However, looking at the table, the only game against the Buffalo Sabres (row 47) had an attendance of 15,611. Since this doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
