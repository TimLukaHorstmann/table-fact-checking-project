    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"edgerrin james be the number 4 pick in the first round and number 4 overall.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The first part mentions edgerrin james being the number 4 pick in the first round. In the table, I should check if there's a row where the \"pick\" is 4 and the name is edgerrin james.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: pick is 4, name is edgerrin james.\n- So yes, he was picked 4th in round 1. That part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim says he's number 4 overall. I need to look at the \"overall\" column and see if his overall number is 4. In row 0, the overall is 4, which matches.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
