    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the Cruz Azul team is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that Cruz Azul has about a 0.842 points less than Guadalajara. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate where both teams are in the table. Looking at the 'team' column:\n\n- Cruz Azul is team number 4.\n- Guadalajara is team number 3.\n\nNow, I need to find their total points and see the difference. From the table:\n\n- Cruz Azul's total pts: 25\n- Guadalajara's total pts: 31\n\nCalculating the difference: 31 - 25 = 6 points.\n\nThe claim mentions about 0.842 points less, but in reality, it's a difference of 6 points. 0.842 is much smaller than 6, so that doesn't match up. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate based on the data provided.\n\nI should identify which cells are relevant. For both teams, I need their 'total pts' and maybe 'avg' for verification, but since the main figure is the total points, those two rows will be relevant.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Cruz Azul's points compared to Guadalajara is true, we'll check the relevant cells in the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Teams in Table:**\n   - Cruz Azul is team number 4.\n   - Guadalajara is team number 3.\n\n2. **Extract Total Points:**\n   - Cruz Azul: 25 points.\n   - Guadalajara: 31 points.\n\n3. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - 31 (Guadalajara) - 25 (Cruz Azul) = 6 points difference.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states a difference of about 0.842 points, which is not the case here; it's actually 6 points.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nThe relevant cells are those that provide the total points for both teams to calculate the actual difference.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read the claim again: \"'toluca 's 10c pt be just as much as monterrey 's 09 pt.\" Hmm, wait, that might have a typo or misformatting, but I think it's saying that Toluca's 10C points are equal to Monterrey's 9A points. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the positions.\n\nLooking at the table structure: columns are team names, and then various game stats like 07a pts, 08c pts, etc. Each row is a team, with their points in each category. The claim mentions '10c pt' for Toluca and '09 pt' for Monterrey. I need to figure out what that refers to.\n\nIn the table, each team has entries like 07a pts, 08c pts, etc. For Toluca, the row is pos=1 with columns like 07 a pts (34), 08 c pts (27), and so on. So '10c pt' would be under the column named \"10 c pts\" for Toluca.\n\nMonterrey's row is at pos=6, looking at their points in each category. The claim says Monterrey's 09 pt, which I think refers to the 09 a pts or maybe 09 c pts? Wait, let me check the columns again.\n\nLooking back: columns include \"07 a pts\", \"08 c pts\", etc., so the numbering is like year (probably) followed by 'a' for away points or 'c' for home. So \"10 c pts\" would be their home game points in 10th round, and \"09 pt\" likely refers to either 09 a pts or 09 c pts.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"09 pt\", which might be a shorthand. Let me check Monterrey's data. For Monterrey (pos=6), looking at the columns:\n\n07a pts:14, 08c pts:24, 08a pts:19, 09c pts:26, 09a pts:30, etc.\n\nSo if the claim is comparing \"10c pt\" for Toluca and \"09 pt\" for Monterrey, I need to figure out which column that corresponds to.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"09 pt\" refers to their points in 09 c pts or 09 a pts. So, let me look at both Toluca's 10c pts and Monterrey's corresponding points.\n\nLooking up Toluca: pos=1, their 10c pts are 30 as per row index 0 (since rows start from 1 but in the table it's pos=1). Wait no, in the table, the first column is \"pos\" which starts at 1, so the first data row is team toluca, and the columns are:\n\n07a pts:34\n\n08c pts:27\n\n08a pts:27\n\n09c pts:36\n\n09a pts:35\n\n10c pts:30\n\nSo Toluca's \"10 c pts\" is 30.\n\nMonterrey's row (pos=6): their data includes:\n\nLooking for \"09 pt\". Wait, the columns are specific like 07a, 08c, etc. So if it's \"09 a pts\", that would be 30. Or perhaps \"09 c pts\" is 26. But the claim says \"09 pt,\" which might be a shorthand for total points in that round or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the claim more carefully. The claim is: 'toluca 's 10c pt be just as much as monterrey 's 09 pt.\n\nSo Toluca's 10c pt is equal to Monterrey's 9pt.\n\nBut what does \"09 pt\" refer to? It could be either 09a pts or 09c pts. Let me see the values:\n\nFor Monterrey, pos=6:\n\n07a pts:14\n\n08c pts:24\n\n08a pts:19\n\n09c pts:26\n\n09a pts:30\n\nSo if \"09 pt\" is referring to total points for that round, it might be 09a + 09c? Or maybe the column name. Wait, perhaps \"09 pt\" refers to a specific statistic, but in the table, each game type (like away or home) has separate columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in shorthand and meant to refer to \"09 a pts\". So for Monterrey, 09a pts are 30.\n\nSo Toluca's 10c pts:30 vs. Monterrey's 09a pts:30.\n\nIf that's the case, then yes, they are equal. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check:\n\nToluca's row (pos=1):\n\n- 07a pts:34\n\n- 08c pts:27\n\n- 08a pts:27\n\n- 09c pts:36\n\n- 09a pts:35\n\n- 10c pts:30\n\nMonterrey's row (pos=6):\n\n- 07a pts:14\n\n- 08c pts:24\n\n- 08a pts:19\n\n- 09c pts:26\n\n- 09a pts:30\n\n- 10c pts: I don't see it, but the columns go up to 10c pts for some teams? Wait, no. The columns listed are 07a pts, 08c pts, 08a pts, 09c pts, 09a pts, 10c pts, and then perhaps others?\n\nWait, looking at the table, each team has data in those specific columns. So Toluca's 10c pts is 30.\n\nMonterrey's 09a pts are 30. So if the claim is comparing 10c pts of Toluca (30) to 09a pts of Monterrey (30), then yes, they are equal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with relevant cells being:\n\nToluca: pos=1, column \"10 c pts\"\n\nMonterrey: pos=6, column \"09 a pts\"\n\nWait, but the columns in the table are named as per the headers. So for Toluca, it's \"10c pts\" and for Monterrey, it's \"09a pts\".\n\nSo I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"10 c pts\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"09 a pts\"}]}",

Puebla is listed as row 12, and Chiapas is row 14. Now, I need to find their \"08 c pts\".\n\nLooking at the column headers, \"08 c pts\" is one of them. For Puebla (row 12), the \"08 c pts\" is 21. For Chiapas (row 14), it's 26.\n\nSo, subtracting Puebla's points from Chiapas's: 26 - 21 = 5. The claim says about 3 less, but it's actually a difference of 5. That seems off. So the claim isn't accurate because there's a larger discrepancy than stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Puebla scores about 3 fewer points than Chiapas in \"08 c pts.\" Checking the table, Puebla has 21 points and Chiapas has 26, which is a difference of 5.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the quera taro team have about 10 time less point than the america team.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which teams we're talking about here. The claim mentions both Quera Taro and America. Looking at the table, I see that there's a row for Quera Taro and one for America. Let me find their positions in the table.\n\nQuera Taro is listed as position 16, and the America team isn't directly mentioned. Wait, looking back, there's an \"america\" team at position 10, right? So I think the claim is comparing Quera Taro to America.\n\nNow, I need to check the points each team has. The key columns for points are \"07 a pts,\" \"08 c pts,\" and so on, but maybe it's more efficient to look at the \"total pts\" column since the claim refers to total points.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Quera Taro (row 16) has a total of 39 points.\n- America (row 10) has a total of 136 points.\n\nThe claim says Quera Taro has about 10 times less points than America. So, is 39 approximately 10 times less than 136?\n\nLet me do the math: 136 divided by 10 is 13.6. But Quera Taro only has 39 points, which is much less than that. Wait, but maybe I should calculate how many times less 39 is compared to 136.\n\nTo find out how many times less 39 is than 136, I can divide 136 by 39. Let's see: 136 \u00f7 39 \u2248 3.48. So Quera Taro has about 1/3.48 times the points of America, which means they have roughly 2.8 times fewer points, not 10 times less.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because it's stating a much larger difference than what the data shows.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the cruz azul and toluca team be about 3 - tenths point apart on average.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate where Cruz Azul and Toluca are in the table. Looking at the 'team' column:\n\n- Cruz Azul is row 4.\n- Toluca is row 1.\n\nSo, I need to look at their average points. The avg column has two relevant cells here: row 4 for Cruz Azul and row 1 for Toluca.\n\nLet me get their averages:\n\n- Cruz Azul: 1.5\n- Toluca: 1.8529\n\nNow, calculate the difference between these two averages. That's 1.8529 minus 1.5, which equals 0.3529. \n\nThe claim mentions \"about 3 - tenths point apart.\" Since 0.35 is roughly 0.35, which is less than 0.4 but more than 0.3, it might be considered about 3 tenths (0.3) if we round or approximate. However, the exact difference is 0.3529, which is closer to 0.35 than 0.36. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"about 3 - tenths,\" which I think means 0.30 or 0.35. If it's about 0.3, then 0.35 is slightly higher. However, in terms of significant figures, maybe it's acceptable to say they are approximately 3 tenths apart.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact difference needs to be within a certain range for it to be considered \"about 3 tenths.\" If the difference is more than 0.35, then it wouldn't fit into the 0.3-0.4 range as 3 tenths apart. Since it's exactly 0.3529, which is just over 0.35, maybe it doesn't quite qualify.\n\nWait, but in the table, let me double-check the averages:\n\nCruz Azul: row 4, avg is 1.5\n\nToluca: row 1, avg is 1.8529\n\nDifference is indeed 1.8529 - 1.5 = 0.3529 points apart.\n\nSo, it's approximately 0.35 points apart. If the claim refers to \"about 3 tenths,\" which is 0.30 or so, then technically 0.35 is closer to 0.35 than 0.30, but maybe depending on how rounding is done, it could be considered as about 3 tenths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average difference over multiple games or something else is intended, but in this table, it's a single season's average.\n\nSo, the exact difference is approximately 0.35 points apart, which is slightly more than 0.3 (which would be exactly 3 tenths). Therefore, whether the claim is true depends on if \"about 3 tenths\" includes 0.35 or not. If it's about 0.3 to 0.4, then yes; otherwise, no.\n\nBut looking at how averages are typically compared, a difference of approximately 0.35 would be considered around 3.5 tenths, which is more than 3 tenths but less than 4. So if the claim says \"about 3 tenths,\" it's slightly off because it's closer to 0.35 than 0.30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a specific match or some rounded figure. However, based strictly on the table provided, the average points are 1.5 for Cruz Azul and 1.8529 for Toluca, which is about 0.35 apart.\n\nI think the key here is whether 0.35 is considered \"about 3 tenths\" or not. Since 3 tenths is 0.30, and it's more than that but less than 4 tenths (0.40), perhaps it's still within the range of being about 3 tenths when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nBut in reality, 0.35 is closer to 0.35 than 0.30, so maybe it's not exactly \"about 3 tenths\" but more precisely around 3.5 tenths. So if the claim is specifically stating 3 tenths, it might be slightly inaccurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"about\" is intended to mean approximately, so any difference close to that number would suffice. In that case, 0.35 is about 0.30, especially considering that averages can have decimal precision issues.\n\nBut I think more accurately, the difference is 0.3529, which is approximately 0.35 or 3.5 tenths. Therefore, if the claim says \"about 3 tenths,\" it's technically a bit off because 3.5 is closer to 4 than 3 in terms of whole numbers.\n\nWait, but tenths are decimal places, so 0.30 is 3 tenths, 0.35 is 3.5 tenths. The claim says \"about 3 - tenths,\" which might imply 0.30 or 0.35 as an approximate. So it's about 3 tenths apart.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to say approximately a third of a point, but that's not exactly what is written.\n\nIn any case, based on the exact figures from the table, the difference between their averages is 0.3529, which is approximately 0.35 or 3.5 tenths. So if the claim says \"about 3 tenths,\" it's slightly inaccurate because 0.35 is closer to 0.4 than 0.3 when rounding to one decimal place.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer should be that the difference is approximately 0.35 points, which is not exactly about 3 tenths but close to 3.5 tenths. So the claim's statement isn't entirely accurate as it stands.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The user might just want the exact cells from the table that pertain to both teams.\n\nSo, to answer their initial question about which cells are relevant: for Cruz Azul, row 4; Toluca, row 1; and the column is 'avg' or 'average.'\n\nBut in the problem statement, they provided an example with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" So I need to specify both teams and their respective rows.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Cruz Azul: row 4, avg column\n- Toluca: row 1, avg column\n\nTherefore, in the JSON response, these two cells are highlighted.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that the average points for Cruz Azul and Toluca are approximately 0.35 points apart, which is about 3 tenths when rounded to one decimal place. While technically closer to 0.35 than 0.30, it can be considered \"about 3 tenths\" depending on rounding conventions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Teams in the Table:**\n   - Cruz Azul is found at row index 4.\n   - Toluca is found at row index 1.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - Both teams' averages are listed under the \"avg\" column.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Points Difference:**\n   - Cruz Azul's average: 1.5\n   - Toluca's average: 1.8529\n   - Difference: 0.3529 points, which is approximately 0.35 or 3.5 tenths.\n\n4. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The exact difference (0.3529) is slightly more than 0.30 but less than 0.40.\n   - Depending on rounding, it can be considered \"about 3 tenths\" as an approximate value.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"avg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"monterrey's '09 a' pt be more than toluca's '10 c' pt.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of this statement means. The term '09 a' refers to the '09 season, in the 'Away' category for Monterrey. Similarly, '10 c' is the '10 season, 'Center Forward' or 'Centro delantero' for Toluca.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the relevant cells for both Monterrey and Toluca that correspond to these categories. \n\nFor Monterrey, I'm looking for their '09 a pts'. Scanning through the rows, Monterrey is listed as row 6 (since it's the 6th team). The columns are pos, team, 07 a pts, 08 c pts, 08 a pts, 09 c pts, 09 a pts, etc. So, for '09 a pts', that would be column 7 for Monterrey.\n\nFor Toluca, I need their '10 c pts'. Toluca is row 1 in the table. The columns are similar; '10 c pts' would be the last data point before total pts, so that's column 8 for Toluca? Wait, let me check: the columns after 'avg' are total pts and total pld. So, wait, looking at the headers again:\n\nColumns in order:\n- pos\n- team\n- 07 a pts (column 3)\n- 08 c pts (4)\n- 08 a pts (5)\n- 09 c pts (6)\n- 09 a pts (7)\n- 10 c pts (8)\n- total pts (9)\n- total pld (10)\n- avg (11)\n\nSo, for '10 c pts' of Toluca, it's column 8. Looking at row 1 for Toluca, under the columns:\n\nRow 1: pos=1, team=Toluca\n07 a pts=34\n08 c pts=27\n08 a pts=27\n09 c pts=36\n09 a pts=35\n10 c pts=30\n\nSo, Toluca's '10 c pts' is 30.\n\nMonterrey's '09 a pts' is in column 7. For row 6 (Monterrey), the columns are:\n\n07 a pts=14\n08 c pts=24\n08 a pts=19\n09 c pts=26\n09 a pts=30\n10 c pts=36\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me check again: the row for Monterrey is row 6.\n\nColumns:\npos=6 (team=Monterrey)\n07 a pts=14\n08 c pts=24\n08 a pts=19\n09 c pts=26\n09 a pts=30\n10 c pts=36\n\nSo, Monterrey's '09 a pts' is 30. Toluca's '10 c pts' is 30 as well.\n\nWait, so both have 30? So Monterrey's '09 a pts is equal to Toluca's '10 c pts'. The claim says that Monterrey's '09 a pts are more than Toluca's '10 c pts. But since they're equal, the statement would be FALSE because it's not greater.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in reading the columns. Let me double-check.\n\nMonterrey is row 6: team=Monterrey\nLooking for '09 a pts' which is column 7. So yes, 30.\n\nToluca is row 1:\n'10 c pts' is column 8, which is 30.\n\nSo both are equal at 30 points. Therefore, the claim that Monterrey's '09 a pts are more than Toluca's '10 c pts is false because they're equal.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for Monterrey and Toluca in the table show that their respective points are equal (both 30). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"09 a pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"10 c pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the chiapas team scores fewer points than the puebla team in the 08 c pt categorization.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. Let's start by understanding the categories involved here.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: Chiapas and Puebla. It also refers to the \"08 c pts\" category. Looking at the table, I see that it's structured with several columns, including \"team,\" various points categories (like 07 a pts, 08 c pts, etc.), total points, total games played, and average.\n\nSo, for this claim, I need to find the specific points for Chiapas and Puebla in the \"08 c pts\" column. Once I have those two numbers, I can compare them to see if Chiapas indeed has fewer points than Puebla in that category.\n\nStarting with Chiapas, I'll look through the table row by row until I find the team named Chiapas. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Team is Toluca\n2. Row 2: Santos Laguna\n3. Row 3: Guadalajara\n4. Row 4: Cruz Azul\n5. Row 5: Pachuca\n6. Row 6: Monterrey\n7. Row 7: Morelia\n8. Row 8: UNAM\n9. Row 9: San Luis\n10. Row 10: Am\u00e9rica\n11. Row 11: Atlante\n12. Row 12: Puebla\n13. Row 13: Estudiantes Tecos\n14. Row 14: Chiapas\n\nOkay, so Chiapas is in row 14.\n\nNow, for the \"08 c pts\" column. Let's look at the columns:\n\n- The relevant column is labeled \"08 c pts.\" So I need to find that value for both teams.\n\nLooking at row 14 (Chiapas), under \"08 c pts,\" it says 18.\n\nNext, looking for Puebla. Puebla is in row 12. Under \"08 c pts,\" the number is 21.\n\nSo Chiapas has 18 points in the 08 c pts category, and Puebla has 21 points.\n\nThe claim states that Chiapas scores fewer points than Puebla in this category. Since 18 is indeed less than 21, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"TRUE,\" with the relevant cells being row 14 for Chiapas and row 12 for Puebla, specifically looking at their \"08 c pts\" values.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"08 c pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"08 c pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim that \"the toluca team and the cruz azul team tie with the same average\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate where the Toluca and Cruz Azul teams are in the table. Looking at the 'team' column, Toluca is in position 1, and Cruz Azul is position 4.\n\nNow, to find their average points per game (avg), I should look at the 'avg' column for each of these teams. \n\nFor Toluca, which is row 1, their avg is listed as 1.8529. For Cruz Azul in row 4, it's 1.5.\n\nComparing these two averages: 1.8529 vs. 1.5. They are different numbers. Therefore, the claim that they tie with the same average isn't correct because their avg points per game aren't equal.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether the Toluca and Cruz Azul teams have the same average, I need to compare their 'avg' column values.\n\n- **Toluca (row 1)**: Avg = 1.8529\n- **Cruz Azul (row 4)**: Avg = 1.5\n\nSince these two averages are not equal, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Identify the rows for Toluca and Cruz Azul in the 'team' column.\n2. Extract their respective 'avg' values from those rows.\n3. Compare the two averages; since they differ, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the america team score fewer points than the quera taro team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which teams we're talking about. The claim mentions two teams: America and Quer\u00e9taro. So, I should look for their respective rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a team. Scanning through the 'team' column:\n\n- America is listed as row 10.\n- Quer\u00e9taro is listed as row 16.\n\nNext, I need to find the points each of these teams scored. The relevant columns for points seem to be \"07 a pts\", \"08 c pts\", and so on, but actually, looking closer, there's a column named \"total pts\" which should represent the total points accumulated by each team.\n\nFor America (row 10), the \"total pts\" is 136.\n\nFor Quer\u00e9taro (row 16), the \"total pts\" is 39.\n\nNow, comparing these two: America has 136 total points, and Quer\u00e9taro has 39. Since 136 is greater than 39, the claim states that America scores fewer points than Quer\u00e9taro, which would be incorrect.\n\nWait a second, I need to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim says \"America scores fewer points than Quer\u00e9taro,\" but according to the numbers, it's the opposite. So the claim is false because America actually has more points.\n\nAdditionally, I should identify which cells are relevant for this verification. The \"total pts\" and possibly each individual column, but likely only the total points matter here since that's the aggregate score. But to be thorough, all columns might be checked, but in reality, the claim is about the total points, so maybe just the \"total pts\" column is needed.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are for America (row 10) and Quer\u00e9taro (row 16), specifically looking at their \"total pts\". Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 10, column_name: total_pts\n- row_index: 16, column_name: total_pts\n\nPutting it all together, since America's total points are higher than Quer\u00e9taro's, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total pts\"}, {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total pts\"}]}",
