    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the upside down remix be the longest version of the song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-reference it with the information in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions the \"upside down remix.\" Looking at the table, under the remixes section, I see several entries like \"aches remix,\" \"pain killer mix,\" and \"upside down remix.\" Each of these seems to be a different remix version of the song. The column names include \"version\" and \"length,\" so I should focus on those.\n\nNext, the claim says that this remix is the longest version. So I need to find out which version has the longest duration. Looking at the table:\n\n- album version: 3:53\n- single version: 3:50\n- instrumental: 3:50\n- aches remix: 3:58\n- pain killer mix: 6:20\n- upside down remix: 6:45\n- music video: 4:00 (but that's the music video, not the song version)\n- live version: audio is 4:35, but that's for a live performance.\n\nSo comparing the lengths of the remixes:\n\n- aches remix: 3:58\n- pain killer mix: 6:20\n- upside down remix: 6:45\n\nOut of these, the upside down remix has the longest duration at 6 minutes and 45 seconds. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because the upside down remix is indeed the longest version among the listed remixes.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other versions that might be longer. The live version's audio is only 4:35, which is shorter than all the remixes except the single and instrumental versions. The album and single versions are even shorter at around 3 minutes each. So no, the upside down remix is still the longest.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"upside down remix\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"length\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify which cells in the table support that claim. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim again: \"there be 4 songs that have been remixed.\" So, I need to check how many entries in the 'remixed by' column indicate that a song has been remixed.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different version of a song or related content. The relevant columns for this claim are \"version\" and \"remixed by\". Specifically, we're focusing on the \"remixed by\" column because it tells us who did the remixing, which is key to determining whether a song was remixed.\n\nNow, let's go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **album version**: The 'remixed by' cell is empty (-). So, this isn't a remixed song.\n2. **single version**: Empty again, so no remix here.\n3. **instrumental**: Remixed by laurent boutonnat. That's one remix.\n4. **aches remix**: Here, the 'remixed by' mentions both laurent boutonnat and bertrand chtenet. So, this is definitely a remixed song. That's two so far.\n5. **pain killer mix**: Again, both laurent and bertrand are listed. That's three.\n6. **upside down remix**: Same as above, another remix. Now four.\n7. **music video**: No remix info here, so it doesn't count.\n8. **live version (recorded in 1996)**: Empty, so no.\n\nSo, the rows that contribute to remixed songs are rows 3, 4, 5, and 6. That's four instances where the 'remixed by' column is not empty, indicating a remix was done. \n\nTherefore, the claim stating there are four songs that have been remixed is TRUE, supported by these four rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the live version be the only version to have audio and \u00e0 video with different length.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a confusing statement, but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that among all the versions listed in the table, the live version is unique because its audio and video have different lengths. So, I should check each row corresponding to the live version to see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let's identify the rows related to the live version. Scanning through the \"version\" column: album version, single version, instrumental, aches remix, pain killer mix, upside down remix, music video, and live version. So, the live version is the last row in the table.\n\nNow, focusing on this live version row, I see that it has two length specifications: 4:35 (audio) and 4:18 (video). The claim says both audio and video lengths are different, which they indeed are. But wait, does this hold for any other versions? Let me check the other rows to ensure no other version also has differing audio and video lengths.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Album version: length is 3:53, but there's no mention of a separate audio or video length.\n- Single version: 3:50, same here.\n- Instrumental: 3:50; again, only one length specified.\n- Aches remix: 3:58, same as above.\n- Pain killer mix: 6:20.\n- Upside down remix: 6:45.\n- Music video: 4:00. Wait, this row has a different audio and video length? Let me check. The description says \"music videos ii , music videos ii & iii\" for the album column, but under length, it's just 4:00. Hmm, that might be a bit ambiguous. Is 4:00 referring to both audio and video combined or separately?\n\nWait, in the live version row, the lengths are split into (audio) and (video). So maybe in the music video row, perhaps the same applies? Or is it just one length? Let me see the original table again.\n\nIn the \"music video\" row, the \"length\" column says 4:00. The album column has \"music videos ii , music videos ii & iii.\" So, it's a bit unclear whether this is referring to both audio and video together or separately. Since in the live version, they're separated into audio and video, maybe the music video row also has separate lengths but it's not specified here.\n\nBut since the claim specifically mentions \"the live version be the only version,\" I think we don't need to consider other rows unless there's an indication that their lengths are different. If other rows only have a single length value without specifying audio and video separately, then maybe they don't have differing lengths as per the claim.\n\nSo, focusing back on the live version: it has 4:35 (audio) and 4:18 (video), which are indeed different. Now, is this the only version where both audio and video lengths are different?\n\nLooking at all other rows:\n\n- All versions except the live version have either a single length or no distinction between audio and video. For example, the instrumental version has a single length of 3:50 without separating audio and video.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the live version is indeed the only one where both audio and video lengths are specified and they differ from each other.\n\nWait, but in the music video row, if the length is 4:00, could that mean that both audio and video together sum up to 4:00? Or is it just a single track? If it's the latter, then there's no differentiation between audio and video, which would make the claim hold true as only the live version has differing lengths.\n\nAlternatively, if in the music video row, the audio is 4:00 and the video is also 4:00, that wouldn't be different. But since it's not specified, I think it's safer to assume that only the live version explicitly shows different audio and video lengths.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the claim appears to be TRUE because the live version is the sole entry where both audio and video lengths are listed and they differ. All other versions either have a single length or no distinction between audio and video.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"live version (recorded in 1996)\"}]}\n\nThe relevant cell is the live version row where both audio and video lengths are specified and differ.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the album version be the only 1 release in 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: It says that the album version was the only release in 1995. So, I need to find out what releases occurred in 1995 according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"version\" and a \"year\". The rows are:\n- album version (1995)\n- single version (1996)\n- instrumental (1996)\n- aches remix (1996)\n- pain killer mix (1996)\n- upside down remix (1996)\n- music video (1996)\n- live version (recorded in 1996)\n\nFrom this, I can see that the album version is listed under 1995. The other versions are all from 1996. So, there's only one release in 1995, which is the album version.\n\nNow, checking if it's the \"only\" release: Yes, because no other entries have a year of 1995. All others are in 1996 except for the live version, which also mentions 1996 as the year but notes that it was recorded in 1996.\n\nSo, the claim is correct based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as per the table data, where only one release (album version) occurred in 1995.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"over 2 years, there be 8 versions of the same song.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: version, length, album, remixed by, and year.\n\nThe claim mentions that over two years, there are eight versions of a song. So, my task is to check if in the table, within a two-year period, there are eight different versions listed.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different version with details like length, album, remixer, and year. The 'version' column lists names like 'album version,' 'single version,' etc., which suggests these are different remixes or versions of the same song.\n\nNext, I need to identify which years fall within \"over two years.\" Since the claim says \"over 2 years,\" it likely means more than two years, but considering the data starts in 1995 and ends in 1996, perhaps it's referring to the period from 1995 through 1996, which is two years.\n\nNow, I'll count how many entries are there. The table has eight rows, each representing a different version:\n\n1. album version - 1995\n2. single version - 1996\n3. instrumental - 1996\n4. aches remix - 1996\n5. pain killer mix - 1996\n6. upside down remix - 1996\n7. music video - 1996\n8. live version (recorded in 1996) - 1996\n\nWait, but some of these entries might be from the same year or different years. The claim says \"over two years,\" so I need to check if all eight versions are within a span of more than two years. However, the table shows that most of them are from 1996 except for the album version in 1995.\n\nIf we consider 1995 as part of the two-year period (since it's one year before 1996), then the time frame is from 1995 to 1996, which is exactly two years. But the claim says \"over two years,\" so maybe it's more than two years? That would mean starting in 1995 and ending in 1997, but there are no entries beyond 1996 in this table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"over two years\" is a bit flexible, and as long as the versions span more than two consecutive years, even if some are at the end. However, considering that most of the eight versions are from 1996, except for one from 1995, the time frame covered is from 1995 to 1996, which is exactly two years.\n\nBut wait, the album version is in 1995 and the other seven are in 1996. So over a span of two years (1995-1996), there are eight versions. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate based on the table provided.\n\nHowever, I should double-check whether all these entries are indeed different versions of the same song. The 'album version' and 'single version' could be different edits, the instrumental is a different interpretation, the remixes like aches and pain killer mixes are likely different from each other, the upside down remix is another variation, the music video might be an audio version or tied to visuals, and the live version is recorded in 1996.\n\nTherefore, all eight versions listed seem to refer to different takes or remixes of the same song over two years. The claim states \"over 2 year,\" so it's a bit ambiguous whether it's more than two years or at least two years. If we take it as \"at least two years,\" then since they span from 1995 to 1996, which is exactly two years, the claim holds.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be all rows where 'year' is either 1995 or 1996 because those are within the two-year period. Therefore, each row represents a version from that year, contributing to the total count of eight versions over those two years.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows eight different versions of a song across two consecutive years (1995 and 1996). Each row corresponds to a distinct version listed under \"version,\" with \"year\" indicating the release period. These versions are:\n\n1. album version - 1995\n2. single version - 1996\n3. instrumental - 1996\n4. aches remix - 1996\n5. pain killer mix - 1996\n6. upside down remix - 1996\n7. music video - 1996\n8. live version (recorded in 1996) - 1996\n\nAll eight versions are within the period from 1995 to 1996, which is a span of two years. Thus, the claim that there are eight versions over this period is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the upside down remix be the shortest version of the song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that the \"upside down remix\" is the shortest version of the song. To verify this, I need to check how long each version listed in the table is, especially focusing on the upside down remix and comparing it with other versions.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several versions listed under different columns like album version, single version, instrumental, aches remix, pain killer mix, etc., along with their respective lengths. The relevant column here would be \"length\" since we're dealing with time durations.\n\nI need to find the row for the upside down remix and then compare it with other versions that might be shorter or longer. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Album version: 3:53\n- Single version: 3:50\n- Instrumental: 3:50\n- Aches remix: 3:58\n- Pain killer mix: 6:20\n- Upside down remix: 6:45\n- Music video: 4:00\n- Live version: 4:35 (audio) and 4:18 (video)\n\nWait, the \"live version\" is split into audio and video, but I think for this claim, we're focusing on audio versions. So the live version's audio is 4:35.\n\nNow, comparing all these lengths:\n\n- The shortest versions are the album at 3:53 and both single and instrumental at 3:50.\n- Then comes the aches remix at 3:58.\n- After that, the pain killer mix at 6:20.\n- Next is the upside down remix at 6:45.\n- The music video is at 4:00.\n- Finally, the live version audio is the longest at 4:35.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me list them numerically:\n\n3:50 (single), 3:50 (instrumental), 3:53 (album), 3:58 (aches remix), 4:00 (music video), 4:35 (live audio), 6:20 (pain killer mix), 6:45 (upside down).\n\nSo the shortest is the single version at 3:50, followed by instrumental and album.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about this table is true or false. The claim says, \"the ache remix be the only version to have audio and \u00e0 video with different length.\" Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row in the table and check which ones mention both audio and video versions with different lengths. From the table, there are several versions listed: album version, single version, instrumental, aches remix, pain killer mix, upside down remix, music video, and live version. Each of these has columns for length, album, remixed by, and year.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"ache remix.\" So I should focus on that row first. According to the table, the aches remix has a length of 3:58, with no information provided for the album, since it's just \"-\". The remixed by column lists Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Chtenet. The year is 1996.\n\nLooking at the lengths, I notice that the aches remix has a time of 3:58. Now, I need to check if there's a corresponding video version with a different length. From the table, I don't see a separate row for the \"ache remix video\" or anything like that. The only video-related entry is the music video, which has a length of 4:00 and references \"music videos ii , music videos ii & iii\" in the album column.\n\nWait, so the aches remix's audio is 3:58, but there's no separate video listed for it. Instead, the music video is a different entry with its own length of 4:00. So does that mean the aches remix has an associated video? Or are they separate?\n\nI think each version's row refers to either audio or video. For example, the live version has both audio and video lengths. But for the aches remix, it only lists an audio length. There's no corresponding row for its video version.\n\nSo if I consider that \"ache remix\" might have a different audio and video length, but according to the table, there is no separate video entry for it. The music video is a separate row with its own length. Therefore, the claim that the aches remix has both audio and video with different lengths isn't fully supported because the table doesn't list a video version specifically for the aches remix.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the \"ache remix\" only refers to an audio version, while the music video is a separate entity. So in that case, they have different lengths but are different entries, not part of the same version. Therefore, the claim's wording might be incorrect because it says \"the ache remix be the only version,\" implying that its own audio and video have different lengths within the same row or as a pair.\n\nLooking back at the table, the live version has both audio and video lengths listed. So maybe that's another example where the audio and video have different lengths (4:35 vs 4:18). But the claim is about the ache remix being the only one to do so.\n\nWait, but does the aches remix have any associated video? From the table, I don't see a separate row for \"ache remix\" video. The music video is its own entry, and the live version has both audio and video lengths. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's not the ache remix that has a different audio and video length in its own row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is implying that within the same version, audio and video have different lengths, like the live version does. But the ache remix doesn't have such an entry. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"the ache remix be the only version to have audio and \u00e0 video with different length.\" Upon examining the table, the aches remix's audio has a length of 3:58, but there is no corresponding separate video version listed for it. Instead, the live version is the one that has both audio and video lengths. Therefore, the claim is false because the ache remix doesn't have an associated video with different length in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"live version (recorded in 1996)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"aches remix\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be 5 songs that have been remixed\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that there are five songs which have been remixed. So, I should look in the table for any indication of remixes and then count how many songs have that information.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: version, length, album, remixed by, and year. The \"remixed by\" column seems relevant here because it lists who did the remixing. If a song has someone listed in this column, it means it was remixed.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Album version**: No remixer is mentioned, so this isn't a remix.\n2. **Single version**: Similarly, no remixer here either.\n3. **Instrumental**: It's just \"laurent boutonnat\" as the remixer. So that's one song.\n4. **Aches remix**: This mentions both laurent boutonnat and bertrand chtenet. That's another song.\n5. **Pain killer mix**: Again, both are listed here, so that's a third.\n6. **Upside down remix**: Both remixers again, making it the fourth song.\n7. **Music video**: No remixer mentioned, so not relevant.\n8. **Live version (recorded in 1996)**: No remixer listed, so this isn't a remix.\n\nSo, from the table, I count four songs that have been remixed: instrumental, aches remix, pain killer mix, and upside down remix. Each of these has at least one person in the \"remixed by\" column, indicating they were remixed versions.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"5 songs.\" I only found four. Did I miss any? Let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't overlook anything.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- The first two rows (album and single versions) don't have remixers.\n- The instrumental is one song.\n- Aches remix is another.\n- Pain killer mix is third.\n- Upside down remix is fourth.\n\nI think that's it. There are four songs listed as remixed, not five. So the claim is incorrect because there aren't five songs with remixes mentioned in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells would be all the rows where \"remixed by\" is present to support this conclusion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the album version be the only 1 release in 1997\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim itself. It says that the album version was the only release in 1997. Looking at the table provided, I should check for any entries related to 1997 and see if the album version is indeed the sole release that year.\n\nLooking at the \"year\" column, the years listed are 1995, 1996, and 1996 again for some entries. There's no mention of a 1997 release in the table. The latest entry is from 1996, with some remixes and live versions. So, if there's no album version or any other releases in 1997, then the claim might be incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row. The first two rows are for 1995 and 1996. Starting from row 0: \"album version\" is 1995. Then row 1 is 1996 single version. Row 2 is 1996 instrumental. Rows 3,4,5,6,7 all have 1996 as the year. So no 1997 entries.\n\nThe claim says that in 1997, only the album version was released. But since there's no entry for 1997 at all in the table, it implies that either no releases happened in 1997 or they're not listed here. If the album version isn't even present in 1997, then the claim is false because it claims it's the only one but perhaps it wasn't released that year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The \"year\" column shows only up to 1996. So any release in 1997 wouldn't be reflected here. Therefore, the table doesn't support the claim because there are no entries for 1997, meaning the album version wasn't released that year either.\n\nThus, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "over 2 year , there be 7 version of the same song",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"over 2 year , there be 7 version of the same song.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like version, length, album, remixed by, and year. Each row represents a different version of the song.\n\nThe key points in the claim are:\n- Over 2 years (so from 1995 to 1997? Or maybe up to 1997 if considering the end of 1996)\n- Seven versions of the same song\n\nLooking at the table, I see entries from 1995 and 1996. The latest entry is in 1996 for the live version, so the time frame is likely between 1995 and 1996.\n\nNow, let's count how many versions there are in the table:\n1. album version\n2. single version\n3. instrumental\n4. aches remix\n5. pain killer mix\n6. upside down remix\n7. music video\n8. live version\n\nWait, that's actually 8 versions. But the claim says seven. So maybe I'm miscounting or perhaps the claim is considering only certain types as \"versions.\" Alternatively, perhaps some are not considered full versions.\n\nLooking again:\n- album version: original, so 1\n- single version: another edit, 2\n- instrumental: another arrangement, 3\n- aches remix: by two people, 4\n- pain killer mix: same as above, 5\n- upside down remix: same as above, 6\n- music video: maybe not a traditional version but tied to the song's release, so perhaps counts as one, making it 7.\n- live version: another take, possibly 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is considering only remixes or edits, excluding the album and single versions. But that doesn't seem right because each of these can be considered different versions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The table lists eight distinct entries, but the claim says seven. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are more than six versions beyond 1996.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the live version is not counted as a mix or a remix, so that would make it seven versions: album, single, instrumental, aches, pain killer, upside down, and music video. That's seven. But then the live version adds an eighth.\n\nWait, the claim says \"over 2 years,\" which likely refers to from 1995 onwards. The table shows entries up to 1996, so that's two years (from 1995 to 1996). Wait, no\u20141995 and 1996 are two years, but maybe including part of 1997? No, the last entry is 1996.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim says \"over 2 years\" meaning more than two years, so from 1995 to 1997. But in the table, the latest is 1996, which would be only two years after 1995 (1995 and 1996). So that's correct for the timeframe.\n\nNow, counting again: album version (1), single (2), instrumental (3), aches remix (4), pain killer mix (5), upside down (6), music video (7), live version (8). So eight versions in two years. The claim says seven, so it's false because there are more than six.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is considering only post-1995, which would include 1996 and perhaps part of 1997? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting \"over 2 years.\" If over two years from release, perhaps including 1997 as well. But in the table, all entries are up to 1996.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some versions aren't counted as official releases or proper versions, but that's subjective.\n\nIn any case, the table has eight entries, which is more than seven, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists eight different versions of the song across two years (1995 and 1996), exceeding the claim's stated seven. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
