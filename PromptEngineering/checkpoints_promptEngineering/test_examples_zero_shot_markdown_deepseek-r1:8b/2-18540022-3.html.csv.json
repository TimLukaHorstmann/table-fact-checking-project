    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3! be the japanese title of hanayome wa yakudoshi!\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two titles: \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" and \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\". The claim is asserting that \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" is the Japanese title of the series \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\".\n\nNext, I'll refer to the table provided. The table lists several Japanese titles, their romaji equivalents, the TV station, number of episodes, and average ratings. My goal is to find the row where the Japanese title matches \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\".\n\nLooking at the 'Japanese Title' column:\n\n1. The first entry is \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\" which translates to \"Sapuri\".\n2. The second is \"\u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e\", translating to \"Fushin no toki ~Woman Wars~\".\n3. Third entry: \"\u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537\" \u2192 \"Kekkon dekinai otoko\".\n4. Fourth: \"\u30c0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u3002\uff5edance\u2606drill\uff5e\" \u2192 \"Dandori~dance\u2606drill~\".\n5. Fifth: \"\u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30de\u30de\u3092\u611b\u3059\" \u2192 \"Dare yorimo mama wo ai su\".\n6. Sixth: \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" \u2192 This is exactly the title we're looking for.\n7. Seventh: \"\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f\" \u2192 \"Taiyou no uta\".\n8. Eighth: \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\" \u2192 \"Regatta~kimi to ita eien~\".\n9. Ninth: \"\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\" \u2192 \"Shimokita Sundays\".\n10. Tenth: \"ca\u3068\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3063!\" \u2192 \"Ca to oyobbi!\".\n11. Eleventh: \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" \u2192 \"My\u2606boss my\u2606hero\".\n\nNow, the claim is about \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\", which in English translates to \"Hanayome Wa Yakudoshi!\". Looking back at the table, I need to check if there's a matching entry. \n\nI notice that the sixth row has the Japanese title \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" and the romaji is listed as \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\" which perfectly matches the English title in the claim. So, this means the claim is asserting correctly that \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" is indeed the Japanese title of \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\".\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data. There's a direct match in both the Japanese title and its romaji equivalent for that specific series.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"japanese title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the romaji title regatta~kimi to ita eien~ have the fewest episode of 9 in total.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant cells. The claim mentions the romaji title \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~.\" So I need to find that row in the table.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row with \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\" translates to \"Regatta~kimi to Ita Eien~\" in romaji.\n- The episodes for this title are 9, as shown under the \"episodes\" column.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is indeed the one with the fewest episodes. Let's look at all the rows:\n\n1. \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\" (Sapuri) - 11 episodes\n2. \"\u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e\" (Fushin no toki ~Woman Wars~) -12 episodes\n3. \"\u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537\" (Kekkon dekinai otoko) -12 episodes\n4. \"\u30c0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u3002\uff5edance\u2606drill\uff5e\" (Dandori~dance\u2606drill~-11 episodes)\n5. \" \u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30de\u30de\u3092\u611b\u3059\" (Dare yorimo mama wo ai su) -11 episodes\n6. \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" (Hanayome wa yakudoshi!) -12 episodes\n7. \"\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f\" (Taiyou no uta) -10 episodes\n8. \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\" (Regatta~kimi to ita eien~-9 episodes\n9. \"\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\" (Shimokita Sundays) -9 episodes\n10. \"ca\u3068\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3063!\" (Ca to oyobbi!) -11 episodes\n11. \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" (My\u2606Boss My\u2606Hero) -10 episodes\n\nFrom this, the romaji title \"Regatta~kimi to Ita Eien~\" has 9 episodes, and so does \"Shimokita Sundays.\" So both have 9 episodes. The claim says it's the fewest, but there are two titles with 9 episodes.\n\nWait, the claim is about having the fewest total episodes of 9. But actually, both have 9, which means neither is exclusively the one with the fewest. Therefore, the statement might be misleading because more than one title has 9 episodes.\n\nBut let me double-check: the term \"fewest\" could imply that it's the lowest number, but in this case, since two titles share that number, does that mean the claim is incorrect? Or does the fact that there are other titles with higher episode counts make this correct?\n\nWait, no. The claim says that the romaji title has the fewest episodes of 9 in total. So it's not about being lower than others but having 9 as the fewest. But wait, actually, in the table, some have fewer: like \"Taiyou no uta\" has 10, \"Regatta\" and \"Shimokita Sundays\" have 9, which is less than 10 or higher numbers.\n\nBut looking at all episodes:\n\n- The minimum number of episodes here is 9 (for two titles).\n- So if the claim says that this title has the fewest (which would be 9), but there's another with the same number, then it's not the only one. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because \"fewest\" implies being unique.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me parse the claim again: \"the romaji title regatta~kimi to ita eien~ have the fewest episode of 9 in total.\" So it's saying this title has 9 episodes and that is the fewest. But since another title also has 9, then it's not unique, so the claim would be false because it's not the only one with the fewest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"fewest\" refers to having 9 being less than others, but in this case, some have lower (like 10 is higher, but 8.9% is another metric). Wait no, the number of episodes is what's being compared here, not ratings.\n\nSo, if two titles have 9 episodes, then \"the fewest\" would mean that both have 9, so the claim is incorrect because it's not just one title but two with the same lowest count.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are two titles (Regatta and Shimokita) with 9 episodes each.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" has the fewest episodes compared to all other titles in the table.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify the row for \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\":**\n   - The title is listed as \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\", which translates to \"Regatta~kimi to Ita Eien~\" in romaji.\n   - From the table, this title has 9 episodes.\n\n2. **Compare with other titles:**\n   - Other titles have varying episode counts:\n     - Titles like \"Taiyou no uta\" have 10 episodes.\n     - Some have higher (e.g., 12) or lower (e.g., 11).\n   - Additionally, \"\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\" (Shimokita Sundays) also has 9 episodes.\n\n3. **Determine the minimum number of episodes:**\n   - The lowest number of episodes among all titles is 9.\n   - Two titles share this minimum count (\"Regatta~kimi to Ita Eien~\" and \"Shimokita Sundays\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is false because both \"Regatta~kimi to Ita Eien~\" and \"Shimokita Sundays\" have the same lowest number of episodes, meaning neither has the fewest exclusively.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The Japanese title for \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" should be \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\".\n2. This specific series has less than 11 episodes.\n\nLet's start by finding the row in the table where the romaji title is \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\". \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: japanese title is \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\", which doesn't match.\n- Row 1: No match.\n- Row 2: No match.\n- Row 3: No match.\n- Row 4: No match.\n- Row 5: No match.\n- Row 6: No match.\n- Row 7: Japanese title is \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\", which matches.

Each row represents a different Japanese TV show with details like the Japanese title, romaji title, TV station, number of episodes, and average ratings.\n\nI need to focus on the specific information related to the claim. The key elements here are \"average rating\" and the specific episode number, which is 11, for the series titled \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea.\" \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row corresponds to \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea.\" \n- In this row, under \"episodes,\" it's listed as 11.\n- Under \"average ratings,\" it's 14.2%.\n\nSo, both pieces of information in the claim are present and match: there is an episode 11 for \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\" with an average rating of 14.2%. \n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table, making it TRUE.\n\nNow, to structure this into a JSON object as per the instructions, I need to identify which cells are relevant.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various Japanese TV shows and their details like the romaji title, the TV station, the number of episodes, and their average ratings. The claim is: \"when the average rating is 10.3%, the average episode be more than 10.0.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse this correctly. So, the claim says that if a show has an average rating of exactly 10.3%, then its average episodes are more than 10.0. But looking at the table, each row might have both an average rating and the number of episodes. So I should check for rows where the average rating is 10.3% and see if the number of episodes is more than 10.\n\nLet me look through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Average rating 14.2%, episodes 11 \u2192 Doesn't apply because rating isn't 10.3.\n2. **Row 1:** 12.9%, 12 episodes \u2192 No.\n3. **Row 2:** 17.1%, 12 \u2192 No.\n4. **Row 3:** 8.9%, 11 \u2192 No.\n5. **Row 4:** 10.4%, 11 \u2192 Not 10.3, but close.

So average rating is exactly 10.3% and number of episodes is 10. The claim says that when the average rating is 10.3%, the average episode should be more than 10.0. But in this case, it's exactly 10. So does 10 count as more than 10? No, because \"more than\" implies strictly greater than. So this doesn't support the claim.\n8. **Row 7:** 5.4%, 9 \u2192 No.\n9. **Row 8:** 9.5%, 11 \u2192 No.\n10. **Row 9:** 18.9%, 10 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, in row 6, the average rating is exactly 10.3% and episodes are 10. So according to the claim, when the average rating is 10.3%, episodes should be more than 10. But here it's 10, which is not more than 10.0. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nIn row 4, the average rating is 10.4%, which isn't exactly 10.3%. So that's a different case.\n\nSo actually, there are no rows where the average rating is exactly 10.3% and episodes are more than 10.0. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by any of the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when a show has an average rating of 10.3%, it should have more than 10 episodes. However, upon examining the table, only one row matches the average rating of 10.3% (Row 6) with exactly 10 episodes, which does not meet the \"more than 10\" criteria.

But clearly, that's not the case because there are others like Taiyou no uta, Shimokita Sundays, and My\u2606boss my\u2606hero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" isn't the sole show with less than 11 episodes; there are multiple others.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" is the only title with fewer than 11 episodes, we need to check each row's episode count.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Target Title**: Look for \"Regatta~kimi to ita eien~\".\n2. **Count Its Episodes**: It has 9 episodes.\n3. **Check Other Titles**: Compare with other shows in the table to see if any have fewer than 11 episodes.\n\nUpon checking:\n- **Taiyou no uta**: 10 episodes\n- **Shimokita Sundays**: 9 episodes\n- **My\u2606boss my\u2606hero**: 10 episodes\n\nThese three titles also have fewer than 11 episodes, confirming the claim's falsity.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says that \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" is the Japanese title of \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the Japanese titles in the table to see if \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" matches any. Scanning down, I see several entries. The fifth row has \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" as the romaji title, and the corresponding Japanese title is missing because it's under 'japanese title' column but seems to be empty or perhaps not filled in correctly. Wait, no, looking again, the 'japanese title' column actually does have entries. For example, the first row has \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\" as the japanese title with romaji \"sapuri.\" So each row should have both columns filled.\n\nWait, in the table provided, I think the structure is that each row lists the Japanese title (left), its Romaji translation (middle column), and other details on the right. Wait no, looking at the markdown:\n\n| japanese title                   | romaji title                | tv station   |   episodes | average ratings   |\n\nSo the first two columns are 'japanese title' and 'romaji title.' So each row has both.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 0: Japanese \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\" (Sapuri), Romaji \"sapuri\"\n\nRow1: Japanese \"\u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e\", Romaji \"fushin no toki ~woman wars~\"\n\nRow2: Japanese \"\u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537\", Romaji \"kekkon dekinai otoko\"\n\nRow3: Japanese \"\u30c0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u3002\uff5edance\u2606drill\uff5e\", Romaji \"dandori~dance\u2606drill~\"\n\nRow4: Japanese \" \u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30de\u30de\u3092\u611b\u3059\", Romaji \"dare yorimo mama wo ai su\"\n\nRow5: Japanese \" \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\", Romaji \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\"\n\nRow6: Japanese \" \u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f\", Romaji \"taiyou no uta\"\n\nRow7: Japanese \" \u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\", Romaji \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\"\n\nRow8: Japanese \" \u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\", Romaji \"shimokita sundays\"\n\nRow9: Japanese \" ca\u3068\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3063!\", Romaji \"ca to oyobbi!\"\n\nRow10: Japanese \" \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\", Romaji \"my\u2606boss my\u2606hero\"\n\nSo the claim is that \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" is the Japanese title of \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\" Looking at the table, in Row10, the japanese title is \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc,\" and the romaji is \"my\u2606boss my\u2606hero.\" Meanwhile, looking for \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!,\" which is in Row5: Japanese title is \" \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\", so it's not matching. Wait, no, Row5's Japanese title is \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" and the romaji is \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\" So in the 'japanese title' column for Row5, it's \" \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\", which translates to \"Hanayome wa Yakudoshi!\" But the claim says that the Japanese title of \"hanayome wa yakudoshi\" is \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9...\" \n\nWait, no. The claim says that \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9...\" is the Japanese title of \"hanayome wa yakudoshi.\" Looking at the table, in Row10, the japanese title is \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9...\", and the romaji is \"my\u2606boss my\u2606hero,\" while in Row5, the japanese title is \" \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" with romaji as \"hanayome wa yakudoshi.\" So the two titles are different.\n\nTherefore, \" hanayome wa yakudoshi! \" has a Japanese title of \" \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\", not \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9...\" So the claim is incorrect because \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9...\" corresponds to Row10's Japanese title, which is a different show.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists each TV show with its Japanese and Romaji titles. The claim asserts that \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" is the Japanese title of \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\" Checking the table:\n\n- In Row5, the Japanese title is \" \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\", translating to \"Hanayome wa Yakudoshi!\"\n- In Row10, the Japanese title is \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc,\" which translates to \"My\u2606Boss My\u2606Hero\"\n\nThus, the claim is false because the titles do not match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"japanese title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"japanese title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
