    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"brighton hotel bombing happened in Enniskillen, UK\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that the Brighton Hotel Bombing took place in Enniskillen, UK. So, I need to check the table provided and see if there's an entry that matches these details.\n\nLooking at the table columns: year, event, location, perpetrator(s), deaths. The claim mentions the event as \"brighton hotel bombing\" and the location as \"enniskillen, uk\". \n\nNow, I'll scan through each row of the table to find any that match both the event name and location.\n\nStarting from 1871: The first event is about an attack on a ship, not relevant. Similarly, the next few rows are about different events like newspaper bombings, which don't relate to Brighton Hotel.\n\nContinuing down, I see in row 1984: \"brighton hotel bombing\" with location \"brighton, uk\". So this matches the event name but not the location given in the claim, which is Enniskillen, UK. \n\nNext, there's another entry for 1987: \"remembrance day bombing\" in Enniskillen, but that's a different event, so it doesn't match.\n\nSo, looking through all the rows, I don't find any entry where both the event is \"brighton hotel bombing\" and the location is \"enniskillen, uk\". The only entry with the Brighton bombing is in Brighton itself, not Enniskillen. \n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because there's no evidence in the table supporting the occurrence of the Brighton Hotel Bombing in Enniskillen, UK.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1984, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the brighton hotel bombing happened in Brighton, UK\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions the \"brighton hotel bombing\" occurring in \"brighton, uk.\" So, my goal is to find if there's an entry in the table that matches both the event and the location specified.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row of the table for events related to Brighton or the hotel bombing. The columns I need to check are 'event,' 'location,' and maybe others like 'perpetrator' and 'deaths,' but primarily the event name and location.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1984, there's a \"brighton hotel bombing\" with the location listed as \"brighton, uk.\"\n- That matches both the event name and the location in the claim.\n  \nWait, that seems to support the claim. So, is it TRUE?\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant rows, just to be thorough. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. 1871: Mosel attack \u2013 not Brighton.\n2. 1910: LA Times bombing \u2013 LA, not Brighton.\n3. 1916: Preparedness Day \u2013 SF, nope.\n4. 1920: Wall Street \u2013 NYC.\n5. 1939: B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller \u2013 Munich.\n6. 1942: St Nazaire raid \u2013 France.\n7. 1944: July plot \u2013 Poland.\n8. 1955: United Airlines \u2013 CO, USA.\n9. 1972: Aldershot bombing \u2013 UK, but different location.\n10. 1974: M62 coach \u2013 West Yorkshire.\n11. 1974: Birmingham pub bombings \u2013 Birmingham.\n12. 1974: Guildford pub \u2013 Guildford.\n13. 1977: Lucona sinking \u2013 Indian Ocean.\n14. 1984: Brighton hotel bombing \u2013 Brighton, UK. This is the one we found earlier.\n15. 1987: Korean Air flight 858 \u2013 Andaman Sea.\n16. 1987: Remembrance Day \u2013 Northern Ireland.\n17. 1988: Pan Am 103 \u2013 Lockerbie, Scotland.\n18. 1989: Deal barracks \u2013 Kent, UK.\n19. 1994: Philippine Airlines \u2013 Between Cebu and Tokyo.\n20. 1996: Centennial Park \u2013 Atlanta.\n21. 1998: Omagh bombing \u2013 Northern Ireland.\n22. 1999: Russian apartment bombings \u2013 Moscow area.\n23. 2006: Moscow market \u2013 Moscow.\n\nSo, only the 1984 row matches both the event name and location mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by this table entry, making it TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row for 1984 has 'year' as 1984, 'event' as \"brighton hotel bombing,\" 'location' as \"brighton, uk,\" and so on. So, the relevant columns are 'event' at index 1 and 'location' at index 3. Hence, their row indices are 0 for year, but since we need event and location, it's row_index 4 (since indexing starts from 0) but wait, no\u2014the table uses |   year | ... So the first column is year, then event, then location, etc.\n\nWait, in the markdown table, the columns are:\n\nyear, event, location, perpetrator(s), deaths.\n\nSo, 'event' is column 1 (row_index 1?), and 'location' is column 3 (row_index 3). Let me count:\n\nColumns:\n0: year\n1: event\n2: location\n3: perpetrator(s)\n4: deaths\n\nSo for the 1984 row, row_index is 4. The relevant columns are 'event' (index 1) and 'location' (index 2). Wait, no, in the table, the columns after year are event, location, perpetrators, deaths.\n\nWait, in the markdown, it's:\n\n|   year | event                           | location                        | perpetrator (s)                      | deaths    |\n\nSo the order is: year, event, location, perpetrator(s), deaths. So for each row, the 'event' is column 1, and 'location' is column 2.\n\nWait no, in markdown tables, the columns are separated by |, so the first cell after year is 'event,' then 'location,' etc. So for a given row, the 'event' is at index 1 (since starting from 0), and 'location' is at index 2.\n\nBut wait, let me check:\n\nFor example, the first row:\n\n|   1871 | attack on the mosel (ship)      | bremerhaven                     | alexander keith , jr                 | 80        |\n\nSo year is column 0, event is 1, location is 2, perpetrator(s) is 3, deaths is 4.\n\nTherefore, for row_index 4 (1984), the 'event' is at column 1 and 'location' at column 2. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:4, column_name:'event'\n- row_index:4, column_name:'location'\n\nSo the JSON should include these two as relevant_cells.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is TRUE with those cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the Brighton hotel bombing occurred in Brighton, UK\" is supported by the provided data. The relevant information can be found in the 1984 entry of the table, specifically under the 'event' and 'location' columns.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"assertion\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The event 'brighton hotel bombing' occurred in the location 'brighton, uk' as per the data.\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
