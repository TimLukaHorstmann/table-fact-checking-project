    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"in the master tournament, tiger wood have win the most time out of all player.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to be about Tiger Woods winning the most times in the Masters Tournament compared to other players listed.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists various golf players with their countries, years they won, total wins, total points, and finishing positions. The relevant columns here are \"player,\" \"country,\" \"year(s) won,\" \"total,\" \"to par,\" and \"finish.\" \n\nThe key information needed to verify the claim is how many times each player has won the Masters. So I should focus on the \"year(s) won\" column for each player, especially Tiger Woods.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Tiger Woods has won in 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005. That's four wins.\n- The next highest is Phil Mickelson with two wins in 2004 and 2006.\n- Vijay Singh, Mike Weir, Zach Johnson, Ian Woosnam, and Sandy Lyle each have only one win.\n\nSo Tiger Woods has the most wins among all listed players. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each player's row has a \"year(s) won\" column where their victories are listed. For Tiger Woods, it's in row 0, column \"year (s) won.\" The other players also have this info in their respective rows.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are each player's \"row_index\" and the specific column checking their wins.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"with 2 wins, Phil Mickelson has won more times than Zach Johnson\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the components of the claim. The claim mentions two players: Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson. It states that with 2 wins, Mickelson has won more times than Johnson. So, I need to compare the number of wins each has according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I should locate both players' rows. Phil Mickelson is in row index 1, and Zach Johnson is in row index 5. Now, for each player, I'll check the \"year(s) won\" column to find out how many times they've won.\n\nFor Phil Mickelson (row index 1), the years are 2004 and 2006. That means he's won twice. The claim specifies that we're considering a scenario with 2 wins for him, so this is directly relevant.\n\nNow, checking Zach Johnson (row index 5), his year is only 2007. So, he has one win. \n\nComparing the two: Mickelson has 2 wins, and Johnson has 1 win. Therefore, with 2 wins, Phil Mickelson indeed has more wins than Zach Johnson.\n\nI should also verify if there's any other relevant information needed. The table includes columns like country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. For this claim, the key column is \"year(s) won\" because it directly relates to the number of wins each player has. So, I need to mark those cells as relevant.\n\nSo, for Phil Mickelson, the relevant cells are in row 1, column \"year(s) won\", specifically 2004 and 2006. For Zach Johnson, it's row 5, same column with 2007.\n\nPutting this together, the claim is supported by the data, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on comparing the number of wins between Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson. According to the table, Mickelson has 2 wins (2004, 2006), while Johnson has 1 win (2007). Therefore, with 2 wins, Mickelson has more wins than Johnson.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim is: \"the united state have have 3 player win in the master tournament.\" Hmm, first thing I notice is a possible typo in \"have have\" but I think it's meant to say \"have had.\" So, the claim is about how many players from the United States have won the Masters Tournament.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player, their country, years they've won, total, to par, and finish. The key columns here are 'player', 'country', and 'year(s) won.' \n\nSo, I need to check how many players from the United States have won the Masters. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Tiger Woods**: Country is the United States. Years won: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005. That's four wins.\n2. **Phil Mickelson**: Also from the US, but he only has two wins in 2004 and 2006.\n3. **Vijay Singh**: From Fiji, so not relevant for US players.\n4. **Mike Weir**: Canadian, not US.\n5. **Zach Johnson**: US, with a win in 2007.\n6. **Ian Woosnam**: Wales, doesn't count.\n7. **Sandy Lyle**: Scotland, no.\n\nSo, counting the US winners: Tiger Woods (4 wins), Phil Mickelson (2), and Zach Johnson (1). That's a total of four players from the US who've won the Masters as per the table data. Wait, but the claim says \"3 player win,\" which is three. But according to this count, it's four.\n\nWait, did I miss something? Let me check each row again. Tiger Woods: 4 wins, Phil Mickelson: 2, Zach Johnson: 1. That makes four US winners listed here. So the claim says \"3 players,\" but actually there are more than that. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\n- Tiger Woods: 4\n- Phil Mickelson: 2\n- Zach Johnson: 1\n\nThat's four total wins by US players in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Mike Weir is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Mike Weir have not win with under par for the nasters tournament.\" First, I should check the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various golf players along with their countries, years won, total points, to par, and finish. Mike Weir is one of the players listed. His row is row index 4. The columns relevant here are \"year (s) won,\" \"total,\" \"to par,\" and \"finish.\"\n\nNow, I need to verify if Mike Weir has ever won a Masters Tournament with an under par score. From the table, his total is 290 and to par is +2. In golf, \"under par\" typically means scoring less than par, which would be negative numbers like -1, -2, etc. However, in this context, since Mike Weir's to par is +2, that means he finished two strokes above par. So, he did not finish under par.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if the claim mentions \"nasters tournament\" correctly. The term used in the table might be a typo, perhaps referring to \"Masters Tournament.\" Regardless of the exact wording, Mike Weir's record shows he didn't win with an under par score in that year.\n\nTherefore, based on the information from the table, the claim is true because Mike Weir has not won the Masters Tournament with an under par finish.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking Mike Weir's total and to par values in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle is true based on the given table. The claim states: \"vijay singh have a final total win that be 13 under the score sandy lyle have when she win.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Understanding the Table:**\n   - The table lists several golf players along with their country, years won, total wins, total to par, and finish.\n   \n2. **Identifying Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle Data:**\n   - Vijay Singh is listed in row index 3 (since it's zero-indexed). His total wins are 289, and his finish is t14.\n   - Sandy Lyle is in row index 6. Her total wins are 302.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions \"vijay singh have a final total win that be 13 under the score sandy lyle have when she win.\"\n   - I need to check if Vijay Singh's total is 13 under Sandy Lyle's total wins. That would mean:\n     - Vijay's total = Sandy's total - 13.\n   \n4. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Vijay's total is 289.\n   - Subtracting 13 from Sandy's total (302 - 13 = 289).\n   - So, 289 equals 289, which means this condition holds true.\n\n5. **Checking Finish and Total to Par:**\n   - Vijay's finish is t14, while Sandy's is 45. The claim doesn't mention anything about the finish or total to par, so they aren't directly relevant here.\n   \n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculation checks out (289 = 302 -13), the claim is true.\n\nNow, I'll map this analysis to the relevant cells in the table. Vijay's row is index 3, columns 'total' and possibly others if needed. Similarly, Sandy's row is index 6, column 'total'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Vijay Singh: total (row 3)\n- Sandy Lyle: total (row 6)\n\nThese cells are necessary to verify the claim because they provide the numerical values used in the calculation.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Vijay Singh's total wins are 13 under Sandy Lyle's total. By checking their respective totals, we find this true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

I need to check how many times each of them won and see if this is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, the players listed are Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Mike Weir, Zach Johnson, Ian Woosnam, and Sandy Lyle. Each row has details like player name, country, years won, total, to par, and finish.\n\nI need to focus on the relevant columns: \"player,\" \"year(s) won,\" and maybe others if needed. The claim is about the number of wins in the Master Tournament, so I should look for the \"year(s) won\" column.\n\nStarting with Tiger Woods: His row shows years 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005. That's four wins.\n\nPhil Mickelson's row lists years 2004 and 2006. So that's two wins.\n\nWait, but the claim says Tiger has one fewer win than Phil. If Tiger won 4 times, Phil won 2 times, then Tiger actually has two more wins than Phil. So the claim is false because it states Tiger has one less win, which isn't correct; he has more.\n\nI should double-check if there's any confusion about the years or the number of wins. Tiger won in 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005\u2014four times. Phil won twice in 2004 and 2006. So Tiger indeed has two more wins than Phil, not one less.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Tiger has two fewer wins? Wait no, wait: If Tiger has 4 and Phil has 2, then Tiger has 2 more. The claim says Tiger has \"1 less time\" which would be Tiger having 3 and Phil having 4, but that's not what the table shows. So the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Tiger Woods' wins in the Master Tournament compared to Phil Mickelson:\n\n1. **Tiger Woods**: Won in 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 \u2192 Total of 4 wins.\n2. **Phil Mickelson**: Won in 2004, 2006 \u2192 Total of 2 wins.\n\nThe claim states Tiger has one fewer win than Phil, which is false because Tiger has two more wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, I'll look at their rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Phil Mickelson's row is in row index 1.\n- Zach Johnson's row is in row index 5.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many times each of them won. The \"year(s) won\" column shows that Phil Mickelson won in 2004 and 2006, so that's two wins. Zach Johnson only has a win in 2007, which is one win. \n\nWait, the claim says Phil has 4 more wins than Zach. But based on my count, Phil has 2 wins and Zach has 1. So, the difference here is 1, not 4. That seems to contradict the claim.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Let me count again: Phil's years are 2004, 2006\u2014yes, that's two. Zach only has 2007\u2014so one. The total wins for each would be their number of wins, so 2 vs. 1.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 1.

The claim is: \"Mike Weir only win 1 master tournament under par.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. I need to focus on Mike Weir's row because the claim is specifically about him.\n\nLooking for Mike Weir in the table, I see he is from Canada and won in 2003. His total score is 290, with a \"to par\" of +2, and he finished in t17 (which I assume means tied for 17th). \n\nNow, the claim mentions \"win 1 master tournament under par.\" So I need to check two things: whether Mike Weir won only one Masters and whether that win was under par.\n\nFrom the table, Mike Weir has won once, in 2003. So that's one Masters win so far. The next part is about being under par. Under par in golf terms means scoring less than par, which would result in a negative number (like -5 as in Tiger Woods). However, Mike Weir's total score is +2, which means he was two over par. So that would not be \"under par.\"\n\nWait, but sometimes people might refer to \"under\" as being below the target score, regardless of the actual par. But in this table, the term \"to par\" seems to indicate how much the player was above or below the target. For example, Tiger Woods is -5, Phil Mickelson is -2, Vijay Singh is +1, etc.\n\nSo Mike Weir's total is 290, and he's +2 to par. So he didn't finish under par; he finished two over. Therefore, the claim that he only won one Masters under par is incorrect because he actually finished above par in his win.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Mike Weir won 1 Master under par, but according to the table, he finished +2 (above par) in 2003.

Let's check each player:\n\n1. Tiger Woods: United States, years 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 \u2013 that's four wins.\n2. Phil Mickelson: United States, years 2004, 2006 \u2013 two wins.\n3. Vijay Singh: Fiji \u2013 not relevant for the claim.\n4. Mike Weir: Canada \u2013 same reason.\n5. Zach Johnson: United States, year 2007 \u2013 one win.\n6. Ian Woosnam: Wales \u2013 not relevant.\n7. Sandy Lyle: Scotland \u2013 irrelevant.\n\nSo, from the US, Tiger Woods has four wins, Phil Mickelson has two, and Zach Johnson has one. That's a total of three players who have won the Masters from the United States.\n\nThe claim says \"two players,\" but according to the table, it's actually three players. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The column names that matter here are 'player' and 'country'. Specifically, for each player from the US, their row index and the country column. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Tiger Woods: row 0\n- Phil Mickelson: row 1\n- Zach Johnson: row 5\n\nThese three players are from the US and have won the Masters. So the relevant cells would be the 'row_index' (0,1,5) and their respective 'country' columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, column 'player'\n- Row 0, column 'country'\n- Row 1, column 'player'\n- Row 1, column 'country'\n- Row 5, column 'player'\n- Row 5, column 'country'\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I need to list each relevant cell as a separate object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So for each of these rows, I'll include both columns.\n\nSo, for Tiger Woods (row 0):\n- {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n\nSimilarly for Phil Mickelson (row1) and Zach Johnson (row5).\n\nThat's a total of six cells. But wait, maybe I should only include the columns that are relevant to verifying the claim, which is whether the player is from the US and has won. So perhaps 'player' and 'country' are both relevant.\n\nYes, because to check if someone is from the US and has won, we need both their name (to identify they're a winner) and their country (to confirm it's the US). Therefore, each of these three players will have two cells: player and country.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"the united state have 2 player who win during the master tournament.\" Upon examining the table, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Zach Johnson are from the United States and have won the Masters. This is a total of three players, not two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells include each player's row index and their country for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Vijay Singh's final score is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"Vijay singh have a final score that be less than 10 under teh score of sandy lyle.\" Wait, there are some typos here\u2014\"the\" and \"tanh,\" but I think it means \"under\" as in below. So the corrected claim is probably about Vijay's total being less than Sandy Lyle's by more than 10.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant data for both Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle. Vijay's row is fifth on the list, so his index is 4 (since we start counting from 0). The columns I need are \"total\" and \"to par.\" Similarly, Sandy Lyle is the seventh row with index 6.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Vijay Singh has a total of 289.\n- To par: +1.\n- Sandy Lyle has a total of 302 and to par: +14.\n\nThe claim says Vijay's score is less than Sandy's by more than 10. Let me calculate the difference between their totals: 302 - 289 = 13. So Vijay is 13 under Sandy, which is more than 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Vijay Singh's final score is less than Sandy Lyle's by more than 10. From the table, we see:\n\n- Vijay Singh: Total 289\n- Sandy Lyle: Total 302\n\nDifference: 302 - 289 = 13, which is indeed more than 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
