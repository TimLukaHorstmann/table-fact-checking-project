    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"don whitehead & holly henderson be the writer for production code 3t7458.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's specifically about two writers\u2014Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson\u2014who are supposed to have written an episode with the production code 3t7458.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like title, director, writer(s), US air date, production code, and viewers. My task is to find the relevant cells that support or contradict this claim.\n\nI need to focus on the \"written by\" column and the \"production code\" column because the claim mentions both. The other columns like \"title,\" \"directed by,\" etc., might not be directly relevant unless they're part of verifying the connection between Don Whitehead, Holly Henderson, and the specific production code.\n\nStarting with the \"written by\" column: I need to find any rows where the writers are listed as Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 154: Writers are Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson. The production code is 3t7452.\n- Row 155: Caroline Dries alone. Not relevant.\n- Row 156: Al Septien & Turi Meyer. Not relevant.\n- Row 157: Bryan Q Miller. Not relevant.\n- Row 158: Kelly Souders & Brian Peterson. Not relevant.\n- Row 159: Todd Slavkin & Darren Swimmer. Not relevant.\n- Row 160: Caroline Dries. Not relevant.\n- Row 161: Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson. Production code is 3t7458. This matches the claim's production code.\n- Rows after that don't have the same writers or production code.\n\nSo, the only row where both the writers and production code match the claim is Row 154 with production code 3t7452, but wait, no\u2014the claim says 3t7458. Wait, in Row 161, Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson are the writers, and the production code is 3t7458. That's exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nTherefore, this row supports the claim. The relevant cells would be the \"written by\" column for that row and the \"production code\" column to confirm the code matches. \n\nSo, the row index for Row 161 is 161, and the columns are \"written by\" and \"production code.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Row 161 where Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson are the writers and the production code is 3t7458.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 161, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 161, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"glen winter be the director for production code 3t7461.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns like 'title', 'directed by', 'written by', etc., and each row corresponds to a specific episode with its production code.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find the row where the production code is 3t7461 and check if Glen Winter is listed as the director there. \n\nLooking through the table, I'll scan each row's production code until I find 3t7461. According to the table, production code 3t7461 is in row 166 (since it starts at 154, adding up each row's number). In that row, the 'directed by' column says \"michael rohl.\" So Glen Winter isn't the director for that production code.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The table goes from no=154 to no=173. The 166th row (since it's listed as 166) is the one with production code 3t7461, directed by Michael Rohl. So the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to find which columns are checked. The 'directed by' column and the 'production code' column are relevant because they directly relate to the claim about Glen Winter directing a specific production code.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 166, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 166, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instruction. The claim says: \"the song with production code 3t7471 have 4.11 viewer in the us\". \n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the production code matches 3t7471. Looking at the table, each row has a 'production code' column. Scanning through the codes: 3t7452, 3t7453, ..., up to 3t7470, and then 3t7471 is in row 173. \n\nNow, I need to check what the US viewers (million) are for this production code. From the table, row 173 has a 'us viewers' value of 3.23 million. The claim states that it's 4.11 million, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the viewer count listed in the table for production code 3t7471 is 3.23, not 4.11.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 173, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"don whitehead holly henderson write the song with the production code of 3t7463.\" \n\nNow, looking at the table structure, there are several columns relevant to this claim. The main ones seem to be:\n\n1. **Writer**: This column lists who wrote each episode.\n2. **Production Code**: This column has the code associated with each episode.\n\nThe claim mentions \"don whitehead holly henderson\" as the writers and associates it with a specific production code, 3t7463. So, I need to check if this pair of names is listed as the writers for any episode with that exact production code.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 154**: Written by don whitehead & holly henderson. Production code is 3t7452.\n- **Row 155**: Caroline Dries only. Not relevant.\n- **Row 156**: Al Septien & Turi Meyer. Not relevant.\n- **Row 157**: Bryan Q Miller. Not relevant.\n- **Row 158**: Kelly Souders & Brian Peterson. Not relevant.\n- **Row 159**: Todd Slavkin & Darren Swimmer. Not relevant.\n- **Row 160**: Caroline Dries. Not relevant.\n- **Row 161**: Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson again. Production code is 3t7458.\n- **Row 162**: Al Septien & Turi Meyer. Not relevant.\n- **Row 163**: Geoff Johns. Not relevant.\n- **Row 164**: Bryan Miller. Not relevant.\n- **Row 165**: Todd Slavkin & Darren Swimmer. Not relevant.\n- **Row 166**: Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson. Production code is 3t7464.\n- **Row 167**: Caroline Dries. Not relevant.\n- **Row 168**: Al Septien & Turi Meyer. Not relevant.\n- **Row 169**: Bryan Miller. Not relevant.\n- **Row 170**: Brian Peterson & Kelly Souders. Not relevant.\n- **Row 171**: Caroline Dries. Not relevant.\n- **Row 172**: Genevieve Sparling. Not relevant.\n- **Row 173**: Al Septien & Turi Meyer. Not relevant.\n\nWait, I might have missed some rows where \"don whitehead holly henderson\" appear as writers. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at Row 154 and Row 161, they both have \"don whitehead & holly henderson\" as the writers but with different production codes (3t7452 and 3t7458). The claim references a production code of 3t7463, which doesn't match either of these. \n\nNext, I should check if there's any row where the writers are \"don whitehead holly henderson\" *and* the production code is exactly 3t7463. From the table provided, that specific combination doesn't exist. The closest is Row 166, but its production code is 3t7464.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"don whitehead holly henderson write the song with the production code of 3t7463\" is **FALSE** because there's no matching row in the table where both conditions are met.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if \"don whitehead holly henderson\" wrote an episode with the production code 3t7463. By examining each row, none of them match both criteria simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 154, \"column_name\": \"Writer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 166, \"column_name\": \"Writer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"mairzee almas be the director for production code 3t7461.\" So I need to check if Mairzee Almas is listed as the director for that specific production code in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: no, -, title, directed by, written by, us air date, production code, and us viewers. My focus is on two main things: finding Mairzee Almas as the director and locating production code 3t7461.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where production code 3t7461 appears. Let's go row by row:\n\n- Row 154: Production code is 3t7452, not matching.\n- Row 155: 3t7453, nope.\n- Row 156: 3t7454.\n- Row 157: 3t7455.\n- Row 158: 377456, which seems different and probably belongs to a different show.\n- Row 159: 3t7457.\n- Row 160: 3t7459.\n- Row 161: 3t7458.\n- Row 162: 3t7460.\n- Row 163: 3t7461. Ah, here it is.\n\nSo production code 3t7461 is in row 163. Now I need to check who the director is for that row. Looking at the \"directed by\" column in row 163, it says \"jeannot szwarc.\" That's not Mairzee Almas. So according to this table, Mairzee Almas isn't listed as the director for production code 3t7461.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any rows or columns. Let me go through each row again just in case:\n\n- Row 164: Production code is 3t7462, directed by Morgan Beggs.\n- Row 165: 3t7463, Allison Mack.\n- Row 166: 3t7464, Michael Rohl.\n- Row 167: 3t7465, Glen Winter.\n- Row 168: 3t7466, Kevin G Fair.\n- Row 169: 3t7467, Mairzee Almas.\n- Row 170: 3t7468, James Marshall.\n- Row 171: 3t7469, Kevin G Fair.\n- Row 172: 3t7470, Michael Rohl.\n- Row 173: 3t7471, Tom Welling.\n\nYep, in none of these rows is production code 3t7461 assigned to Mairzee Almas. So the claim must be false because the director for that specific code isn't her.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 163, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
