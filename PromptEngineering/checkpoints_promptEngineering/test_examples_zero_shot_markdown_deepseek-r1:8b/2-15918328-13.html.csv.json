    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"sonya tayeh be the jazz choreographer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully examining each part of the problem.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. Each row represents a different dance performance with various details filled in those columns.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"sonya tayeh\" as the jazz choreographer. So, my main focus should be on the column labeled \"choreographer(s)\" because that's where choreographers are listed. I need to check if there's an entry for \"sonya tayeh\" in this column and whether it's associated with a performance that falls under the \"jazz\" style.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first two rows have \"courtney galiano mark kanemura\" as the couple. For both entries, the choreographer is different: Jason Gilkison for the Viennese Waltz and Sonya Tayeh for the jazz performance of \"the garden - mirah.\" Wait, that's interesting because the claim mentions Sonya Tayeh. So in row 1 (which is actually row index 0 if we start counting from zero), the choreographer is Jason Gilkison, but the style is jazz. However, in the same couple entry, for the second performance, Sonya Tayeh is listed as the choreographer for a different style (jazz again). Wait, no, looking back, actually, in row 0, it's Viennese Waltz with Jason Gilkison, and row 1 is jazz with Sonya Tayeh. So that's relevant because it mentions her name.\n\n2. The third row has \"katee shean joshua allen\" as the couple. Their performances are contemporary and paso doble, with choreographers Tyce Diorio both times. Not relevant here.\n\n3. The fourth and fifth rows involve Chelsie Hightower, which is about her elimination from different styles. Again, not relevant to Sonya Tayeh.\n\nSo focusing on row 1: couple is \"courtney galiano mark kanemura,\" style is jazz, music is \"the garden - mirah\" by Mirah, and choreographer is Sonya Tayeh. This directly mentions her as the jazz choreographer for that performance.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any other occurrence of Sonya Tayeh being a jazz choreographer elsewhere in the table. Looking through all rows again:\n\n- Only row 1 (second entry) lists Sonya Tayeh as the choreographer, and it's specifically for the jazz style.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"sonya tayeh be the jazz choreographer\" is supported by the information in the table because she is indeed listed as the choreographer for a performance under the jazz category.\n\nI should also note down which rows and columns are relevant to this verification. The relevant cells would be row 1 (index 0) and column \"choreographer(s)\" because that's where Sonya Tayeh is mentioned in relation to the jazz style.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data, as Sonya Tayeh is listed as the jazz choreographer for a performance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"choreographer(s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"1 safe result choreographed by Jason Gilkinson to 'Filet from Le R\u00eave'.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. The term \"safe result\" refers to a couple who was not eliminated and made it to the next round or the finale. The choreographer is specified as Jason Gilkinson, and the dance number is 'Filet from Le R\u00eave'. So, I need to check if there's exactly one safe result where Jason Gilkinson choreographed that specific dance number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different performance. The columns include couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. My focus should be on the \"results\" column for safety and the \"choreographer\" column matching Jason Gilkinson, along with the dance number 'Filet from Le R\u00eave'.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Couple is Courtney Galiano & Mark Kanemura, style Viennese Waltz, music 'The Time of My Life' by David Cook. Choreographer is Jason Gilkinson, result is Kanemura eliminated.\n   - Not safe, so irrelevant for the claim.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Same couple as row 0, style Jazz, music 'The Garden' by Mirah. Choreographer is Sonya Tayeh, result is Kanemura eliminated.\n   - Safe? No, because Kanemura was eliminated. Also, choreographer isn't Jason Gilkinson here.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Couple is Katye Shean & Joshua Allen, style Contemporary, music 'All By Myself' by Celine Dion. Choreographer is Tyce Diorio, result safe.\n   - Not relevant because choreographer isn't Jason Gilkinson and dance number doesn't match.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Same couple as row 2, style Paso Doble, music 'Filet from Le R\u00eave'. Choreographer is Jason Gilkinson, result safe.\n   - This seems relevant. The choreographer is Jason Gilkinson, and the dance number matches 'Filet from Le R\u00eave'. The result is safe.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Couple Chelsie Hightower & Stephen Twitch Boss, style Mambo, music 'Ahora Me Toca a Mi' by V\u00edctor Manuelle. Choreographers are Tony Meredith and Melanie Lapatin. Result: Hightower eliminated.\n   - Not relevant for the claim as choreographer isn't Jason Gilkinson.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Same couple as row 4, style Hip-Hop, music 'Control' by Vitamin String Quartet. Choreographers are Tabitha and Napoleon D'Umo. Result: Hightower eliminated.\n   - Again, not relevant.\n\nSo, only row 3 has a safe result where the choreographer is Jason Gilkinson for 'Filet from Le R\u00eave'. The claim says \"1 safe result,\" so that's accurate because there's exactly one such instance. Additionally, the dance number matches and the choreographer is correctly identified as Jason Gilkinson.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"choreographer(s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"katee shean joshua allen dance the contemporary piece\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions three things: katee shean, joshua allen, and dancing a contemporary piece. So I need to check if there's an entry in the table that matches these elements.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a dance performance with details like couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. The columns are: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), results.\n\nNow, let me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. First row: Couple is \"courtney galiano mark kanemura\", not relevant to katee shean.\n2. Second row: Same couple as first, different style (jazz), also irrelevant.\n3. Third row: Couple is \"katie shean joshua allen\". This matches part of the claim, \"katie shean joshua allen\". The style here is contemporary, which directly relates to the claim about dancing a contemporary piece. So this row seems relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Same couple as third, different style (paso doble), so not relevant for contemporary.\n5. Fifth and sixth rows: Couple is \"chelsie hightower stephen twitch boss\", so not relevant.\n\nSo in the third row, we have a match on both the couple (\"katie shean joshua allen\") and the style (\"contemporary\"). The music is \"all by myself - celine dion\" but since the claim doesn't mention this, it's not necessary for verification. The choreographers are tyce diorio, which isn't part of the claim either.\n\nThe results column in the third row says \"safe\", but again, that's about the outcome rather than what they danced. The claim is about what they did, so the result doesn't directly affect it, though it does show that they successfully performed the contemporary piece.\n\nTherefore, since there's a matching row with both the couple and style mentioned in the claim, the statement seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms that katee shean joshua allen danced a contemporary piece, aligning with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"style\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"katee shean joshua allen dance to filet from le r\u00eave and be choreographed by tyce diorio.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. The couple (dancers) perform a specific song.\n2. The choreographer for that performance is specified.\n\nI'll start by analyzing each row of the table to find where \"katee shean joshua allen\" are mentioned as the couple.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Couple is Courtney Galiano & Mark Kanemura\n- Row 1: Couple is Courtney Galiano & Mark Kanemura again\n- Row 2: Couple is Katye Shean & Joshua Allen\n- Row 3: Same couple as row 2\n- Row 4: Chelsie Hightower & Stephen Twitch Boss\n- Row 5: Same couple as row 4\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row 2 and row 3. Now, I'll check what each of these rows says.\n\nRow 2:\n- Style: contemporary\n- Music: \"all by myself - celine dion\"\n- Choreographer: Tyce Diorio\n- Results: safe\n\nRow 3:\n- Style: paso doble\n- Music: \"filet from le r\u00eave\"\n- Choreographer: Jason Gilkison\n- Results: safe\n\nWait, the claim mentions that Katye Shean & Joshua Allen dance to \"filet from le r\u00eave.\" Looking at row 3, yes, their music is \"filet from le r\u00eave.\" However, the choreographer listed in row 3 is Jason Gilkison, not Tyce Diorio. The claim states that they are choreographed by Tyce Diorio.\n\nNow, let's see if there's any mention of Tyce Diorio as a choreographer elsewhere. In row 2, the choreographer is Tyce Diorio, but in that case, their style is contemporary and song is \"all by myself.\" The claim doesn't refer to this performance but rather to \"filet from le r\u00eave,\" which is associated with Jason Gilkison.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly attributes the choreography of \"filet from le r\u00eave\" to Tyce Diorio when it's actually Jason Gilkison. So, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each relevant row in the table where Katye Shean and Joshua Allen are mentioned.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim is: \"katee shean joshua allen dance to all by myself celine dion in the paso doble style.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. It mentions three specific things:\n1. The dancers: katee shean and joshua allen.\n2. The song: all by myself by Celine Dion.\n3. The dance style: paso doble.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a performance with details like couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. \n\nI need to check if there's a row where all three of these elements match. So, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura\n- Style: viennese waltz\n- Music: the time of my life - david cook\n- Choreographer: jason gilkison\n- Result: kanemura eliminated\n\nThis doesn't match because the couple is different, style isn't paso doble, and music is different.\n\nRow 1:\n- Couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura\n- Style: jazz\n- Music: the garden - mirah\n- Choreographer: sonya tayeh\n- Result: kanemura eliminated\n\nAgain, no match as the couple and style don't fit.\n\nRow 2:\n- Couple: katee shean joshua allen\n- Style: contemporary\n- Music: all by myself - celine dion\n- Choreographer: tyce diorio\n- Result: safe\n\nHmm, the dancers and song are correct here. But the style is contemporary, not paso doble. So it's close but not a match.\n\nRow 3:\n- Couple: katee shean joshua allen\n- Style: paso doble\n- Music: filet from le r\u00eave\n- Choreographer: jason gilkison\n- Result: safe\n\nWait, this row has the correct dancers and style (paso doble), but the song is different. The music here is \"filet from le r\u00eave,\" which doesn't match \"all by myself.\" So it's not a direct match.\n\nRow 4:\n- Couple: chelsie hightower stephen twitch boss\n- Style: mambo\n- Music: ahora me toca a mi - v\u00edctor manuelle\n- Choreographer: tony meredith melanie lapatin assisting\n- Result: hightower eliminated\n\nNo match here either.\n\nRow 5:\n- Couple: chelsie hightower stephen twitch boss\n- Style: hip - hop\n- Music: control - vitamin string quartet\n- Choreographer: tabitha and napoleon d'umo\n- Result: hightower eliminated\n\nStill no match with the claim.\n\nSo, none of the rows directly match all three elements in the claim. The closest is row 3 where they have katee shean joshua allen dancing to a paso doble style, but the song isn't the one mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by any single row.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are multiple rows that might contribute to the claim being true. For example, maybe different parts of the claim are satisfied in different rows, but since it's an all-or-none situation, each relevant cell must support the entire claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if any row has two correct elements but not all three. However, for the claim to be fully supported, all mentioned elements need to align with a single row.\n\nSo, after reviewing each row, none of them match the exact combination of dancers, song, and style specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no corresponding row that includes all three correct details together.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"style\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"music\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"choreographer(s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the choreographer(s) for the style jazz be tyce diorio and sonya tayeh.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. Each row represents a performance or dance routine.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to the style \"jazz.\" So I should focus on rows where the style is jazz. Looking through the table, I see that there are two entries with \"jazz\" as the style:\n\n1. Courtney Galiano and Mark Kanemura performed \"the garden - mirah\" in the jazz style, choreographed by Sonya Tayeh.\n2. Katee Shean and Joshua Allen performed \"all by myself - celine dion\" in the contemporary style, which is not relevant here.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the second row has \"jazz\" as a column? Let me check:\n\n- The first row: style is \"jazz,\" choreographers are Sonya Tayeh.\n- The second row: style is \"contemporary,\" so not relevant.\n- The third row: contemporary, irrelevant.\n- Fourth row: paso doble, irrelevant.\n- Fifth row: mambo, irrelevant.\n- Sixth row: hip-hop, irrelevant.\n\nSo only the first row in the table has a style of \"jazz.\" In that row, the choreographer(s) are listed as Sonya Tayeh. The claim mentions two choreographers: Tyce Diorio and Sonya Tayeh. But according to the table, only Sonya Tayeh is listed for the jazz style.\n\nWait, but in another part of the table, Katee Shean's contemporary routine was choreographed by Tyce Diorio. So does that mean Tyce Diorio is a choreographer in the same dance competition? The claim refers specifically to the style \"jazz,\" though.\n\nSo for the style \"jazz,\" the only choreographer mentioned is Sonya Tayeh, not Tyce Diorio. Therefore, the claim that both Tyce Diorio and Sonya Tayeh were choreographers for the jazz style is incorrect because only Sonya Tayeh is listed in that specific row.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. The first row: couple is Courtney Galiano and Mark Kanemura, style is jazz, music is \"the garden - mirah\" by Mirah, choreographed by Sonya Tayeh, and the result is \"kanemura eliminated.\" So yes, only Sonya Tayeh is the choreographer there.\n\nThe claim says both Tyce Diorio and Sonya Tayeh were the choreographers for style jazz.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"katee shean joshua aleen dance a jazz style and be safe.\" \n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. Each row seems to represent a different performance or routine by a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of the claim correspond to the table data. The key elements in the claim are:\n1. The person: \"katee shean joshua aleen\" \u2013 Wait, that's slightly different from the names in the table. In the table, there's a couple named \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen.\" So I need to check if \"joshua aleen\" is actually \"joshua allen.\" There might be a typo here. But before jumping to conclusions, let me double-check.\n\nLooking at row 2 and row 3 in the table:\n- Row 2: couple is \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen,\" style is contemporary, music is \"all by myself\" by Celine Dion, choreographer is Tyce Diorio, result is safe.\n- Row 3: same couple, different style (paso doble), different music (\"filet from le r\u00eave\"), same choreographer and result.\n\nWait, in the claim, it says \"katee shean joshua aleen.\" The correct spelling seems to be \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen\" as per the table. So there's a discrepancy between the claim and the table. That might make the claim FALSE already because the names don't match.\n\nBut let me proceed further. Suppose I'm not sure if it's a typo or perhaps a different couple. Let me check all rows for \"katee shean joshua allen.\" Looking through the table:\n\nI see two entries where the couple is \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen,\" which matches more accurately. The claim has \"katee shean joshua aleen\" which seems to be a variation, possibly a typo.\n\nAssuming that it's a typo and they meant \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen,\" then let's look for the relevant information in the table.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"dance a jazz style.\" Looking at the table, each row lists the style. I need to see if any of the rows where the couple is \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen\" has a style of jazz.\n\nLooking at row 2: style is contemporary.\nRow 3: style is paso doble.\nSo there's no jazz style for this couple in the table. Therefore, if the claim says they danced a jazz style, that would be incorrect because it doesn't match any of their entries.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the styles. The table has several styles: viennese waltz, jazz, contemporary, paso doble, mambo, hip-hop.\n\nIn row 2, the couple \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen\" has a style of contemporary.\nRow 3 is paso doble.\nSo no jazz style for this particular couple. Therefore, if the claim says they danced jazz, that's not supported by the table.\n\nNow, the last part of the claim: \"be safe.\" Looking at the results column, row 2 and row 3 both have \"safe\" as their result.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n- The names in the claim don't exactly match the couple in the table (assuming a typo).\n- Even if we ignore the name discrepancy for a moment, looking at their performances, they didn't perform jazz style; instead, they did contemporary and paso doble.\n- However, both their performances resulted in \"safe.\"\n\nSo the claim is making two points: that the couple danced jazz style and were safe. From the table:\n- They did not dance jazz (their styles are contemporary and paso doble).\n- They were safe in both their dances.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect (they didn't perform jazz), so regardless of whether it's a typo or not, the statement is FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe the user intended \"katee shean joshua allen\" instead of \"aleen.\" If that's the case, let me see if any other rows have their name. Looking through the table:\n\nOnly rows 2 and 3 have the couple as \"kat\u00e9e shean joshua allen,\" not \"katee shean joshua aleen.\" So even if it's a typo, there's no matching row with that exact name.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect on both counts: the style and possibly the name. But since the name discrepancy affects the verification process, I think we can't find any support in the table for this claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes a couple whose name does not exactly match any entry in the table (possibly due to a typo) and specifies a style (\"jazz\") that isn't performed by them. Even though their results are safe, the incorrect style makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"style\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
