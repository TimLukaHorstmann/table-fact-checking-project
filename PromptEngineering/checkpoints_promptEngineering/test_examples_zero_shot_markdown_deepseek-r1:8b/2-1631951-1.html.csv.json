    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the record mph (km / h) speed at coniston water be set by malcolm campbell as pilot.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions a record speed at Coniston Water, set by Malcolm Campbell who is acting as a pilot. So, I'm looking for entries in the table that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: speed (which might be \"-\", but maybe it's missing data), craft, pilot(s), location, and date. I need to scan through these rows to find where Malcolm Campbell is the pilot at Coniston Water.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first few rows have pilots like Casey Baldwin and Gar Wood, not Malcolm.\n2. Moving down, around row 4 (index 3), I see \"jules fisher\" as the pilot for the Farman Hydroglider at River Seine\u2014nope.\n3. Then there's George Wood and Kaye Don involved with Miss America II in Detroit River\u2014still not Coniston Water or Malcolm.\n4. By row 7 (index 6), we have \"henry segrave\" at Windermere, but it's about Miss England II\u2014not relevant.\n5. Continuing down, I notice that starting from row 9 (index 8), there are multiple entries for Malcolm Campbell as the pilot with various crafts like Bluebird K3 and Bluebird K7.\n6. Specifically, row 12 (index 11) is about the Bluebird K7 at Coniston Water. The pilot here is Malcolm Campbell, so that's a match.\n\nWait, but I should make sure if this is the first time he set a record or if there are others. Looking further, after row 11, there are more entries for Malcolm Campbell at Coniston Water: Bluebird K3 on 17 September 1938 and Bluebird K4 on 19 August 1939, but those might be later records. However, the claim is about setting a record, so maybe any of these would do.\n\nBut in the table, I see that there's also a row (row 12) where Malcolm Campbell set a speed at Coniston Water. So that directly matches the claim: pilot is Malcolm Campbell, location is Coniston Water, and it's about speed records.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the ones where the location is Coniston Water and the pilot is Malcolm Campbell. Looking back at the table:\n\n- Row 11 (index 10): Bluebird K7, Coniston Water, Malcolm Campbell\u2014yes.\n- Row 12 (index 11): same as above.\n- Wait, no, looking again: row indices might be different because the table starts from 0? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the first row is index 0. So row 0 is speed -, craft hd -4, etc., up to row 21 (since there are 22 rows).\n\nSo, for Malcolm Campbell at Coniston Water:\n\nLooking through the table, I see that starting from row 17 (which would be the Bluebird K7 entries). Let me list them out:\n\n- Row 10: pilot is Donald Campbell. No.\n- Row 11: Bluebird K7, Coniston Water, pilot Malcolm Campbell. Yes.\n- Then rows after that also have Malcolm as pilot at Coniston Water.\n\nSo, in the table, row 11 (row_index=10?) Wait no, let me recount:\n\nLooking again, the table has 22 rows. So row indices are from 0 to 21.\n\nThe first Bluebird K7 entry is at row 17: yes, index 16? Let me count properly:\n\nWait, the table starts as:\n\nRow 0: speed -, craft hd-4\nRow1: miss america, etc.\n...\nLooking for Malcolm Campbell entries:\n\nAt row 11 (index=10?), no. Let me check each entry.\n\nLooking at the \"pilot\" column:\n\nSearching through each row's pilot:\n\n- Casey Baldwin, Gar Wood, Jules Fisher, George Wood, Henry Segrave, Kaye Don, Donald Campbell, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The claim is about Malcolm Campbell, so I need to find rows where pilot is Malcolm.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 16: Bluebird K7, Coniston Water, pilot Malcolm Campbell (row_index=16)\nRow 17: same as above but different date\nRow 18: Bluebird K3 at Coniston Water, Malcolm Campbell\u2014wait no, Bluebird K3 was before.\n\nWait, in the table provided by the user, let me parse it correctly:\n\nLooking for pilot = \"Malcolm Campbell\":\n\nFrom the table, here's the breakdown:\n\n- Row 0: Casey Baldwin\n- ...\n- Row 8: Henry Segrave\n- Row 9: Kaye Don\n- Row10: George Wood\n- Row11: Kaye Don\n- Row12: Henry Segrave\n- Row13: Jules Fisher\n- Row14: George Wood\n- Row15: Kaye Don\n- Row16: Malcolm Campbell (Bluebird K7 at Coniston Water)\n- Row17: Malcolm Campbell (Bluebird K7, same location)\n- Row18: Donald Campbell\n- Row19: Malcolm Campbell (Bluebird K3 at Coniston Water)\n- Row20: Malcolm Campbell (Bluebird K4 at Coniston Water)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me re-examine the table structure.\n\nActually, the table is presented as a list of rows, each with columns:\n\nRow 0:\nCraft: hd -4\nPilot: Casey Baldwin\n\nRow1:\nCraft: miss america\nPilot: Gar Wood\n\n...\n\nLooking at row 10 (index=10):\n\nCraft: Bluebird K7\nLocation: Coniston Water\nPilot: Malcolm Campbell\n\nSo that's the first occurrence.\n\nThen, row11 (index=11): same craft and location, pilot Malcolm.\n\nWait no, let me recount. The table has 22 rows, so indices 0-21.\n\nLooking for \"Malcolm Campbell\" in the pilot column:\n\nRow10 (index=9? Or index=10?)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all pilots:\n\nFrom row 0:\nPilot: Casey Baldwin\n\nrow1: Gar Wood\n\nrow2: Jules Fisher\n\nrow3: George Wood\n\nrow4: Kaye Don\n\nrow5: Henry Segrave\n\nrow6: Kaye Don\n\nrow7: George Wood\n\nrow8: Henry Segrave\n\nrow9: Jules Fisher\n\nrow10: George Wood\n\nrow11: Kaye Don\n\nrow12: Henry Seagra (maybe a typo, but it's Henry)\n\nrow13: Jules Fisher\n\nrow14: George Wood\n\nrow15: Kaye Don\n\nrow16: Malcolm Campbell\n\nrow17: Malcolm Campbell\n\nrow18: Donald Campbell\n\nrow19: Malcolm Campbell\n\nrow20: Malcolm Campbell\n\nSo rows 16,17,19,20 have Malcolm Campbell as pilot.\n\nNow, among these, which ones are at Coniston Water?\n\nLooking at the location column:\n\nRow16: Coniston Water\nRow17: same location\nRow19: Coniston Water\nRow20: Coniston Water\n\nYes, so rows 16,17,19,20 have Malcolm Campbell as pilot and location Coniston Water.\n\nTherefore, these are the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by multiple entries in the table where Malcolm Campbell set speed records at Coniston Water. These specific rows are:\n\n- Row 16 (index=16)\n- Row 17 (index=17)\n- Row 19 (index=19)\n- Row 20 (index=20)\n\nEach of these corresponds to a record speed being set by Malcolm Campbell as the pilot at Coniston Water.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Pilot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"On 31 December 1964, Donald Campbell piloted a Bluebird K7 at Lake Dumbleyung.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see what information is in the table.\n\nStarting with the date: 31 December 1964. I'll scan through the 'date' column to find this exact date. Looking at the table, one entry has \"31 december 1964\" under date, so that's relevant. The row index for this entry is 28.\n\nNext, the pilot's name is Donald Campbell. Checking the 'pilot (s)' column, I see multiple entries with Donald Campbell. For example, rows 14, 15, 16, and others have his name, but specifically looking for the date, I can confirm that row 28 also lists Donald Campbell as the pilot.\n\nNow, checking the 'craft' column for that specific entry (row 28), it says \"bluebird k7.\" So that matches as well.\n\nThe location is Lake Dumbleyung. Looking at the 'location' column, there's an entry with \"lake dumbleyung\" on row 28. So that's correct too.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the table entry in row 28 for date, pilot, craft, and location, the claim is fully verified.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each part: date, pilot, craft, and location.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the claim \"donald campbell be the pilot at lake guntersville\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Donald Campbell was the pilot during an event at Lake Guntersville.\n\nFirst, I need to check each relevant cell in the table to see if there's any entry where Donald Campbell was the pilot and the location was Lake Guntersville. \n\nLooking at the \"pilot (s)\" column and the \"location\" column, I should find rows that have both \"Donald Campbell\" as the pilot and \"Lake Guntersville\" as the location.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Pilot is Casey Baldwin, Location is Bras d'Or Lake. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Pilot is Gar Wood, Location is Detroit River. No match.\n- Row 2: Pilot is Gar Wood again, same location. Still not matching.\n- Rows 3 to 4: Jules Fisher and George Wood as pilots, different locations.\n- Rows 5-7: Gar Wood and Henry Segrave, none at Lake Guntersville.\n- Row 8: Gar Wood, Indian Creek.\n- Row 9: Kaye Don, Paran\u00e3\u00a1 River.\n- Row 10: Kaye Don, Lake Garda. Not matching.\n- Row 11: Gar Wood, Indian Creek again.\n- Rows 12-14: Henry Segrave and others, different locations.\n- Row 15: Kaye Don, Loch Lomond.\n- Row 16: Gar Wood, St Clair River.\n- Rows 17-20: Bluebird K3 and Malcolm Campbell at Lake Maggiore. Not Guntersville.\n- Rows 21-23: Slo-Mo-Shun IV with different pilots. No.\n- Rows 24-26: Stanley Sayres and Ted O Jones, then Elmer Leninschmidt. Lake Washington, so no.\n- Row 27: Bluebird K7, Donald Campbell, location Ullswater. Not Guntersville.\n- Row 28: Donald Campbell, Lake Mead. Close but not Guntersville.\n- Rows 29-32: All at Coniston Water except row 33 (Lake Dumbleyung). No match for Lake Guntersville yet.\n- Row 34: Hustler with Lee Taylor, Location is Lake Guntersville. So here we have a pilot named Lee Taylor, not Donald Campbell.\n- Rows 35 and 36: Spirit of Australia, Ken Warby at Blowering Dam. Not relevant.\n\nWait, I didn't see any row where \"Donald Campbell\" is the pilot and location is Lake Guntersville. The only mention of Lake Guntersville is in Row 34, but with Lee Taylor as the pilot.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry in the table that matches both conditions: Donald Campbell being the pilot and the location being Lake Guntersville.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pilot (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
