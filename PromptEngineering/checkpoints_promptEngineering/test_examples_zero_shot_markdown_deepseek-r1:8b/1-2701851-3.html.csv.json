    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is true or false by checking against the given table. The claim is: \"201a be the production code of the 14a series and 1a season, title spontaneously combustible which be direct by igor kovalyov.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. Let's see:\n\n1. Production code: 201a\n2. Series number: 14a\n3. Season number: 1a\n4. Title: Spontaneously Combustible\n5. Directed by: Igor Kovalyov\n\nI need to verify each part of the claim against the table.\n\nStarting with the production code, I look at the table and find that the first row corresponds to series '14a' and season '1a'. The production code for this entry is '201a', which matches the first part of the claim. So that's correct.\n\nNext, checking the title: the title column for series 14a and season 1a is indeed \"spontaneously combustible.\" That checks out too.\n\nNow, looking at who directed it. The table lists the director as 'igor kovalyov' for 14a in series and 1a in season. Wait, actually, in the row where series is 14a and season 1a, the director is listed as igor kovalyov? Let me double-check the spelling.\n\nLooking back at the table: yes, it's 'igor kovalyov'. The claim says 'igor kovalyov' which matches. So that part is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect of the claim aligns with the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}]}",
