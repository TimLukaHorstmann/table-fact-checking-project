    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Stevens Institute for Technology be based in Rapid City, South Dakota.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see if there's an entry for Stevens Institute of Technology. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the first column, which is the school name. Scanning down, I see \"Stevens institute of technology\" in row 17. So that's relevant because it matches the claim's institution name.\n\nNext, I need to check where Stevens Institute for Technology is located according to the table. The location column should have that information. From the table, row 17 has \"hoboken, new jersey.\" So the actual location is Hoboken, New Jersey, not Rapid City, South Dakota.\n\nSo the claim is stating that Stevens is in Rapid City, but according to the table, it's actually in Hoboken, NJ. Therefore, the claim is false because the location doesn't match.\n\nNow, considering the relevant cells: since the claim references both the name of the institution and its location, I should include both columns from the row where Stevens Institute is listed. The row index for Stevens is 17. The columns are \"school\" and \"location.\"\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because the location doesn't match what's claimed. The relevant cells are school at row 17 and location at row 17.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"hoboken , new jersey be where a private school that be found in 1870 be locate.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. There's a column called \"location\" and another called \"founded.\" The key points here are the location being Hoboken, New Jersey, and the year 1870 as the founding year.\n\nLooking through the table, I should find any schools that were founded in 1870 and located in Hoboken, New Jersey. Let's go row by row.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Air Force Institute of Technology: Founded in 1919, so no.\n- California Institute of Technology: 1891, not 1870.\n- California Polytechnic State University: 1901, not matching.\n- California State Polytechnic University, Pomona: 1938, nope.\n- Clarkson University: 1896, close but not 1870.\n- Colorado School of Mines: 1874, which is after 1870. So maybe not.\n- Colorado Technical University: 1965, too recent.\n- Florida Institute of Technology: 1958, no.\n- Georgia Institute of Technology: 1885, closer but not exactly 1870.\n- Illinois Institute of Technology: 1890, almost there but not quite.\n- Massachusetts Institute of Technology: 1861, earlier than 1870.\n- Michigan Technological University: 1885, same as Georgia.\n- Missouri University of Science and Technology: 1870. Oh, this one is founded in 1870.\n- Montana Tech of the University of Montana: 1900, nope.\n- New Jersey Institute of Technology: 1881, not 1870.\n- New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology: 1889, after.\n- Oregon Institute of Technology: 1947, too late.\n- Polytechnic Institute of New York University: 1854, earlier.\n- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: 1824, way before.\n- Rochester Institute of Technology: 1829, nope.\n- Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology: 1874, which is after 1870 but not exactly matching the claim's \"found in 1870.\"\n- South Dakota School of Mines and Technology: 1885, same as some others.\n- Stevens Institute of Technology: 1870. Wait, here we go! Stevens is located in Hoboken, New Jersey and was founded in 1870. That fits perfectly.\n\nSo the claim says that Hoboken, NJ has a private school founded in 1870. Stevens Institute of Technology matches both criteria. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hoboken, New Jersey houses a private school established in 1870. By examining the table, **Stevens Institute of Technology** is located in Hoboken, NJ and was founded in 1870, fulfilling the conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"air force institute of technology be a private institute found in 1889\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two main points: the school's name, its status as private, and its founding year. So I need to verify both of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various schools with their details. Let me find the row for \"air force institute of technology.\" Scanning down, I think it's the first row since the header is \"school\" and the first entry is \"air force institute of technology.\"\n\nSo in the first data row (row_index: 0), the school is listed as \"air force institute of technology.\" Now, checking the columns:\n\n- School: That's obviously relevant because the claim refers to this exact name.\n- Location: Not directly related to the claim about being private or founded in 1889.\n- Control: This column has values like public or private. For the air force school, control is \"public.\" Wait, that's a problem. The claim says it's private, but according to the table, it's public. So that contradicts the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me make sure I'm looking at the right row. Yes, it's the first data row after the headers. Control is \"public,\" so the school is a public institution, not private as claimed.\n\nAlso, checking the founded column for this row: It says 1919. The claim states 1889, which doesn't match either. So both points in the claim are incorrect based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the air force institute is actually public and was founded in 1919, not 1889 as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"air force institute of technology be a private institute found in 1889\" is false. The table indicates that it is a public institution established in 1919.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"control\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
