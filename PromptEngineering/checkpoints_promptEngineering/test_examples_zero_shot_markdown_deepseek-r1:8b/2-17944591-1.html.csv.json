Similarly, Rodney Rowe's name is also under \"rodney rowe\", and his position is listed as \"fw\" as well.\n\nWait, both of them have the same position \"fw\"? Let me double-check. Mark Ward: \"position\" is \"fw\". Rodney Rowe: position is also \"fw\". So that seems correct.\n\nNext, I need to make sure their positions are indeed the same. From the table:\n\n- For Mark Ward, under \"name\" row, \"position\" is \"fw\".\n- For Rodney Rowe, under his name row, \"position\" is \"fw\".\n\nSo both have the position of forward (fw).

Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has a lot of columns: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, and total goals. My focus is on \"total goals\" for two specific individuals: Andy Turner and Pat Scully.\n\nLet me find where these two are in the table. I'll scan through the names:\n\n- Andy Turner is in row 18, column 'mf' (midfield).\n- Pat Scully is in row 15, column 'df' (defender).\n\nNow, I need to check the \"total goals\" for each of them.\n\nLooking at Andy Turner's row, under \"total goals\", it says 1. So that's his total goal count.\n\nPat Scully's row has a \"total goals\" of 1 as well.\n\nWait, both have 1 as their total goals? That would mean they do have the same amount. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything.\n\nAndy Turner: Total goals = 1.\nPat Scully: Total goals = 1.\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the claim is saying that both have the same number of total goals, which is true based on the table provided.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other columns that might be relevant, but in this case, only \"total goals\" matters for the claim. So I'll note down their respective row indices and column names for \"total goals\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because both have 1 total goal each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Rodney Rowe and Pat Scully in the table. Looking at the 'name' column, I see that Rodney Rowe is listed as a forward (fw) with some stats. Pat Scully is also a defender (df). \n\nNow, I need to find their respective goal statistics. For each player, I'll look for \"total goals\" and maybe \"league goals\" or \"fa cup goals\" just in case. \n\nStarting with Rodney Rowe: In his row, under 'total goals', it's 2. His 'fa cup goals' is also 1, but since the claim doesn't specify competition, I think total goals is sufficient.\n\nFor Pat Scully: Under 'total goals', it says 1. So Pat Scully has scored a total of 1 goal in his career according to the table.\n\nComparing the two, Rodney Rowe's total goals (2) are higher than Pat Scully's (1). Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the total goals column.\n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant information that might affect this conclusion. The 'league goals' for both is zero, and the 'fa cup goals' for Rodney is 1, but since his total is higher than Pat's total, it doesn't change the outcome.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim holds TRUE because Rodney Rowe has more total goals than Pat Scully.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"andy booth and ronnie jepson both have over 10 total goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at how to verify this. I think I'll start by locating Andy Booth and Ronnie Jepson in the table. Let me scan through each row.\n\nAndy Booth is listed as a forward (fw) with his stats. His total goals are shown in the \"total goals\" column. Similarly, Ronnie Jepson is also a forward, so I'll check his total goals too.\n\nLooking at Andy Booth's row: his total goals are 21. That's definitely over 10. Now, Ronnie Jepson has total goals of 14. Hmm, 14 is more than 10 as well. So both have more than 10 total goals.\n\nWait, but the table might have different formats. Let me double-check the columns to make sure I'm looking at the right ones. The \"total goals\" column seems straightforward, so yes, it's correct.\n\nSo, Andy Booth has 21 and Ronnie Jepson has 14. Both are above 10. That means the claim should be true. \n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells in the table for each person. For Andy Booth, his row index is probably around where he is listed\u2014maybe row 1 or so. Wait, let me count the rows properly.\n\nLooking back at the table, the first few rows are:\n1. simon baldry\n2. andy booth\n3. kenny brown\n4. darren bullock\n5. simon collins\n6. tom cowan\n7. gary crosby\n8. paul dalton\n9. iain dunn\n10. lee duxbury\n11. jon dyson\n12. rob edwards\n13. steve francis\n14. kevin gray\n15. steve jenkins\n16. ronnie jepson\n17. richard logan\n18. lee makel\n19. tony norman\n20. paul reid\n21. rodney rowe\n22. pat scully\n23. lee sinnott\n24. ben thornley\n25. simon trevitt\n26. andy turner\n27. mark ward\n28. jon whitney\n\nSo, Andy Booth is in row 2, and Ronnie Jepson is in row 16.\n\nThe columns for their total goals are \"total goals,\" which is the last column. So each of their rows has a cell in that column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- For Andy Booth: row_index 1 (since it's zero-indexed), column \"total goals\"\nWait, no. Wait, row indices start at 0. So Andy Booth is in row 2? No, if the first row is index 0, then he's at index 1. Let me clarify:\n\nRow numbers as per the list I made:\nsimon baldry - 0\nandy booth -1\nkenny brown -2\n...\nronnie jepson -15 (since 16th item in the list but starting from 0). Wait, no, the count is different.\n\nWait, actually, let me list them properly with their indices:\n\nRow 0: simon baldry\nRow 1: andy booth\nRow 2: kenny brown\n...\nContinuing up to Row 28 for jon whitney.\n\nSo Andy Booth is at row 1, column \"total goals\" which would be in the last column. Similarly, Ronnie Jepson is at row 16 (since he's the 17th item, so index 16), same column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"total goals\"}\n- {\"row_index\":16, \"column_name\":\"total goals\"}\n\nSo putting it all together, both have over 10 total goals, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}, {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}]}",

That matches what the claim says for Lee Sinnott.\n\nNext, Simon Trevitt: Again, scanning through the rows, Simon Trevitt is listed in row 23 (if starting count from 0) or 24.

The claim is: \"andy turner score more total goal than pat scully.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: andy turner's total goals and pat scully's total goals. Then, I need to see which column in the table represents each of these.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns like \"name,\" \"position,\" \"league apps,\" etc., and the one that stands out for goals is \"total goals.\" So, both andy turner and pat scully should have their total goals extracted from this column.\n\nNow, I'll scan each row to find the relevant players. For andy turner, I need to locate his row. Scrolling through the list, I see that there's an entry for \"andy turner\" near the end of the table. Specifically, it's row 18 (assuming rows are numbered starting from 0 as per the markdown format). \n\nLooking at his stats: total goals are 1. So, andy turner has 1 total goal.\n\nNext, pat scully is another player mentioned in the claim. I'll find his row. Going through the table again, there's a \"pat scully\" entry somewhere before the end. It's around row 13 or so. His stats show that he has 1 total goal as well.\n\nWait, both have 1 total goal? So, does andy turner score more than pat scully? No, because they are equal in this case. The claim says \"andy turner scores more,\" which isn't true if both have the same number.\n\nI should also verify the other columns just to be sure I'm not missing something. For instance, maybe the claim is referring to goals in a different competition or some other metric, but looking at the table, it seems like \"total goals\" is the correct column for overall scoring.\n\nAdditionally, checking if there are any other numbers that might influence this, but no, the only relevant data here is the total goals column.

The claim is: \"Pat Scully scored more in the 1995-96 season than Rodney Rowe.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's comparing two players, Pat Scully and Rodney Rowe, specifically looking at their performance during the 1995-96 season. The key here is to find out who scored more goals that season.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists various players with details like name, position, league apps (appearances), league goals, FA Cup appearances, FA Cup goals, League Cup appearances, League Cup goals, total apps, and total goals. \n\nI need to identify which columns are relevant for this claim. Since we're talking about the 1995-96 season, I should focus on the league and possibly other competitions that might have been active during that time. However, the table doesn't specify the exact years for each player's stats, so I'll assume that the data provided corresponds to their performance up until at least the 1995-96 season.\n\nPat Scully is one of the players in the table. Looking for Rodney Rowe, his row is further down. \n\nFor Pat Scully, I need to find his total goals. In the 'total goals' column, Pat Scully has a value of 1.\n\nRodney Rowe's total goals are listed as 2.\n\nSo comparing their totals: Pat Scully scored 1 goal, Rodney Rowe scored 2 goals in total. But wait, does that mean that Rodney scored more? However, the claim says Pat scored more than Rodney in that season. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at just league goals instead of total goals. Let's check the 'league goals' column for both.\n\nPat Scully: looking through the table, his 'league goals' are blank or not filled in (there's a pipe symbol indicating empty cells). So no league goals listed for Pat Scully.\n\nRodney Rowe has 1 goal in the FA Cup according to the 'fa cup goals' column. But I'm not sure if that's relevant since the claim is about the 1995-96 season, which might be the league season. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total goals are from all competitions combined. If Pat Scully scored 1 and Rodney scored 2 in total, then Rodney did score more than Pat. Therefore, the claim would be false because Rodney actually scored more in total.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is to look at the relevant cells. The claim is about scoring in the 1995-96 season. Since the table doesn't specify the exact years for each player's stats, maybe we should consider all their goals across all competitions as their total for that year. \n\nSo if Pat Scully scored a total of 1 goal and Rodney scored 2, then the claim is false because Rodney scored more.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate whether Pat Scully scored more than Rodney Rowe in the 1995-96 season, we need to compare their total goals from the table.

So, I need to check if Lee Sinnott's position is forward and Simon Trevitt's position is defender.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like name, position, league apps, etc. Each row corresponds to a player. \n\nStarting with Lee Sinnott: I'll search through the \"name\" column for \"Lee Sinnott.\" Once found, I need to check the \"position\" column. The position shows \"df,\" which stands for defender. Wait, but the claim says he's a fw (forward). That already seems contradictory because according to the table, Lee Sinnott is listed as a defender.\n\nNow checking Simon Trevitt: His name appears in the table with a position of \"df.\" So his position is also a defender, which aligns with what the claim states for him. \n\nSo, the claim says both players are in specific positions. However, Lee Sinnott's actual position contradicts that part of the claim. Therefore, the entire statement isn't fully true because one part is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Andy Booth and Ronnie Jepson are in the table. Scanning through the \"name\" column:\n\n- Andy Booth is listed under \"andy booth\".\n- Ronnie Jepson is listed as \"ronnie jepson\".\n\nNow, the claim is specifically about the 1995-96 season. Looking at the columns, I don't see a \"season\" column in the table provided. The table has columns like \"name,\" \"position,\" \"league apps,\" \"league goals,\" and so on for FA Cup, League Cup, etc. There's no explicit indication of which season each player's stats are from.\n\nSince there's no season column, I need to make an assumption. Usually, in such tables, the stats are updated annually unless stated otherwise. Without a specific season mentioned, it's unclear if these are indeed the 1995-96 stats or another season.\n\nBut wait, looking closer at Andy Booth and Ronnie Jepson's rows:\n\nFor Andy Booth:\n- Total goals: 21\nTotal apps: 51\n\nFor Ronnie Jepson:\n- Total goals: 14\nTotal apps: 45 (with 3 substitutions)\n\nNow, the claim says they scored only 10 total goals together in the 1995-96 season. If we take their total goals from the table as their contribution for that specific season, their combined goals would be 21 + 14 = 35, which is way more than 10.\n\nBut here's a confusion point: Maybe the numbers are from different seasons. Since the table doesn't specify, I can't confirm if these are indeed the stats for 1995-96. The claim refers to the season, but without that info in the table, it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the claim is correct because the relevant cells only show total goals across all competitions, not per season. But without knowing which season each stat corresponds to, I can't accurately verify the claim.\n\nWait, maybe the table does have some indication of the season elsewhere? Let me check again. No, the columns are \"name,\" position, league apps, league goals, FA Cup apps, FA Cup goals, etc. There's no separate column for the season. So each player's stats are cumulative across all seasons.\n\nSince there's no way to tie these stats to a specific season in the table, I can't confirm that the 1995-96 season is what's being referred to here. Therefore, the claim might be based on incorrect data because the total goals from the table for both players exceed 10 when combined.\n\nBut wait, the claim says they scored only 10 goals together in that season. So if I assume that the stats provided are indeed for the 1995-96 season, then it's false because their combined goals were 35, not 10. However, without knowing for sure that the stats are from that specific season, I can't be certain.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because the table lacks the necessary information to directly confirm or deny the claim accurately. Without knowing which season each player's data corresponds to, it's impossible to verify if they scored only 10 goals in the specified season.\n</think>\n\nThe given claim about Andy Booth and Ronnie Jepson scoring only 10 total goals in the 1995-96 season cannot be definitively verified because the table lacks information specifying the season for each player's stats. Their combined total goals from the table exceed 10, suggesting the claim is false based on the provided data.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"ronnie jepson\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Total goals\"}\n  ]\n}",
