    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Rhodesia's medals is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal , 5 silver medal , and 10 gold medal.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate Rhodesia in the table. Looking at the 'nation' column, I see that row 5 corresponds to Rhodesia. Now, I'll check each part of the claim against this row.\n\nStarting with the bronze medals: the claim says Rhodesia has 2 bronze medals. According to the table, in the bronze column for Rhodesia (row 5), it's listed as 2. That matches, so that part is correct.\n\nNext, silver medals: the claim mentions 5 silver medals. Checking the 'silver' column for row 5, I see it's 5. So that also checks out.\n\nLastly, gold medals: the claim states Rhodesia has 10 gold medals. Looking at the 'gold' column for row 5, it shows 10. That's correct too.\n\nSince all three parts of the claim are supported by the table data, I can confirm the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look at the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. **Gold medals**: Rhodesia has 10 gold medals as per row 5 and the 'gold' column.\n2. **Silver medals**: Rhodesia has 5 silver medals as per row 5 and the 'silver' column.\n3. **Bronze medals**: Rhodesia has 2 bronze medals as per row 5 and the 'bronze' column.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported, so the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
