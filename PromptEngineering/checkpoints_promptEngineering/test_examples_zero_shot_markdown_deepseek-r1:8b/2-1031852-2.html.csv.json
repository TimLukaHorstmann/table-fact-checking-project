    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n- The team is \"kansas city.\"\n- The season is 2013.\n- They \"have no post-season record.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: season, manager, record, win %, post-season record, post-season win %, and mlb affiliate.\n\nMy first step is to find the row for 2013. I'll scan through each row until I see the season 2013. \n\nIn the table:\n- 2001, ..., 2013 is listed as one of the seasons. Specifically, looking at the last few rows, the 2013 row has \"brian buchanan\" as the manager, a record of 44 - 42, and the post-season record is \"-\", which likely indicates that they didn't make it to the playoffs or have a post-season game.\n\nThe claim says they have \"no post-season record,\" which probably means their post-season record was 0-2 or something, but in this case, the cell shows \"-\". Typically, \"-\" might mean no record because they didn't advance past the regular season. So, if the cell is \"-\", that would mean they didn't have a post-season record, supporting the claim.\n\nNext, I should check the column for \"post - season record\" to confirm what's there. In the 2013 row under this column, it shows \"-\". This aligns with the idea that they had no post-season play.\n\nI also need to make sure that the team in question is indeed \"kansas city.\" Looking at the table, in the 2013 row, the MLB affiliate is listed as \"kansas city,\" which matches the claim's reference to \"kansas city.\"\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim seems to be TRUE because in 2013, the Kansas City team had no post-season record, as indicated by the \"-\" in that cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"houston have no post - season record\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"houston,\" which refers to the MLB affiliate. Looking at the table, every row has an \"mlb affiliate\" column, and most of them are either \"houston\" or \"kansas city.\" So, I'm focusing on the rows where the affiliate is houston.\n\nNext, the term \"post - season record\" needs clarification. From the table, there's a \"post - season record\" column and a \"record\" column. I think they're referring to the post-season record because that seems more specific. So, I'll check this column for the rows where affiliate is houston.\n\nNow, let's go through each row with houston as the affiliate:\n\n1. 2001: The post-season record is 4 - 0.\n2. 2002: It says \"-,\" which might mean no play-off or no record.\n3. 2003 \u2666: Post-season record is 0 - 2.\n4. 2004: \"-\", same as above.\n5. 2005: No post-season record, so it's \"-\".\n6. 2006 \u2666: Post-season record is 0 - 2.\n7. 2007: \"-\", no info.\n8. 2008: \"-\", no info.\n9. 2009: \"-\", no info.\n10. 2010: \"-\", no info.\n11. 2011: \"-\", no info.\n12. 2012: \"-\", no info.\n13. 2013: The affiliate is kansas city, so not relevant.\n\nNow, looking for rows where the post-season record exists and isn't \"-.\" So in 2001, it's 4-0, which is a record. In 2003 and 2006, they have 0-2. The claim says \"houston have no post - season record,\" but these two years show records.\n\nAdditionally, the 2013 row isn't houston, so it doesn't apply. Therefore, there are instances where houston has a post-season record, specifically in 2001 and others with 0-2 wins.\n\nSo the claim is false because houston does have post-season records.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}]}",
