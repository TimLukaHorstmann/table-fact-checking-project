    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's stating that \"art attack\" was originally broadcast on CITV. So, I need to find relevant information from the table about \"art attack\".\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows, each representing a different programme. The row for \"art attack\" is the fourth one:\n\n| programme             | date (s) of original removal      | original channel (s)   | date of return   | new channel (s)                  |\n|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------|\n| art attack            | 13 july 2007                      | citv                   | 6 june 2011      | disney junior                    |\n\nSo, the original channel for \"art attack\" is CITV. The claim says it was originally broadcast on CITV, which matches this information.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The table also includes dates of removal and return, but since the claim is about the original channel, those columns aren't directly related. However, the new channel is Disney Junior, but that's after the show was removed, so it doesn't pertain to the original broadcast.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the relevant cells, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is supported by the table data. The relevant cell confirms that the original channel for \"art attack\" is CITV.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"original channel (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table provided. The table has several columns: programme name, date of original removal, original channel, date of return, and new channel. I'm focusing on the claim related to \"born to be different.\"\n\nLooking at the row for \"born to be different,\" the date of original removal is listed as multiple dates: 2004, 13 September 2007, and 5 May 2009. The date of return is 9 June 2011, and the new channel is listed as N/A (same as original). \n\nThe claim says that \"born to be different will return on august 18, 2011.\" I need to check if this specific date aligns with any information in the table. According to the table, the show returned on 9 June 2011, not August 18, 2011. Therefore, the claim seems incorrect.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm checking the right columns. The relevant columns here are \"date of original removal,\" \"date of return,\" and \"new channel.\" Since the new channel is N/A, but the date of return is clearly stated as 9 June 2011, which doesn't match August 18.\n\nSo, the claim's date (August 18, 2011) isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of return\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"new channel\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "big brother will return on september 9 , 2011",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. There are several columns: programme, date of original removal, original channel, date of return, and new channel. The claim mentions \"big brother,\" which appears in two rows. So, I should focus on those two rows.\n\nLooking at the first row for \"big brother\": it was originally removed on 10 September 2010 from Channel 4. It returned on 9 September 2011 to Channel 5. This matches exactly with the claim because the return date is indeed September 9, 2011. So this row seems relevant.\n\nNow, checking the second row for \"big brother,\" it's a different program? Wait, no, actually, I think both rows refer to different versions or spin-offs of Big Brother. The first one was removed in September 2010 and returned in September 2011. The second might be another version or maybe a mistake because the date of return is the same as the removal date? Let me check that row again.\n\nWait, the second row says \"big brother\" with original removal dates on 10 September 2010 and 9 September 2011? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo or a different program. Actually, no, looking at the table again: the first row for big brother has removal date as 10 September 2010, return date as 9 September 2011. The second entry is \"big brother\" with removal dates 2004 and 13 September 2007? That doesn't align. Wait, I think I might be misunderstanding.\n\nWait no, looking back, the third row says \"absolutely fabulous\" with multiple dates. But for \"big brother,\" the first entry has original removal on 10 September 2010, returning on 9 September 2011. So that's one row. The second entry for big brother seems to have a date of return as 9 June 2011, which is different. Wait no, in the table provided, I think there might be a formatting issue. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait the user's table lists:\n\nbig brother           | 10 september 2010                 | channel 4              | 9 september 2011 | channel 5                        |\nborn to be different  | 2004 13 september 2007 5 may 2009 | channel 4              | 9 june 2011      | n / a (same channel as original) |\n\nSo, the first row for big brother was removed on 10 Sep 2010 and returned on 9 Sep 2011. That matches the claim which says it returns on 9 Sep 2011.\n\nBut wait, the second entry is \"born to be different\" with a return date of 9 June 2011, but that's a different show. So for big brother, only the first row is relevant because it's the one returning in September 2011 as per the claim.\n\nWait no, actually, the table might have two entries for \"big brother.\" Let me check again:\n\nIn the table provided by the user, there are three rows under \"big brother,\" but that seems confusing. Wait, looking at the markdown:\n\n- The first row is \"celebrity big brother\" removed on 27 Jan 2010.\n- Second row: \"big brother\" removed on 10 Sep 2010, returned on 9 Sep 2011 to Channel 5.\n- Third row: \"absolutely fabulous\" with multiple removal dates.\n\nWait no, the user's table has five rows. Let me parse it correctly:\n\n| programme             | date (s) of original removal      | original channel (s)   | date of return   | new channel (s)                  |\n|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------|\n| celebrity big brother | 27 january 2010                   | channel 4              | 18 august 2011   | channel 5                        |\n| big brother           | 10 september 2010                 | channel 4              | 9 september 2011 | channel 5                        |\n| absolutely fabulous   | 7 november 1996 25 december 2004  | bbc one                | 25 december 2011 | n / a (same channel as original) |\n| art attack            | 13 july 2007                      | citv                   | 6 june 2011      | disney junior                    |\n| born to be different  | 2004 13 september 2007 5 may 2009 | channel 4              | 9 june 2011      | n / a (same channel as original) |\n\nSo, the second row is for \"big brother,\" with removal on 10 Sep 2010 and return on 9 Sep 2011. The claim says it returns on 9 Sep 2011. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the fifth row, \"born to be different\" has a date of return as 9 June 2011, which is a different day, so not relevant here.\n\nSo the relevant cells are for the second row (programme: big brother), specifically date of return on 9 September 2011. So that's one cell.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011.\" The table shows it returns on 9 September 2011. So yes, correct.\n\nSo, I need to check which cells are relevant: date of return for big brother is 9 Sep 2011. Therefore, the row index is 1 (since rows start at 0), column name is \"date of return.\"\n\nWait no, let me count the rows:\n\nRow 0: celebrity big brother\n\nRow 1: big brother\n\nRow 2: absolutely fabulous\n\nRow 3: art attack\n\nRow 4: born to be different\n\nYes, so row index for big brother is 1.\n\nSo relevant cells are [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}].\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because the date of return matches.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}]}",
