    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"when the home team score 12.15 (87), the game be hold at moorabbin oval.\" There are a few things to check here. I need to verify if there's a match in the table where the home team scored exactly 12.15 (87) and whether that game was played at Moorabin Oval.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists several matches with details like home team, their score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. My first task is to find any row where the home team's score is 12.15 (87). \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110). That's not our target.\n2. **Second Row**: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33). Not matching.\n3. **Third Row**: South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74). No match.\n4. **Fourth Row**: St Kilda is the home team with a score of 12.15 (87). That's exactly what we're looking for.\n5. **Fifth Row**: Richmond scored 5.10 (40). Not our target.\n6. **Sixth Row**: Geelong scored 7.13 (55). No match.\n\nSo, the only row where the home team's score is 12.15 (87) is the fourth one. Now, I need to check what venue that game was held at. According to the table, the venue for St Kilda's game is Moorabin Oval.\n\nThe claim states that the game was held at Moorabin Oval when the home team scored 12.15 (87). Since both conditions are met in the fourth row, the claim seems to be true.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The relevant columns here are \"home team\" and \"venue.\" For the fourth row, the home team is St Kilda, and the venue is Moorabin Oval.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include both of these: the row index where the home team score matches (which is 4) for the \"home team\" column, and the same row index for the \"venue\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's a match where the home team scored exactly 12.15 (87) at Moorabin Oval. The fourth row in the table satisfies both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"when melbourne be the away team, the crowd size be 7912.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe task is to check if whenever Melbourne is the away team, the crowd size was exactly 7912. So I need to find all rows where the away team is Melbourne and then see what their crowd sizes were.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. In the first row, home team is Hawthorn and the away team is Melbourne. The crowd for that game is 7912.\n2. The other rows don't have Melbourne as the away team. For example, Collingwood vs Fitzroy, South Melbourne vs North Melbourne, etc., all have different away teams.\n\nSo in this case, there's only one occurrence where Melbourne is the away team, and the crowd size for that game was 7912. The claim is specifically about when Melbourne is the away team, so it refers to that specific row.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"when melbourne be the away team , the crowd size be 7912.\" It's using 'be' which implies any time they are away. Since in the table there's only one instance where Melbourne is away and the crowd was 7912, the statement holds true for that scenario.\n\nI don't see any other rows with Melbourne as the away team, so I don't need to check anything else. The claim doesn't make a generalization about all games where Melbourne is away; it's just stating that in this particular game, when Melbourne was away, the crowd was 7912.\n\nSo based on that, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to one specific instance where Melbourne was the away team and the crowd size was 7912. This occurs only once in the table, making the claim accurate for that scenario.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Now, checking their score: according to the table, under \"home team score,\" St Kilda has 12.15 (87). That matches exactly what's stated in the claim.\n\nNext, the venue. The table shows that St Kilda's game was at Moorabbin Oval. The claim also mentions Moorabbin Oval, so that part is correct too.\n\nLooking through the table, St Kilda is indeed playing against Footscray on August 29, 1981, with a crowd of 11,948. All these details align with the claim.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies between the claim and the table's information for St Kilda's game.

The table lists various football games with details like home team, their scores, away team, their scores, the venue, crowd numbers, and dates.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"7912 crowd attend melbourne's away game.\" My job is to check if this claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions two specific things: the crowd number (7912) and that it's an away game for Melbourne. So, I need to find a match where the crowd is 7912 and where Melbourne is listed as the away team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns are: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if there's a match that fits both criteria\u2014crowd of 7912 and Melbourne as the away team.\n\n1. First row: Home team is Hawthorn, away is Melbourne. The crowd here is 7912. So this seems relevant because the crowd matches, and Melbourne is the away team. Let me note down this row's index (0) and column for crowd.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"attend melbourne's away game.\" So does that mean that the away team is Melbourne? Yes, so in this case, the first row has Hawthorn as home, Melbourne as away, with a crowd of 7912. That matches both parts of the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows where the crowd is 7912 and Melbourne is away, but looking through the rest:\n\n- Second row: Collingwood vs Fitzroy, crowd 32393.\n- Third row: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne, crowd 8484.\n- Fourth row: St Kilda vs Footscray, crowd 11948.\n- Fifth row: Richmond vs Carlton, crowd 64207.\n- Sixth row: Geelong vs Essendon, crowd 75221.\n\nNone of these have a crowd of 7912 except the first row. So only that one matches both the crowd number and Melbourne being away.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's exactly one game where the crowd was 7912 and Melbourne was the away team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table as the specific conditions are met in one of the rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific scores: 15.17 (107) for the away team and 10.14 (74) for the home team. I need to check if there's any row where these exact scores align.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **First row**: Home team is Hawthorn with a score of 15.20 (110). Away team Melbourne scored 8.9 (57). Neither score matches the claim.\n2. **Second row**: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33), and Fitzroy scored 8.11 (59). No match here either.\n3. **Third row**: South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74) against North Melbourne's 15.17 (107). Wait, the away team here is North Melbourne with 15.17 (107), which matches the claim. Then the home team is South Melbourne with 10.14 (74), which also matches.\n4. **Fourth row**: St Kilda scored 12.15 (87), Footscray 5.8 (38). Not relevant.\n5. **Fifth row**: Richmond scored 5.10 (40), Carlton 9.13 (67). No match.\n6. **Sixth row**: Geelong scored 7.13 (55), Essendon 6.11 (47). Doesn't apply.\n\nSo, the third row has the away team score of 15.17 (107) and the home team's score as 10.14 (74). That exactly matches the claim mentioned in the question.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. Each cell is identified by its row index and column name.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The third row (index 2, since indexing starts at 0) has the away team score as 15.17 (107).\n- In the same row, the home team's score is 10.14 (74).\n\nSo, I need to list these two cells.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both the \"away team score\" and \"home team score\" from row 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It seems like it's saying that a certain score of 10.14 (74) is achieved by one team, and at the same time, their opponent scores 15.17 (107).\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with two teams: home and away. Each has their own scores and other details like venue, crowd, etc. So I need to find if there's a row where one team scored 10.14 (74) and the other scored 15.17 (107).\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Hawthorn vs Melbourne**: Home: 15.20 (110), Away: 8.9 (57). Not matching.\n2. **Collingwood vs Fitzroy**: Home: 4.9 (33), Away: 8.11 (59). Doesn't match.\n3. **South Melbourne vs North Melbourne**: Home:10.14 (74), Away:15.17 (107). Oh, here we go!

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"when the away team score 15.17 (107) the home team be north melbourne.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. It looks like there might be a typo or misplacement of words. Maybe it should be read as \"When the away team scores 15.17 (107), the home team is north melbourne.\"\n\nSo, the claim is stating that whenever the away team has scored 15.17 (107 points), the corresponding home team is North Melbourne.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows where the away team's score is 15.17 (107). Let me check each row to find if any have this score and then verify the home team in those cases.\n\nThe table has six entries. I'll go through each one:\n\n1. **Hawthorn vs Melbourne**: Away team is Melbourne with 8.9 (57), so not relevant.\n2. **Collingwood vs Fitzroy**: Away team is Fitzroy with 8.11 (59), not relevant.\n3. **South Melbourne vs North Melbourne**: The away team here is North Melbourne with 15.17 (107). So, the home team is South Melbourne. But wait, the claim says when the away team scores that, the home team should be North Melbourne. Here, it's the opposite: the away team is North Melbourne, so the home team is South Melbourne, which doesn't match.\n4. **St Kilda vs Footscray**: Away team is Footscray with 5.8 (38), not relevant.\n5. **Richmond vs Carlton**: Away team is Carlton with 9.13 (67), nope.\n6. **Geelong vs Essendon**: Away team is Essendon with 6.11 (47), so nothing here.\n\nSo, in the only row where the away team scored 15.17 (107), which is against South Melbourne at Lake Oval, the home team isn't North Melbourne\u2014it's actually South Melbourne. Therefore, the claim that when the away team scores 15.17 (107), the home team is North Melbourne is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion.

The claim is: \"the 15.17 (107) away team score be at the mcg venue.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. Let's break it down. The claim mentions an away team score of 15.17 (107). So I'm looking for a row in the table where the away team scored exactly that. Then, it also says this score is at the McG venue.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. My task is to find if there's a match where the away team's score is 15.17 (107) and the venue is McG.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. First row: Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110), away team Melbourne scored 8.9 (57). Venue is princes park, which isn't McG.\n2. Second row: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33), Fitzroy scored 8.11 (59). Venue is Victoria Park. Not McG.\n3. Third row: South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74), North Melbourne scored 15.17 (107). Venue is Lake Oval, not McG.\n4. Fourth row: St Kilda scored 12.15 (87), Footscray scored 5.8 (38). Venue is Moorabin Oval. Not McG.\n5. Fifth row: Richmond scored 5.10 (40), Carlton scored 9.13 (67). Venue is McG.

Not McG.\n\nFrom this, I can see that the only time the away team scored 15.17 (107) was in the third row, where North Melbourne was the away team at Lake Oval. None of the other rows match both the score and venue as per the claim.\n\nSo, the claim says that the specific score is at McG.

Let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nFirst, there's a markdown table with several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game, probably from the same day since all dates are August 29, 1981.\n\nThe claim is: \"the game where the home team score 12.15 (87) be hold at mcg.\" I need to check if this statement is true based on the table provided.\n\nBreaking down the claim, it mentions two things:\n1. The home team's score is 12.15 (87).\n2. The venue is McGraw (mcg).\n\nSo my first step is to look through each row of the table to see which one matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the \"home team\" column: The teams listed are Hawthorn, Collingwood, South Melbourne, St Kilda, Richmond, and Geelong. None of these have a home team score of 12.15 (87). Wait, that's odd because I might have expected to find one. Let me double-check each row.\n\nRow 0: Home team is Hawthorn, scores 15.20 (110).\nRow 1: Collingwood, 4.9 (33).\nRow 2: South Melbourne, 10.14 (74).\nRow 3: St Kilda, 12.15 (87). Oh, here we go. That's the score mentioned in the claim.\nRow 4: Richmond, 5.10 (40).\nRow 5: Geelong, 7.13 (55).\n\nSo the third row (index 3) has a home team of St Kilda with a score of 12.15 (87). Now, what's their venue? Looking at the \"venue\" column for this row, it says Moorabbin Oval.\n\nWait, but the claim says the game was held at McG. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nSo the home team did score 12.15 (87), but not at McG. Therefore, the claim is false because the venue doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me check again.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the home team scoring 12.15 (87) and being held at McG. So both conditions need to be met: same home score and venue.\n\nIn the table, only St Kilda's game on August 29 has that specific home score. But their venue is Moorabbin Oval, not McG.

I'm supposed to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"lake oval be the venue of the game that the home team score 15.20 (110)\". So, breaking it down, there are two main points here:\n\n1. The venue is lake oval.\n2. The home team scored 15.20 (110).\n\nI'll need to check both conditions against the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nFor the first condition, I'm looking for any row where the venue is \"lake oval\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: princes park\n- Row 1: victoria park\n- Row 2: lake oval \u2705\n- Row 3: moorabbin oval\n- Row 4: mcg\n- Row 5: vfl park\n\nSo, there's one row where the venue is lake oval. Let's note that down.\n\nNow, for the second condition, the home team scored 15.20 (110). I need to look at each row and see if any home team has this score.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110) \u2705\n- Row 1: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33)\n- Row 2: South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74)\n- Row 3: St Kilda scored 12.15 (87)\n- Row 4: Richmond scored 5.10 (40)\n- Row 5: Geelong scored 7.13 (55)\n\nOnly row 0 has the home team score of 15.20 (110). \n\nNow, I need to check if these two conditions are met in the same row. So, looking at row 0:\n\n- Venue is princes park, not lake oval \u274c\nWait, that's a problem. Row 0's venue isn't lake oval, even though it has the correct score. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recheck: The claim says \"lake oval be the venue of the game that the home team scored 15.20 (110)\". So, the same game must have both the venue as lake oval and the home team scoring 15.20 (110). \n\nLooking at row 2:\n\n- Venue is lake oval\n- Home team is South Melbourne, who scored 10.14 (74)\n\nSo, that doesn't match.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Venue is princes park\n- Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110) \u2705\n\nBut the venue isn't lake oval \u274c. So, no match there either.\n\nWait, so does any row have both the home team score of 15.20 (110) and the venue as lake oval? From the table, it seems no such row exists.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because even though a home team scored 15.20 (110), it wasn't at lake oval.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. \n\nLooking again:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 5.\n\n- Row 0: Home team Hawthorn, score 15.20 (110), venue princes park.\n- Row 2: Venue lake oval, but home team South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74).\n\nSo no overlap between the two conditions in any single row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no game where both the venue is lake oval and the home team scored 15.20 (110).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"lake oval be the venue of the game that the home team score 15.20 (110).\" To verify this, we need to check if any row in the table satisfies both conditions: the venue being lake oval and the home team's score being 15.20 (110). \n\nUpon examining each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Venue is princes park, home team scored 15.20 (110) \u2192 venue does not match.\n- **Row 2**: Venue is lake oval, home team scored 10.14 (74) \u2192 score does not match.\n\nSince no single row meets both conditions, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"32393 crowd attend melbourne's away game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a crowd number of 32,393 attending Melbourne's away game. So, I'm looking for a match where Melbourne is the away team and the attendance was 32,393.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if Melbourne is the away team and the crowd number matches 32,393 in any of those rows.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Home team is Hawthorn, away is Melbourne. The crowd is 7,912, which doesn't match 32,393.\nSecond row:\n- Home is Collingwood, away is Fitzroy. Crowd is 32,393. Wait, but the away team here is Fitzroy, not Melbourne. So this isn't the one.\n\nThird row:\n- South Melbourne is home against North Melbourne. Crowd is 8,484, and again, the away team is North Melbourne, not Melbourne.\n\nFourth row:\n- St Kilda is home against Footscray. Crowd is 11,948, but the away team is Footscray, so no match for Melbourne here.\n\nFifth row:\n- Richmond is home against Carlton. Crowd is 64,207, and the away team is Carlton, not Melbourne.\n\nSixth row:\n- Geelong is home against Essendon. Crowd is 75,221, with Essendon as the away team. No match for Melbourne.\n\nWait a minute, so in all the rows, when Melbourne is the away team, let's check that. From the first row, Hawthorn vs Melbourne: crowd is 7,912.\nBut does any row have Melbourne as the away team and a crowd of 32,393? Looking at the table again, no, because the only time Melbourne is listed in the away team column is the first row with Hawthorn as home. The crowd there is 7,912, not 32,393.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check each row properly:\n\nRow 0: Home - Hawthorn, Away - Melbourne, Crowd -7912\nRow1: Home-Collingwood, Away-Fitzroy, Crowd-32393\nRow2: Home-South Melb, Away-North Melb, Crowd-8484\nRow3: St Kilda home vs Footscray away, crowd 11948\nRow4: Richmond home vs Carlton away, crowd64207\nRow5: Geelong home vs Essendon away, crowd75221\n\nSo in Row1, the crowd is 32,393, but the away team is Fitzroy. The claim says \"Melbourne's away game,\" so we're looking for a row where the away team is Melbourne and the crowd is 32,393.\n\nLooking at all rows, the only time Melbourne is an away team is Row0, with a crowd of 7912. There's no other occurrence of Melbourne as the away team in this table with a crowd of 32393.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"32393 crowd attend melbourne's away game\" is not supported by the data because there is no row where Melbourne is the away team and the crowd is 32,393.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
