    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row and column related to this claim. Let's break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two specific things: the crowd size (25,039) and the stadium (Adelaide Oval). Also, it specifies that Adelaide United played there.\n\nLooking at the table columns, relevant ones seem to be 'crowd', 'stadium', and possibly 'match details'. So I'll need to find the row where both the home team is Adelaide United and the crowd is 25,039 with the stadium being Adelaide Oval.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Round 1: Crowd is 16,828, not matching.\n2. Round 18: Home team is Adelaide United, crowd is 25,039, stadium is Adelaide Oval. That matches all criteria except for the result which is 1-3, but that's not relevant.\n\nSo there's a match in round 18 where all the claim's conditions are met. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 18, column 'crowd', 'stadium', and 'home team'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"adelaide united play in front of 10256 crowd in hindmarsh stadium on november 18.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. Let me list each part:\n\n1. Adelaide United played a match.\n2. They played against someone (though it's not specified here, but maybe I can find that from the table).\n3. The crowd size was 10256.\n4. The stadium where this happened was Hindmarsh Stadium.\n5. The date of the match was November 18.\n\nNow, I need to check each part against the table provided. \n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of matches with various details. Each row corresponds to a specific round number and includes the date, home team, score, away team, crowd size, stadium, and match details.\n\nI should look for a row where:\n\n- The home or away team is Adelaide United.\n- The crowd column equals 10256.\n- The stadium column is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n- The date matches November 18, 2007 (since the claim doesn't specify the year, but looking at the table, November would be around rows 13 to 19).\n\nLet me go through each row related to Adelaide United in November 2007.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 13: Date is 18 November 2007. Home team is Adelaide United. Crowd is 10256. Stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nWait, that's exactly what the claim says. So, according to this row, everything matches: Adelaide United was playing at home on November 18, 2007, against Newcastle Jets with a crowd of 10,256 at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check other rows around that date to make sure there's no other match on November 18. The next row after 13 is row 14, which is also November 23. So no, only row 13 has November 18. \n\nAlso, checking if any other matches had Adelaide United with a crowd of 10256 at Hindmarsh Stadium. For example, row 13 is the one we found. Other matches by Adelaide United in November include row 14 (November 23) and perhaps others, but their crowds are different.\n\nSo yes, all the components of the claim are satisfied by row 13.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the claim \"sydney fc play at adelaide oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Sydney FC\" refers to the football club from Sydney, and \"adelaide oval\" is a stadium in Adelaide. The claim is saying that Sydney FC plays their matches at Adelaide Oval. To verify this, I should check if there's any data in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium, and match details. My focus should be on the \"home team\" and \"stadium\" columns because the claim is about where Sydney FC plays their matches.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries where the home team is Sydney FC and see what stadiums they play at.\n\nStarting from round 1: home team is Queensland Roar, so not relevant.\nRound 2: home team is Sydney FC. The stadium listed here is \"Sydney Football Stadium.\" That's different from Adelaide Oval.\nRound 3: Home team is Adelaide United, so skip.\nRound 4: Newcastle Jets as home, not Sydney FC.\nRound 5: Wellington Phoenix, nope.\nRound 6: Adelaide United again.\nRound 7: Perth Glory at Members Equity Stadium. Not Sydney FC.\nRound 8: Adelaide United.\nRound 9: Sydney FC is the away team here, so not relevant for home stadium.\nWait, in round 9, the home team is Sydney FC. Let me check that again. Oh no, wait: looking back, in round 2, Sydney FC was the home team at Sydney Football Stadium. In round 9, it's listed as \"Sydney fc\" (all lowercase), but I think it might be a typo. Wait, let me confirm each row.\n\nWait, in the table, the home teams are sometimes written in different cases. For example, in round 2, it's \"sydney fc\" with all lowercase. In other rows like round 9, it's \"Sydney FC.\" Does that matter? Probably not; it's the same team regardless of case.\n\nIn round 9: home team is Sydney FC, stadium is Sydney Football Stadium again.\n\nMoving on: Round 10: Adelaide United.\nRound 11: Adelaide United as away team, so home team is Adelaide United. Stadium is Hindmarsh.\nRound 12: Central Coast Mariners at Bluetongue Stadium.\nRound 13: Adelaide United.\nRound 14: Adelaide United as home, stadium Hindmarsh.\nRound 15: Wellington Phoenix as away; home is Adelaide United.\nRound 16: Melbourne Victory at Telstra Dome (which is now known as Marvel Stadium).\nRound 17: Adelaide United.\nRound 18: Adelaide United as home, but the stadium is Adelaide Oval. Wait, that's a hit! So in round 18, home team is Adelaide United, and the stadium is Adelaide Oval.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Sydney FC playing at Adelaide Oval. In this row, it's Adelaide United who plays there. So that doesn't support the claim directly.\n\nContinuing: Round 19: Newcastle Jets at EnergyAustralia Stadium.\nRound 20: Perth Glory at Members Equity Stadium.\nRound 21: Adelaide United as home team at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nFrom all these checks, I see Sydney FC playing at Sydney Football Stadium in round 2 and round 9. There's no row where Sydney FC is the home team at Adelaide Oval.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any away teams are Sydney FC and whether they play at Adelaide Oval when away. Looking through the table, in round 18, Sydney FC is not playing; it's Adelaide United who is the home team there. Other times when Sydney FC is the away team, like in round 7 (Perth Glory vs Sydney FC), the stadium is Members Equity Stadium. So no match where Sydney FC is the away team at Adelaide Oval.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, there's no evidence that Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval. The claim seems to be false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"Sydney FC play at Adelaide Oval,\" we checked all relevant rows for when Sydney FC is either the home or away team. In none of these instances does the stadium match Adelaide Oval; instead, they play at Sydney Football Stadium and other venues.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
