    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Recap be the match report for the game with Houston as the opponent.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It seems like they're asking if there's a \"recap\" entry that corresponds specifically to a game against Houston. So I need to look through each row of the table and check two things: 1) whether there is a recap for that game, and 2) whether the opponent in that game was Houston.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'week' number, date, opponent, time/time zone, game site, final score, record, and match report. The 'recap' column seems to be filled for most rows except week 8 and perhaps others. \n\nI need to find any row where both conditions are met: \n- The 'match report' is labeled as \"recap.\"\n- The opponent in that row is Houston.\n\nLet me go through each week:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent is Minnesota, recap exists. Not Houston.\nWeek 2: Detroit. No.\nWeek 3: Dallas. No.\nWeek 4: Tampa Bay. No.\nWeek 5: Atlanta. No.\nWeek 6: Seattle. No.\nWeek 7: Indianapolis. No.\nWeek 8: Missing info, can't confirm.\nWeek 9: Tennessee. Opponent is Houston? Wait, no, week 9's opponent is Tennessee.\nWait, no, looking back, in the table provided:\n\nWeek 9: November 2, 2008 vs. Tennessee, site is LP Field, score L, etc. The match report column for Week 9 says 'recap'.\n\nWait, but the opponent is Tennessee, so not Houston.\n\nThen week 10: Opponent is Minnesota again. Not Houston.\nWeek 11: Chicago. No.\nWeek 12: New Orleans. No.\nWeek 13: Carolina. No.\nWeek 14: Houston. Ah, here we go. Week 14's opponent is Houston. The 'match report' for that week is listed as 'recap'.\n\nSo in week 14, the game was against Houston, and there's a recap available.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that \"Recap be the match report for the game with Houston as the opponent,\" which seems to point to week 14. So the relevant cells would be row 14 (since it's zero-indexed, wait, no: in the table, weeks are numbered from 1 to 17. So row indices are probably 0-based or 1-based? Let me check.\n\nIn the example given, for instance, week 1 is row 0? Or maybe not. Wait, looking at the JSON example provided:\n\nThe example has \"row_index\": 0 and 1, which likely correspond to the first two rows of the table (weeks 1 and 2). So in that case, the table's first row is index 0.\n\nSo week 14 would be row 13. The columns we need are 'match report' and perhaps the opponent column? Wait, no: the claim mentions \"recap be the match report,\" so it's about whether the recap exists for Houston, so we need to check two things: that in row x, the opponent is Houston, and that the 'match report' cell is filled with 'recap'.\n\nSo looking at week 14 (row 13):\n\nOpponent: Houston\n\nMatch report: 'recap'\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met. So the claim is true because there's a recap for the game against Houston.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nIn the table provided, week 14 is December 7, 2008, opponent is Houston, time is noon cst, site is Lambeau Field, score L, record 5-8. The match report column says 'recap'.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where row_index is 13 (since it's zero-based), and the columns are 'opponent' and 'match report'. Wait, no: the claim refers to the recap being the match report for the game with Houston as opponent. So the two things to check are whether in that row, the opponent is Houston and the match report is 'recap'.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index 13 (week 14)\n- column_name 'opponent' because it's Houston\n- column_name 'match report' because it's 'recap'\n\nBut wait, does the claim require both to be true? Or just that there exists a row where recap is present and opponent is Houston?\n\nIn this case, yes, both are needed. So we need to verify in that specific row both conditions.\n\nSo the JSON should include two objects: one for 'opponent' and one for 'match report', with their respective values.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there is a \"recap\" entry in week 14 (row 13) where the opponent was Houston.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 13,\n  \"column_name\": \"opponent\",\n  \"value\": \"Houston\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 13,\n  \"column_name\": \"match report\",\n  \"value\": \"recap\"\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim: \"the game that have a record of 2 - 3 have a game site of lambeau field.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that any game with a win-loss record of 2-3 was played at Lambeau Field. So, my task is to check if there are any games in the table where the record is exactly 2-3 and their game site is Lambeau Field.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each week (row) and check for the 'record' column. The record format seems to be \"wins - losses,\" so a 2-3 record means 2 wins and 3 losses.\n\nLet me scan each row:\n\nWeek 1: Record is 1-0. Not 2-3.\nWeek 2: 2-0. Not 2-3.\nWeek 3: 2-1. Close, but not 2-3.\nWeek 4: 2-2. Not 2-3.\nWeek 5: 2-3. Okay, this matches the record mentioned in the claim. Now I need to check where this game was played.\n\nLooking at week 5's details: opponent is Atlanta, time is noon CDT, game site is Lambeau Field. So yes, it was at Lambeau Field.\n\nWeek 6: 3-3. Not relevant.\nWeek 7: 4-3. No.\nWeek 8: Blank, so irrelevant.\nWeek 9: 4-4. No.\nWeek 10: 4-5. No.\nWeek 11: 5-5. No.\nWeek 12: 5-6. No.\nWeek 13: 5-7. No.\nWeek 14: 5-8. No.\nWeek 15: 5-9. No.\nWeek 16: 5-10. No.\nWeek 17: 6-10. No.\n\nSo, only week 5 has a record of 2-3 and the game site is Lambeau Field. Therefore, the claim holds true for that particular game. \n\nBut wait, does the claim say \"the game\" implying multiple games? Or just that any game with that record uses that site. Since there's at least one game matching both conditions, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns are 'record' and 'game site'.

The claim says: \"the packer have a record of 2 - 2 when they play a game at raymond james stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. Record: 2 - 2\n2. Game location: Raymond James Stadium\n\nSo, I need to find in the table if there's any row where the game was played at Raymond James Stadium and the record after that game was 2-2.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details about the opponent, date, time/time zone, game site, final score, record, etc. The \"game site\" column might be key here.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Raymond James Stadium is mentioned as the game site and check what their record was after that game.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Week 4: September 28, 2008 vs Tampa Bay at Raymond James Stadium. Final score: loss (l, 30 -21). Record after this game would be 2-2 because before week 4, they were 2-1 after week 3. So in week 4, their record went from 2-1 to 2-2 after a loss.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"when they play a game at Raymond James Stadium,\" so I need to check if their record was exactly 2-2 during that particular game or just at some point when they played there. But in week 4, their record was 2-2 after the game.\n\nSo for that specific week (week 4), their game site is Raymond James Stadium, and their record before this game was 2-1, and after the loss, it became 2-2.\n\nBut does the claim specify whether the record at that exact game was 2-2? Or just that they had a record of 2-2 when playing there?\n\nI think the claim is saying that when they played at Raymond James Stadium, their overall record was 2-2. So for week 4, after the game, it's 2-2.\n\nTherefore, this seems to support the claim. But I should check if any other games were played at Raymond James Stadium with a different outcome or record. From the table provided, week 4 is the only one where Raymond James Stadium is listed as the site.\n\nSo, in that case, yes, their record was 2-2 after playing there.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the game play on october 5 , 2008 have a record of 2 - 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, the date in question is October 5, 2008. I'll look through the table to find the corresponding week and row. Scanning down the 'date' column: September 8,14,21,28,October 5... yes, that's row 5 (since weeks start at 1). So week 5 is October 5, 2008.\n\nNext, the claim mentions a \"record of 2 - 3\". In the table, there's a column called 'record' which shows the team's standing after each game. For week 5, I need to check what the record was after that game.\n\nLooking at row 5: The date is October 5, 2008. Opponent is Atlanta, game site Lambeau Field, time noon CDT. The final score is listed as \"l , 27 - 24\", meaning they lost by a margin of 3 points. But the record column for that week shows \"2 - 3\". So that matches: after the fifth game, their record was 2-3.\n\nI should make sure there are no other relevant cells beyond what's necessary. The claim specifically refers to the game play and its resulting record. So I need to check only the row corresponding to October 5, which is week 5 (row index 4 if we start counting from 0, but in the table it's labeled as row 5). The relevant columns here are 'date' for the specific game date and 'record' to verify their standing.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the JSON example, the indices are 0-based. So week 1 is index 0, up to week 17 being index 16. So October 5, 2008 is week 5, which would be row index 4. Therefore, in the table, it's row 5, but in the data structure, it's index 4.\n\nSo, for the claim, I need to identify the relevant cells: week and record. The date might be used as a secondary check to ensure we're looking at the right game. But since the claim is about the game play on that specific date, both the 'date' and 'record' columns are relevant.\n\nWait, but in the instructions, it says to look for which cells are relevant to verify the claim. So perhaps I need to find all cells that directly support the claim. The claim mentions two things: the date of the game and their record after that game.\n\nTherefore, for the date part, we have to make sure that October 5, 2008 is indeed week 5 (row index 4). Then, the 'record' column at row index 4 should be \"2 - 3\".\n\nYes, checking row 4 (index 4) in the table: record is indeed \"2 - 3\". So both parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}]}",

Opponent is Detroit, and after this game, the record is 6-10.\n\nWait, in week 3, the Packers have a record of 2-1, but the game site is Lambeau Field. So that's not Raymond James Stadium.\n\nIs there any game with a 2-1 record at Raymond James? Looking through all the weeks:\n\nIn week 4, the opponent is Tampa Bay, and they play at Raymond James, but their record after that game is 2-2.

Let me read through the claim carefully: \"the game site for the game that have a packer record of 2 - 2 be lambeau field and raymond james stadium.\" \n\nSo, first, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what it's saying. The claim is making two assertions:\n1. There is a game with a Packer record of 2-2.\n2. The game site for this particular game (the one with 2-2 record) is both Lambeau Field and Raymond James Stadium.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because a game can only have one game site. So maybe the claim is saying that all games with a 2-2 Packer record are played at either Lambeau Field or Raymond James Stadium. Or perhaps it's saying that for the specific game(s) that have a 2-2 record, their sites include both of those venues.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the record is 2-2 and see their game sites. Let me go through each row:\n\nWeek 1: Record is 1-0, game site Lambeau Field.\nWeek 2: 2-0, Ford Field.\nWeek 3: 2-1, Lambeau Field.\nWeek 4: 2-2, Raymond James Stadium.\nWeek 5: 2-3, Lambeau Field.\nAnd so on.\n\nSo in week 4, the record is 2-2 and the game site is Raymond James Stadium. In week 5, the record is 2-3, which doesn't apply here because we're looking for 2-2.\n\nWait, no, the claim refers to \"the game\" with a record of 2-2. But actually, there's only one game in the table with that exact record, right? Week 4 has 2-2 and the site is Raymond James Stadium. So according to the table, that particular game was at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nBut the claim says that the game site for the game(s) (plural?) with a 2-2 record are both Lambeau Field and Raymond James Stadium. That seems conflicting because in week 4, it's only Raymond James. Are there other games with 2-2?\n\nWait, let me check each row again:\n\nWeek 1: 1-0\nWeek 2: 2-0\nWeek 3: 2-1\nWeek 4: 2-2 (Raymond James)\nWeek 5: 2-3\nWeek 6: 3-3\nWeek 7: 4-3\nWeek 8: blank\nWeek 9: 4-4 (LP Field)\nWeek 10: 4-5\nWeek 11:5-5\nWeek12:5-6\nWeek13:5-7\nWeek14:5-8\nWeek15:5-9\nWeek16:5-10\nWeek17:6-10\n\nSo the only game with a 2-2 record is week 4. Therefore, the claim is referring to that specific game. The claim says that the site for this game was both Lambeau Field and Raymond James Stadium. But according to the table, week 4's game site is Raymond James Stadium. There's no mention of Lambeau Field for that week.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. It says \"the game site for the game that have a packer record of 2 - 2 be lambeau field and raymond james stadium.\" So perhaps it's implying that any game(s) with a 2-2 Packer record are played at either Lambeau or Raymond James, but in reality, only week 4 was at Raymond James. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because for the 2-2 game (week 4), the site was only Raymond James.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that the sites for games with a 2-2 record include both Lambeau and Raymond James. But in reality, the week 4 game was at Raymond James, not Lambeau. So the claim would be FALSE because the 2-2 game was only at Raymond James.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if any other games have a 2-2 record. Looking back, week 4 is the only one with 2-2. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the site being both Lambeau and Raymond James for that specific game is incorrect because it was only at Raymond James.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim states that the game site(s) for games with a 2-2 Packer record are both Lambeau Field and Raymond James Stadium. However, in reality, the single game with that exact record (week 4) took place at Raymond James Stadium, not Lambeau Field. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should also check if there's any possibility of multiple games with a 2-2 record. But looking through each week, only week 4 shows 2-2, and others either have higher records or different. So no, it's just one game at Raymond James.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the claim is trying to say that all 2-2 games are played in either of those two stadiums, not necessarily both for a single game. But the way the claim is phrased seems to refer to the specific game(s) having both sites, which isn't correct.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim is incorrect because the only game with a 2-2 record was at Raymond James Stadium, not Lambeau Field. Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game site for games with a Packer record of 2-2 is both Lambeau Field and Raymond James Stadium. However, upon examining the table, only week 4 has a 2-2 record, and its game site is Raymond James Stadium, not Lambeau Field. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The only game with a Packer record of 2-2 (Week 4) was played at Raymond James Stadium, not both Lambeau Field and Raymond James Stadium.\"\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the final score of the game that be at raymond james stadium be l , 30 - 16.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It's talking about a game played at Raymond James Stadium with a final score of L (loss), 30 to 16. So, my task is to look through the table and find out if there's any row where the game was held at Raymond James Stadium, and the final score matches this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week, date, opponent, time/time zone, game site, final score, record, and match report. The columns are: week, date, opponent, time/time zone, game site, final score, record, and match report.\n\nI need to identify which column is relevant here. The key information in the claim is \"raymond james stadium\" as the location and \"l , 30 - 16\" as the final score. So, I should check the 'game site' and 'final score' columns for each row.\n\nStarting with week 4: \n- Game site is Raymond James Stadium.\n- Final score is l, 30 - 21.\n\nWait, that's a loss but 30 to 21, not 16. So that's different from the claim which says 30 -16.\n\nNext, checking all rows where game site is Raymond James Stadium. From the table:\n\nWeek 4: Raymond James Stadium, final score l, 30-21.\nNo other weeks in the table have Raymond James Stadium as the game site except week 4. So that's the only relevant row for this part of the claim.\n\nNow checking the final score part: The claim says the final score was l, 30 -16. But in week 4, it's 30-21, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the final score at Raymond James Stadium for that game was different.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the ones from week 4: row index 3 (since weeks start at 1), and columns 'game site' and 'final score'.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the 'game site' and 'final score' columns. The only entry for Raymond James Stadium is in week 4 with a final score of l, 30-21, not matching the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions.\n\nThe claim is: \"the match report for the game that be against houston be bye\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Match Report**: This refers to the 'match report' column in the table.\n2. **Game Against Houston**: So I need to find a game where the opponent is Houston.\n3. **Be Bye**: The term \"bye\" here might be tricky. In sports, a bye typically means a team gets a rest week without playing, but in this context, it's likely referring to a tie or no result in the game. However, given the table's structure, I'll look for any indication of a bye in the 'final score' column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nI'll scan each row to find where the opponent is Houston.\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Minnesota\n- ...\n- Continuing through the rows:\n- Row 14: Opponent is Houston. The date is December 7, 2008.\n\nNow, check the 'final score' for this game (row 14). It's listed as \"l , 24 - 21\", which indicates a loss. There's no mention of a bye or any tie notation like \"ot\" (overtime) here. So, it doesn't show a bye.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is implying that the match report mentions a bye against Houston. I need to check if in row 14, under 'match report', there's any indication of a bye. The 'match report' for row 14 says \"recap\", which usually just summarizes the game but doesn't specify results like byes unless explicitly stated.\n\nSince the final score is a loss and no mention of a bye, the claim that the match report indicates a bye against Houston isn't supported. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"match report\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"l , 30 - 21 be the final score of the game that be at raymond james stadium , make the record 2 - 3.\" \n\nI notice some spelling issues in the claim, like \"be\" instead of \"be the\", but I think the main points are about the final score and the team's record after the game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, time/time zone, game site, final score, record, and match report. My goal is to check if there's a game where:\n\n1. The final score is \"l , 30 - 21\".\n2. The game was played at Raymond James Stadium.\n3. After this game, the team's record becomes 2 - 3.\n\nStarting with the final score: The table has multiple entries for final scores. I need to find a row where the final score column exactly matches \"l , 30 - 21\". \n\nLooking through each week:\n\n- Week 1: Final score is w, 24 - 19\n- Week 2: w, 48 -25\n- Week3: l,27-16\n- Week4: l,30-21 (Here it is)\n\nSo week 4 has the final score of \"l , 30 -21\".\n\nNow check where this game was played. The 'game site' column for week4 says \"raymond james stadium\". That matches.\n\nNext, what was the team's record after this game? Before week4, in week3, the record was 2-1 (after a loss). After week4, it becomes 2-2. So after week4, the record is 2-2, not 2-3 as the claim states.\n\nWait, the claim says \"make the record 2 -3\". But according to the table, after week4, the record is still 2-2. The next game where the record might change is week5: Atlanta, with a loss, making it 2-3.\n\nBut wait, in week4's case, the team had a loss but the record went from 2-1 to 2-2. So if the claim says that after this specific game (week4), the record becomes 2-3, that's incorrect because it only goes to 2-2.\n\nTherefore, even though there is a week with the final score \"l ,30 -21\" at Raymond James Stadium, the team's record doesn't become 2-3 as a result of that game. It was already 2-1 before, went to 2-2 after week4, and then in week5, it went to 2-3.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells: The row for week4 has the final score \"l ,30 -21\", so that's relevant. Also, the game site is Raymond James Stadium, which is another relevant cell.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Week4 (row index 3) and column 'final score'\n- Week4 (row index 3) and column 'game site'\n\nWait, but the table shows week as \"week\" in column headers. Let me check the columns again.\n\nLooking back at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: week, date, opponent, time/time zone, game site, final score, record, match report.\n\nSo each row's data corresponds to these columns. So for week4 (row index 3), the 'game site' is \"raymond james stadium\" and 'final score' is \"l ,30 -21\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Week 4, game site\n- Week4, final score\n\nSo in terms of JSON, each relevant cell is an object with row_index (3) and column_name as 'game site' or 'final score'.\n\nWait, but the claim also mentions that the record becomes 2 -3. The record after week4 was 2-2. So maybe we should include the 'record' column in relevant cells because it's part of the claim.\n\nBut the claim says \"make the record 2 -3\". However, after week4, the record is 2-2, not 2-3. So perhaps the relevant cell for record is not needed since it doesn't match, but maybe it's still relevant to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the final score and game site are directly related, as those are the main points of the claim.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should include all relevant cells mentioned in the claim. Since the claim mentions both the final score and the record, even though the record doesn't match, I think they're still relevant because the user is checking for correctness based on that information.\n\nSo perhaps, in addition to 'final score' and 'game site', we need to include 'record' as well.\n\nBut let me see: The claim says \"l ,30 -21 be the final score... make the record 2-3.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The row where final score is l,30-21 (week4)\n2. The game site for that row (raymond james stadium)\n3. The record after that game.\n\nWait, but in week4's data, the record column shows \"2-2\". So including that as a relevant cell would show it's 2-2, not 2-3, thus making the claim incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I think all three columns (final score, game site, and record) are relevant because they directly address the points in the claim.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nRelevant cells:\n\n1. Week4, final score: \"l ,30 -21\"\n2. Week4, game site: \"raymond james stadium\"\n3. Week4, record: \"2-2\"\n\nThese are all relevant because they either match or disprove the claim's assertions.\n\nTherefore, the JSON would include these three cells as objects in an array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim is: \"the match report be list as recap against houston on december 14 , 2008.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there's a match report titled \"recap\" against Houston on December 14, 2008. So I need to look for a row in the table where the opponent is Houston and the date is December 14, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details like week number, date, opponent, time/time zone, game site, final score, record, and match report. The claim specifically mentions the match report being listed as \"recap\" against Houston on that date.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: September 8 vs Minnesota\n- Week 2: September 14 vs Detroit\n- Week 3: September 21 vs Dallas\n- Week 4: September 28 vs Tampa Bay\n- Week 5: October 5 vs Atlanta\n- Week 6: October 12 vs Seattle\n- Week 7: October 19 vs Indianapolis\n- Week 8: Missing data, so skip\n- Week 9: November 2 vs Tennessee\n- Week 10: November 9 vs Minnesota\n- Week 11: November 16 vs Chicago\n- Week 12: November 24 vs New Orleans\n- Week 13: November 30 vs Carolina\n- Week 14: December 7 vs Houston\n- Week 15: December 14 vs Jacksonville\n- Week 16: December 22 vs Chicago\n- Week 17: December 28 vs Detroit\n\nWait, in week 14, the opponent is Houston on December 7. The claim says December 14, which is week 15 against Jacksonville. So that's different.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim mentions \"against houston,\" and looking at week 14, it's December 7 vs Houston, but perhaps the match report for that game might have a typo? Or maybe the claim refers to another game?\n\nWait, no. The claim is specifically about the match report being listed as \"recap\" against Houston on December 14. In the table, week 15 is December 14 vs Jacksonville, not Houston. So there's no game on December 14 against Houston.\n\nBut let me check if maybe the opponent in week 15 is Houston? Wait, no, week 15 is against Jacksonville. Therefore, there's no match report for Houston on December 14.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at each row carefully:\n\n- Week 14: December 7 vs Houston, game site is Lambeau Field, final score l, 24 -21, record 5-8.\n- The match report for week 14 would be \"recap\" as per the table's pattern. So the match report for that week is listed.\n\nBut the claim is about a game on December 14 against Houston, which doesn't exist in the table. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no such game.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread something. Let me check if any other weeks have Houston as the opponent. Looking at the table, week 14 is the only one with Houston as the opponent on December 7. So no match report exists for a game against Houston on December 14.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no such match report listed for that specific date and opponent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a match report against Houston on December 14, 2008.
