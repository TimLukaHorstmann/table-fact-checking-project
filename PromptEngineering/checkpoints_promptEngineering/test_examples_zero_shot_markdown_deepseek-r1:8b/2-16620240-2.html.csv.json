    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific match is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"On date 2004 - 07 - 02 the venue be idrottsparken and djurg\u00e5rden scorer be sj\u00f6lund and johansson.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the row corresponding to the date 2004-07-02. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n1. 2004 - 05 - 05\n2. 2004 - 05 - 21\n3. 2004 - 07 - 02 \u2192 This is the one we're interested in.\n4. 2004 - 07 - 14\n5. 2004 - 10 - 20\n6. 2004 - 11 - 06\n\nSo, row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed as per programming conventions) matches the date in question.\n\nNext, I need to verify each part of the claim against this row.\n\nThe first part is about the venue. In row 2, the 'venue' column has \"stadion.\" The claim says the venue should be \"idrottsparken.\" Since these don't match, this is a point of contention. So the venue doesn't match as per the claim.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"idrottsparken,\" but in the table, for 2004-07-02, the venue is listed as \"stadion.\" That's different. So that's one discrepancy.\n\nNow, looking at the opponents: the claim doesn't mention anything about the opponent, so I can skip this part unless the opponent info affects scorers, which it doesn't here.\n\nNext, the score is 3 - 1, but again, the claim doesn't specify it, so no issue there.\n\nThe competition column says \"1 / 16 - final,\" which isn't mentioned in the claim, so that's not a point of failure for the claim.\n\nNow, focusing on the djurg\u00e5rden scorers. The claim states \"sj\u00f6lund and johansson.\" In row 2, under 'djurg\u00e5rden scorers,' it says \"arneng , makondele , den ouden.\" Wait, that doesn't include sj\u00f6lund or johansson.\n\nSo there's another discrepancy here: the claim lists different scorers than what's in the table. Therefore, this is a problem.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Venue mismatch: idrottsparken vs. stadion \u2192 Problem.\n- Scorers mismatch: sj\u00f6lund and johansson vs. arneng, makondele, den ouden \u2192 Problem.\n\nSince both venue and scorers don't match the claim, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other relevant columns that could affect this. The attendance is there, but the claim doesn't mention it, so it's irrelevant here. Similarly, the opponents aren't part of the claim's focus, so they're not needed for verification.\n\nTherefore, based on the discrepancies found in both venue and scorers, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"djurg\u00e5rden scorers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
