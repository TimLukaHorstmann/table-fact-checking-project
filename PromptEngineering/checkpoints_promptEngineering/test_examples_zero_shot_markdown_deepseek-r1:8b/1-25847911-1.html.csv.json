    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and instructions.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"trust yourself! your mark will surely improve and friendship or entrance final decision have the same rating percent.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each episode has details including a title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. The claim seems to mention two specific aspects:\n\n1. An episode where the title is \"trust yourself! your mark will surely improve.\"\n2. Another episode where the title is \"friendship or entrance final decision\" and that it shares the same rating percent as the first one.\n\nI'll start by identifying which episodes match these titles.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- ep 9 has the title \"\u4fe1\u3058\u308d!\u6210\u7e3e\u306f\u5fc5\u305a\u4e0a\u304c\u308b\" which translates to \"Trust yourself! Your marks will surely improve.\" So this matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to find an episode with the title \"\u53cb\u60c5\u304b\u53d7\u9a13\u304b\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u6c7a\u65ad\" which is listed as ep 10. The translation is \"Friendship or entrance exam final decision.\" This seems to match the second part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the ratings for both episodes:\n\n- For ep 9 (row index 8), the rating is 14.5%.\n- For ep 10 (row index 9), the rating is also 14.5%.\n\nSince both have the same rating percent, the claim appears to be supported by these two episodes.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are for ep 9 and ep 10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"translation of title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"translation of title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"episode 3 be broadcast day 7 after episode 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that episode 3 was broadcast seven days after episode 2. So I need to check the dates for episodes 2 and 3 to see if there's a seven-day difference.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with its details. The relevant columns here are \"Unnamed: 0\", which seems to be the episode number, \"episode title\", but more importantly, the \"broadcast date\".\n\nLet me list out the episodes and their broadcast dates:\n\n- Episode 2: July 15, 2005\n- Episode 3: July 22, 2005\n- Episode 4: July 29, 2005\n- Episode 5: August 5, 2005\n- Episode 6: August 12, 2005\n- Episode 7: August 19, 2005\n- Episode 9: September 2, 2005\n- Episode 10: September 9, 2005\n\nNow, the claim is about episode 3 being seven days after episode 2. Let's calculate the difference between their broadcast dates.\n\nEpisode 2 was on July 15, and episode 3 was on July 22. So how many days are there from July 15 to July 22?\n\nJuly has 31 days. From July 15 to July 22 is 7 days (including both start and end dates? Or just the difference in dates). Wait, actually, when you subtract the dates: 22 - 15 = 7 days. So yes, episode 3 was broadcast seven days after episode 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct based on the dates provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I compared the broadcast dates of episodes 2 and 3. Episode 2 aired on July 15, 2005, and episode 3 followed on July 22, exactly seven days later.\n\n**Answer: TRUE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"episode 9 has a higher rating than episode 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: comparing two episodes, specifically episode 9 and episode 3. So, I need to find their respective ratings in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various columns like \"Unnamed: 0\", \"episode title\", etc. The column that contains the ratings is labeled \"ratings\". My focus should be on this column for both episodes in question.\n\nStarting with episode 9, I'll find its row. Scanning through the \"Unnamed: 0\" column (which seems to list the episodes as 'ep 2', 'ep 3', etc.), I see that 'ep 9' is listed under \"Unnamed: 0\". So, that's the relevant row for episode 9.\n\nNow, checking its rating. The ratings are provided in a numerical format with a percentage sign, like \"16.5%\", so I can compare these numbers directly without worrying about the sign or units since higher numbers would indicate higher ratings.\n\nNext, looking at episode 3. Its \"Unnamed: 0\" is 'ep 3'. In that row, the rating is listed as 13.8%.\n\nSo, for episode 9, I need to find its rating. Scanning each row until I reach 'ep 9', and then checking the ratings column, I see it has a rating of 14.5%.\n\nNow, comparing the two: 14.5% (episode 9) vs. 13.8% (episode 3). Since 14.5 is higher than 13.8, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any other rows or columns that might affect this comparison? The other columns like episode title, romanized title, and translation don't impact the numerical rating, so they can be ignored for this specific claim.\n\nAlso, double-checking the row indices: the table starts with 'ep 2' as row index 0. So, ep 3 is row 1 (since rows are zero-indexed), and ep 9 is row 8 because it's the ninth episode after ep 2.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For episode 3: row_index=1, column_name=\"ratings\"\n- For episode 9: row_index=8, column_name=\"ratings\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE as episode 9 has a higher rating than episode 3.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the TV series be broadcast in the same year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that every single TV episode listed in the table was broadcast in the same year. To verify this, I need to check each episode's broadcast date and ensure they all fall within one specific calendar year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with its title, romanized title, translation of the title, broadcast date, and ratings. The key column here is \"broadcast date,\" so that's what I should focus on.\n\nLet me list out the broadcast dates for each episode:\n\n1. ep 2: July 15, 2005\n2. ep 3: July 22, 2005\n3. ep 4: July 29, 2005\n4. ep 5: August 5, 2005\n5. ep 6: August 12, 2005\n6. ep 7: August 19, 2005\n7. ep 9: September 2, 2005\n8. ep 10: September 9, 2005\n\nNow, I need to check if all these dates are within the same year. The years aren't explicitly stated in the table, but looking at the dates:\n\n- July and August are months that typically belong to the same year.\n- Similarly, September is also part of the same year as July and August.\n\nSo, all the broadcast dates fall in 2005 because none of them cross into a new year like 2006. Therefore, they were all aired in the same year, 2005.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if any date might be from a different year. Let's look at each date again:\n\n- ep 2: July 15, 2005 \u2192 Year 2005\n- ep 3: July 22, 2005 \u2192 2005\n- ep 4: July 29, 2005 \u2192 2005\n- ep 5: August 5, 2005 \u2192 2005\n- ep 6: August 12, 2005 \u2192 2005\n- ep 7: August 19, 2005 \u2192 2005\n- ep 9: September 2, 2005 \u2192 2005\n- ep 10: September 9, 2005 \u2192 2005\n\nYes, all the dates are in 2005. So each TV series episode was broadcast in the same year, which is 2005.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because every single episode's broadcast date falls within the same calendar year.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"all of the TV series be broadcast in the same year,\" we check each episode's broadcast date:\n\n- All dates (July to September 2005) fall within 2005.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"there be 2 episode that be broadcast in september.\" So, first, I should check the 'broadcast date' column for episodes aired in September.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an 'Unnamed: 0' which seems to indicate the episode number, like ep 2, ep 3, etc. Then there's the 'episode title', but the key info is the 'broadcast date'. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- ep 2: July 15, 2005 \u2013 July, so not September.\n- ep 3: July 22, 2005 \u2013 July as well.\n- ep 4: July 29, 2005 \u2013 July again.\n- ep 5: August 5, 2005 \u2013 August, not September.\n- ep 6: August 12, 2005 \u2013 August.\n- ep 7: August 19, 2005 \u2013 August.\n- ep 9: September 2, 2005 \u2013 Yes, September.\n- ep 10: September 9, 2005 \u2013 Also September.\n\nSo, ep 9 and ep 10 are in September. That's two episodes. The claim says \"2 episode that be broadcast in september.\" So it seems TRUE because there are exactly two episodes in September.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking at the table structure, each row has 'broadcast date' as the fourth column. But in the markdown, columns are: Unnamed: 0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, ratings. So the fifth column is 'ratings', and the sixth is 'broadcast date'.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the markdown:\n\n| Unnamed: 0   | episode title            | romanized title                       | translation of title                           | broadcast date     | ratings   |\n\nSo columns are:\n\n1. Unnamed: 0\n2. episode title\n3. romanized title\n4. translation of title\n5. broadcast date\n6. ratings\n\nSo the 'broadcast date' is column 5. So for each row, I need to check if the fifth cell is September.\n\nFor ep 9 and ep 10:\n\nep 9: september 2, 2005 \u2013 yes.\nep 10: september 9, 2005 \u2013 yes.\n\nSo, in terms of row indices (assuming rows start at 0), ep 9 is row index 8? Wait, let me check the table again. The first row after headers is ep 2 as row 0?\n\nWait, the markdown starts with:\n\n| Unnamed: 0   | episode title            | romanized title                       | translation of title                           | broadcast date     | ratings   |\n|:-------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------------|:----------|\n| ep 2         | \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u5f31\u3055\u3092\u77e5\u308c!        | jibun no yowasa wo shire!             | know your weaknesses!                          | july 15 , 2005     | 16.5%     |\n| ep 3         | \u904a\u3079!\u53d7\u9a13\u306f\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u3060!   | asobe! juken wa supootsu da!          | entrance exams are sports , so play!           | july 22 , 2005     | 13.8%     |\n| ep 4         | \u58c1\u306b\u3076\u3064\u304b\u308b\u307e\u3067\u6211\u6162\u3057\u308d | kabe ni butsukaru made gaman shiro    | hold out until you hit the wall                | july 29 , 2005     | 16.1%     |\n| ep 5         | \u6ce3\u304f\u306a!\u304a\u524d\u306e\u4eba\u751f\u3060!     | nakuna! omae no jinsei da!            | don't cry! it 's your life!                    | august 5 , 2005    | 16.8%     |\n| ep 6         | \u82f1\u8a9e\u5bfe\u6c7a!\u52dd\u8ca0\u3060\u30d0\u30ab6\u4eba   | eigo taiketsu! shoubu da baka rokunin | english showdown! fight for stupid 6           | august 12 , 2005   | 17.9%     |\n| ep 7         | \u898b\u8fd4\u3057\u3066\u3084\u308b!\u6771\u5927\u6a21\u8a66    | mikaeshite yaru! toudai moshi         | vengeance! mock exam for tokyo university      | august 19 , 2005   | 15.6%     |\n| ep 9         | \u4fe1\u3058\u308d!\u6210\u7e3e\u306f\u5fc5\u305a\u4e0a\u304c\u308b  | shinjiro! seiseki wa kanarazu agaru   | trust yourself! your marks will surely improve | september 2 , 2005 | 14.5%     |\n| ep 10        | \u53cb\u60c5\u304b\u53d7\u9a13\u304b\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u6c7a\u65ad   | yuujou ka juken ka saigo no ketsudan  | friendship or entrance exam final decision     | september 9 , 2005 | 14.5%     |\n\nWait, the table has 8 rows after the headers? Let me count: ep2 (row0), ep3(row1), ep4(row2), ep5(row3), ep6(row4), ep7(row5), ep9(row6), ep10(row7). So ep9 is row6 and ep10 is row7.\n\nSo, the relevant columns are 'broadcast date', which is column 5. Therefore, for each of these rows, I should include their row index (0-based) and the column name \"broadcast date\".\n\nSo for ep9: row_index=6, column_name=\"broadcast date\"\n\nep10: row_index=7, same column.\n\nTherefore, relevant_cells would be two objects: one for row 6, another for row7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two episodes in September (ep 9 and ep 10), so the answer is TRUE.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that episode 9's rating is higher than every other episode's rating. So, my task is to check each of the episodes and see if episode 9 indeed has the highest rating.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I can see it lists several episodes with their respective ratings. The relevant columns for this task are \"Unnamed: 0\" (which seems to be the episode number), \"episode title\", \"romanized title\", etc., but primarily, the \"ratings\" column is important here.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to episode 9. Scanning through the \"Unnamed: 0\" column, I see that ep 9 is the one we're interested in. So, the relevant_cells should include the row index for ep 9 and the \"ratings\" column.\n\nNext, I need to compare episode 9's rating with all other episodes. From the table:\n\n- Ep 2: 16.5%\n- Ep 3: 13.8%\n- Ep 4: 16.1%\n- Ep 5: 16.8%\n- Ep 6: 17.9%\n- Ep 7: 15.6%\n- Ep 10: 14.5%\n\nEp 9 has a rating of 14.5%. Now, I need to check if this is higher than all the others listed.\n\nLooking at each episode's rating:\n\n- Ep 2: 16.5% \u2013 which is higher than 14.5%\n- Ep 3: 13.8% \u2013 lower\n- Ep 4: 16.1% \u2013 higher\n- Ep 5: 16.8% \u2013 higher\n- Ep 6: 17.9% \u2013 higher\n- Ep 7: 15.6% \u2013 higher\n- Ep 10: 14.5% \u2013 same as ep 9\n\nSo, there are several episodes with ratings higher than 14.5%. Specifically, Ep 2 (16.5%), Ep 4 (16.1%), Ep 5 (16.8%), and Ep 6 (17.9%) all have higher ratings.\n\nTherefore, the claim that episode 9 has a higher rating than all other episodes is false because there are episodes with higher ratings than episode 9.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"dragon zakura be broadcast over 2 year.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided in markdown. It has several columns: Unnamed: 0 (which seems like an episode number), episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. Each row represents a different episode with details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"dragon zakura,\" which isn't something I recognize immediately. Looking at the 'episode title' column, I see episodes like \"\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u5f31\u3055\u3092\u77e5\u308c!\" (ep 2), \"\u904a\u3079!\u53d7\u9a13\u306f\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u3060!\" (ep 3), and so on. None of these titles mention \"dragon zakura.\" So maybe it's not a direct match.\n\nBut the claim is about broadcasting over two years, which relates to the 'broadcast date' column. Each row has a specific broadcast date: from July 15, 2005, up through September 9, 2005. Wait, that\u2019s only five months, right? From July to September is about half a year, not two full years.\n\nSo the claim says \"over 2 year,\" which would imply more than two calendar years, like spanning from 2005 to 2007 or something. But the table shows episodes all broadcast in 2005, within a single year. Therefore, it's definitely not over two years.\n\nAdditionally, there are seven episodes listed here. If \"dragon zakura\" is supposed to be one of them, but that title isn't present, maybe the claim is referring to multiple series or something else, but based on this table, it doesn't hold up.\n\nSo putting it all together: The broadcast dates in the table are within 2005, so not two years. Also, no episode with \"dragon zakura\" is listed here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"dragon zakura\" was broadcast over two years. However, examining the provided table, none of the episodes have this title. Furthermore, all episodes were aired in 2005, spanning only about six months. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"episode 3 be broadcast more than a week after episode 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that episode 3 was broadcast more than a week after episode 2. That means I need to check how many days apart their broadcast dates are and see if it's more than 7 days.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each episode has a number (like ep 2) and details including the broadcast date. So I should find the relevant cells for episodes 2 and 3.\n\nIn the table, each row starts with \"Unnamed: 0\", which seems to be the episode number. For example, the second row is ep 2, so that's episode 2. The third row is ep 3, so that's episode 3. \n\nNext, I need their broadcast dates. For episode 2, it's July 15, 2005, and for episode 3, August 12, 2005.\n\nNow, calculate the days between these two dates. From July 15 to July 31 is about 16 days (since July has 31 days). Then from August 1 to August 12 is another 11 days. So total days are 16 + 11 = 27 days apart. That's way more than a week, which is 7 days.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because episode 3 was indeed broadcast more than a week after episode 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "no episode be broadcast in september",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"no episode be broadcast in september\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: Unnamed: 0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. Each row represents an episode with its details.\n\nThe claim is about whether any episodes were broadcast in September. So, my task is to check each row's broadcast date to see if any fall in September 2005.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- ep 2: July 15, 2005\n- ep 3: July 22, 2005\n- ep 4: July 29, 2005\n- ep 5: August 5, 2005\n- ep 6: August 12, 2005\n- ep 7: August 19, 2005\n- ep 9: September 2, 2005\n- ep 10: September 9, 2005\n\nNow, I need to verify the dates. September has two episodes: ep 9 on September 2 and ep 10 on September 9. Both are in September 2005.\n\nThe claim states that \"no episode be broadcast in september.\" But clearly, there are episodes (ep 9 and ep 10) that were broadcast in September. Therefore, the claim is false because episodes did air in September.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for this verification. The relevant column is \"broadcast date,\" as it directly relates to the timeframe of each episode's airing. So, I should look at each row where the broadcast date falls in September.\n\nSpecifically, ep 9 and ep 10 have broadcast dates in September. Therefore, their corresponding rows under the \"broadcast date\" column are relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are for row indices 8 (ep 9) and 9 (ep 10), both under the \"broadcast date\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
