    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"jason gillespie have the highest score out of all the player.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and identify where Jason Gillespie is listed. Scanning through the players' names, I see that Jason Gillespie is in row 6 (since it starts from row 0). His score is 201 not out. So his score is 201.\n\nNow, I should check all other players to see if anyone has a higher score than 201. Let's go through each player one by one:\n\n1. nasim - ul - ghani: 101\n2. tony mann: 105\n3. syed kirmani: 101 not out\n4. mark boucher: 125 and another entry of 108, both lower than 201.\n5. jason gillespie's other entries aren't relevant since we only need to check if he has the highest.\n\nWait, actually, each player can have multiple entries because they might play against different teams in different years. So for each player, I should consider all their scores across the table.\n\nBut the claim is about \"all the players,\" meaning across the entire table. So Jason Gillespie's 201 is compared to every other score in the table.\n\nLooking at the highest score among all players:\n\n- The maximum score seems to be 201 by Jason Gillespie, as the others are 101, 105, 125, and 108. Wait, no, mark boucher has 125 and another entry of 108. So 125 is higher than 101 but lower than 201.\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Let me recount all the scores:\n\n- nasim: 101\n- tony mann: 105\n- syed kirmani: 101 not out (which I think means he scored 101 and didn't get out, so it's still 101)\n- mark boucher: 125 and 108\n- jason gillespie: 201 not out\n\nSo the highest score is indeed 201 by Jason Gillespie. Therefore, his claim is true.\n\nBut wait, the table shows that there are two entries for mark boucher against south africa in 1999 with scores 125 and 108. So the maximum score among all players is 201 by Jason Gillespie, so his claim holds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if Jason Gillespie's score is the highest across all players.\n\n1. **Identify Jason Gillespie's entry:**\n   - Row index: 6\n   - Score: 201 not out\n\n2. **Compare his score with others:**\n   - Other scores in the table are 101, 105, 101, 125, 108.\n   - The highest is 201 by Jason Gillespie.\n\nSince Jason Gillespie's score (201) is higher than all other players' scores, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"syed kirmani and nasim - ul - ghani have the same score\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns: player, team, score, versus, and year. Each row represents a different match or game, with details about the players, their teams, scores, the opponents they were facing, and the year it took place.\n\nThe claim is comparing two specific players: Syed Kirmani and Nasim-ul-Ghani. I need to check if both of them have the same score in the table. \n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. The first row has \"nasim - ul - ghani\" as the player, scored 101 against England in 1962.\n2. The third row is about Syed Kirmani; he scored 101 not out against Australia in 1979.\n\nSo I need to compare these two players' scores.\n\nNasim-ul-Ghani's score is 101. Syed Kirmani's score is also 101, but it's noted as \"not out.\" Now, does \"not out\" affect the comparison? In cricket, a not out means the batsman didn't get dismissed but still contributed to the team's total by remaining at the crease. However, in terms of the actual runs scored, both players have 101.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"not out\" might imply that they didn't face all balls or something else. But for the purpose of this claim, I think it's just about the numerical score. So if both have 101, then their scores are the same, regardless of whether Kirmani was not out or not.\n\nSo checking the relevant cells: For Syed Kirmani, he is in row 2 (if we start counting from 0, but sometimes rows are counted starting at 1). Let me check the indices. The first row is index 0, so Syed Kirmani would be row 2? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe table has six rows:\n\nRow 0: nasim - ul - ghani\nRow 1: tony mann\nRow 2: syed kirmani\nRow 3: mark boucher\nRow 4: mark boucher again\nRow 5: jason gillespie\n\nSo Syed Kirmani is at row index 2, column \"score\" is 101 not out. Nasim is at row index 0, score is 101.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 0 and row 2 in the \"score\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that both players have the same score. Both Syed Kirmani and Nasim-ul-Ghani scored 101, so it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2 player in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from australia\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions \"nightwatchman (cricket)\" and specifies that two players who played as the nightwatchman came from Australia. I'm not entirely sure what a nightwatchman in cricket refers to, but I think it's a term used for a specific role or position where a player comes on to bat when the innings is in trouble. So, they might be a lower-order batsman who can stabilize the innings.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a player, their team, score, versus opponent, and year. The task is to check whether any two players from Australia are listed as nightwatchmen in this context.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which players are from Australia. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. nasim - ul - ghani is from Pakistan.\n2. tony mann is from Australia.\n3. syed kirmani is from India.\n4. mark boucher is from South Africa.\n5. jason gillespie is from Australia.\n\nSo, in this table, there are two players from Australia: tony mann and jason gillespie. Now I need to check if either of them has a nightwatchman role mentioned. The table doesn't explicitly state roles like \"nightwatchman,\" but the column names are player, team, score, versus, and year.\n\nThe claim is about two players in the nightwatchman role coming from Australia. Since the table doesn't specify their roles beyond what's provided, I have to infer based on the data given or perhaps look for any additional context that might link a player to being a nightwatchman.\n\nTony Mann played against India in 1977 with a score of 105. Jason Gillespie played against Bangladesh in 2006 with a score of 201 not out. There's no mention of them being nightwatchmen here, but maybe the term \"nightwatchman\" is more about their playing style or role in the team.\n\nGiven that the claim refers to two players from Australia in this role, and there are exactly two Australian players in the table, I think it's reasonable to connect tony mann and jason gillespie as nightwatchmen. However, without explicit information about their roles, this is an assumption. But since the table doesn't provide more details, I have to go with what's available.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems plausible based on the two Australian players in the list. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those of tony mann and jason gillespie.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"mark boucher have a higher score than tony mann\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who Mark Boucher and Tony Mann are in the table. From the table, I can see that there are two players named Mark Boucher. The first one is listed under \"mark boucher\" with a score of 125 against Zimbabwe in 1999, and another entry for Mark Boucher with a score of 108 against England in the same year.\n\nTony Mann is another player in the table with a score of 105 against India in 1977. So, there are two relevant players here: Mark Boucher and Tony Mann.\n\nNext, I need to compare their scores. The claim says that Mark Boucher has a higher score than Tony Mann. To verify this, I'll look at all the scores for both players in the table.\n\nLooking at Mark Boucher's entries:\n- 125 against Zimbabwe\n- 108 against England\n\nAnd Tony Mann's entry:\n- 105 against India\n\nNow, let's compare each of Mark Boucher's scores to Tony Mann's score. \n\nFirst, 125 compared to 105: 125 is higher than 105.\nNext, 108 compared to 105: 108 is also higher than 105.\n\nSince both instances where Mark Boucher played resulted in scores higher than Tony Mann's single entry, the claim seems to hold true based on the provided data.\n\nHowever, I should also consider whether there are any other factors that might affect this comparison. For example, are there different opponents or years? The table includes versus columns and years, but since both players have their respective scores against different opponents in different years, the direct score comparison is still valid because the claim doesn't mention anything about the opponents or the specific context of the matches.\n\nAnother thing to check is if I've missed any entries for either player. Scanning through the table again, Mark Boucher appears twice, and Tony Mann once, so all relevant entries have been considered.\n\nTherefore, based on the scores provided, Mark Boucher's highest score (125) is indeed higher than Tony Mann's (105), and his other score (108) is also higher. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman (cricket)\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if it relates to England playing cricket twice. The table has several columns: player, team, score, versus, and year.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Player is \"nasim - ul - ghani\", Team is Pakistan vs England in 1962. This isn't relevant because the claim is about England playing, not Pakistan.\n   \n2. **Row 1**: Player is \"tony mann\", Team is Australia vs India in 1977. Again, not related to England.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Player is \"syed kirmani\", Team is India vs Australia in 1979. Still not about England.\n\n4. **Row 3 and 4**: Both are \"mark boucher\" playing for South Africa against Zimbabwe and England in 1999. These don't involve England as the opposing team except once, but it's about South Africa vs England, so maybe relevant if looking for when England is playing others.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Player is \"jason gillespie\", Team is Australia vs Bangladesh in 2006. Not related to England.\n\nWait, let me re-examine. The claim says \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman (cricket)\". So I'm looking for two instances where England is playing against someone else.\n\nLooking at the table, in row 3 and 4, mark boucher plays for South Africa against Zimbabwe and then South Africa vs England. So South Africa is playing both Zimbabwe and England, but that's not about England as the team.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: In row 3, versus is Zimbabwe, so South Africa vs Zimbabwe. Row 4: versus is England, so South Africa vs England. So in row 4, the \"versus\" is England. But the player is South Africa. So does that mean South Africa played against England once? Or is it about when England plays others?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The table lists the team each player represents. So for example, in row 0, nasim - ul - ghani is playing for Pakistan against England.\n\nSo, to find times when England plays someone else, we need rows where the \"team\" is England and they are playing against another team.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Pakistan vs England.\n- Row 1: Australia vs India.\n- Row 2: India vs Australia.\n- Row 3: South Africa vs Zimbabwe.\n- Row 4: South Africa vs England.\n- Row 5: Australia vs Bangladesh.\n\nSo, in row 0 and row 4, the team is Pakistan and South Africa respectively playing against England. So that's two instances where someone plays against England. Wait, but the claim says \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman\". So if we're considering when England is playing others, perhaps the table only shows when others play against England.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see if England is playing twice. The \"versus\" column indicates who they are playing against. So in row 0 and row 4, England is playing Pakistan and South Africa. But that's two times? No, wait, it's two different opponents: Pakistan once and South Africa once. So is the claim saying England played twice against any opponent?\n\nWait, the claim says \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman\". I'm not sure if it's about the number of matches or specific to the term \"nightwatchman\".\n\nLooking at the table again, perhaps \"nightwatchman\" refers to a player position or something else. But in the given data, there are no cells named \"nightwatchman\". So maybe that part is irrelevant.\n\nSo focusing on whether England played two times. From the table:\n\n- In 1962: Pakistan vs England.\n- In 1999: South Africa vs England.\n\nThat's two instances where teams other than England are playing against England. So if the claim is about England playing twice, perhaps it's true because they have two matches against different opponents.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman\". If \"nightwatchman\" refers to a specific term or position, and the table doesn't include that information, then maybe it's not directly supported. However, if we're just considering the number of times England is playing against others based on the \"versus\" column, then yes, they played twice: against Pakistan and South Africa.\n\nBut looking back at the claim, it says \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman\". So perhaps it's about the number of matches in which England was involved as the opposing team. Since there are two such entries (Pakistan vs England and South Africa vs England), that would support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that England played two times with a specific term or position, but since that term isn't in the table, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The task is to check if the claim is fully supported by the table. So the claim states that England played twice. Looking at the \"versus\" column, there are two instances where England is on the opposing side: against Pakistan and South Africa. Therefore, it's correct that England played twice.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the rows where the versus column is England, which are row 0 (Pakistan vs England) and row 4 (South Africa vs England). So their row indices are 0 and 4, and the column is \"versus\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with relevant cells being those two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that England played twice. In the table, there are two instances where teams play against England: Pakistan in 1962 (row 0) and South Africa in 1999 (row 4). These correspond to the \"versus\" column.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Columns:** We focus on the \"team\", \"versus\", and \"year\" columns.\n2. **Locate Matches Involving England:** Look for rows where the team is playing against England in the \"versus\" column.\n3. **Find Relevant Rows:** Two such rows exist (0 and 4), indicating two matches involving England.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"versus\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"versus\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"jason gillespie's score be more than double that of nasim - ul - ghani's.\" So I need to compare Jason Gillespie's score to Nasim-Ul-Ghani's score and see if Jason's is more than double.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table. The relevant columns are player, team, score, versus, and year. But for this claim, I'm only concerned with the players mentioned: Jason Gillespie and Nasim-Ul-Ghani. So I should find their respective scores.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For Nasim-Ul-Ghani: In row 0, his name is listed as nasim - ul - ghani. His score is 101.\n- For Jason Gillespie: Looking down the players, in row 5, the player is jason gillespie, and his score is 201 not out.\n\nWait, so Nasim-Ul-Ghani has a score of 101, and Jason Gillespie has a score of 201 not out. The claim says Jason's score is more than double Nasim's. Let me calculate that.\n\nDouble of 101 is 202. So is 201 (not out) more than 202? No, because 201 is less than 202. Therefore, the claim would be false. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake here because sometimes \"not out\" might imply something else, but in terms of raw score points, it's still 201.\n\nSo Jason's score is 201, which is just 1 short of double (101 * 2 = 202). Therefore, 201 is not more than double. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The players are in different rows and columns. For Nasim-Ul-Ghani, he's in row 0 under \"player\" column. For Jason Gillespie, he's in row 5, same column.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include both their player entries.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}]}",

The claim states that \"Syed Kirmani and Nasim - ul - Ghani tie for the highest score.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each player mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with Syed Kirmani. From the table, Syed Kirmani is in row 2 (since indexing starts from 0, but sometimes people count rows starting at 1; I need to clarify that). His details are: team India, score 101 not out, versus Australia, year 1979. So his score is 101 not out.\n\nNext, Nasim - ul - Ghani. Looking for this name in the table, it's in row 0: player column has \"nasim - ul - ghani\", team Pakistan, score 101, versus England, year 1962. His score is 101.\n\nSo both have a score of 101. However, Syed Kirmani's score is 101 not out, which might indicate that he didn't face all balls or something else. But in terms of numerical value, they are equal at 101 each.\n\nThe claim says they \"tie for the highest score.\" So I need to check if 101 is indeed the highest score in the table.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: 101\n- Row 1: 105\n- Row 2: 101 not out\n- Row 3: 125\n- Row 4: 108\n- Row 5: 201 not out\n\nWait, Jason Gillespie has 201 not out, which is the highest in the table. So if the claim says that Syed Kirmani and Nasim - ul - Ghani tie for the highest score, but there's someone else with a higher score (201), then their scores are not the highest. Therefore, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"highest score\" refers only to those two players. But in that case, they each have 101, which is less than 201 and 125 and 105.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"2 player in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from pakistan.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"nightwatchman\" in cricket refers to a batting position where a lower-order batsman comes in to bat late in the innings, often when the top-order batsmen have been dismissed. They are typically used as defensive players.\n\nThe claim mentions two players who fit this role and come from Pakistan. So I need to look into the table provided to see if there are any players known for being nightwatchmen who are from Pakistan.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a player's name, their team, score, versus, and year. The relevant columns here would be \"player\" and \"team.\" Since the claim is about players coming from Pakistan as nightwatchmen, I need to find if any of the players in the table are known for being nightwatchmen and if they are from Pakistan.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. nasim - ul - ghani plays for Pakistan against England in 1962.\n2. tony mann is with Australia against India in 1977.\n3. syed kirmani plays for India against Australia in 1979.\n4. mark boucher is with South Africa against Zimbabwe and England in 1999.\n5. jason gillespie is with Australia against Bangladesh in 2006.\n\nI don't have any prior knowledge about these players specifically as nightwatchmen, but I can infer that a nightwatchman is usually a lower-order batsman. So perhaps if a player is known for being a reliable or defensive batsman, they might have been used as a nightwatchman.\n\nHowever, without explicit information in the table about their roles, it's hard to confirm. The claim is about two players who are nightwatchmen from Pakistan. Since none of the players listed are from Pakistan except nasim - ul - ghani, and there's only one player here, the claim would be false because it refers to two players.\n\nAdditionally, if I look at the column \"score,\" sometimes a lower score or not out indicates they might have been batting later, possibly as nightwatchmen. For example, syed kirmani has 101 not out against Australia in 1979. That could suggest he was a nightwatchman because he's not out, implying he stayed at the crease until the end.\n\nBut again, without explicit information about their roles, this is speculative. Since the claim refers to two players from Pakistan known as nightwatchmen, and only one player from Pakistan is in the table (nasim - ul - ghani), the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are two players from Pakistan who were nightwatchmen in cricket.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"England play Pakistan 2 times in the nightwatchman (cricket)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. England plays against Pakistan.\n2. This happens twice.\n3. It takes place during a \"nightwatchman\" event in cricket.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a player, their team, score, versus, and year. I need to check if there are any matches where England is playing against Pakistan, specifically multiple instances.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: nasim - ul - ghani plays for Pakistan against England in 1962. So that's one match between England and Pakistan.\n- Row 1: tony mann (Australia vs India) \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 2: syed kirmani (India vs Australia) \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 3: mark boucher (South Africa vs Zimbabwe) \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 4: same player, another match for South Africa against England in 1999. So that's another match between England and Pakistan? Wait, wait, no\u2014Pakistan is a team here, but this row shows South Africa vs England. So actually, it's South Africa vs England, which isn't the claim we're checking.\n- Row 5: jason gillespie (Australia vs Bangladesh) \u2013 not relevant.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. The fifth row lists Australia vs Bangladesh in 2006. So, only the first and fourth rows involve England? Wait no, the fourth row is South Africa vs Zimbabwe, which isn't Pakistan. Let me double-check.\n\nRow 0: nasim - ul - ghani (Pakistan) vs England.\nRow 4: mark boucher (South Africa) vs England. So that's another match between South Africa and England, not Pakistan.\n\nSo, from the table, I see only one match where England plays against Pakistan\u2014in row 0. Therefore, the claim says \"England play Pakistan twice,\" but according to the table, it's only once.\n\nNow, about the term \"nightwatchman.\" I'm not entirely sure what that refers to in cricket terms. A nightwatchman is often a lower-order batsman who comes in late to bat, usually when there are few runs required. But in this context, does it refer to an event or a position? If it's an event name, like a specific tournament or series, I don't see any such information in the table. The table just lists individual matches with the opposing teams.\n\nTherefore, while England has played against Pakistan as per the table, there's only one instance mentioned. Additionally, the term \"nightwatchman\" doesn't seem to align with the matches listed here. It might be a specific event not captured in this table, or it could be an incorrect assumption.\n\nPutting it together, the claim is about England playing Pakistan twice under the nightwatchman context, but the table shows only one match between them and no evidence of a \"nightwatchman\" event related to these matches.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions that England plays against Pakistan twice during a \"nightwatchman\" cricket event. However, upon analyzing the table:\n\n- Only one match is found where England plays against Pakistan (Row 0).\n- No evidence in the table indicates any \"nightwatchman\" events or series.\n\nThus, the claim lacks support from the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"versus\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "mark boucher have the highest score",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"mark boucher have the highest score\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that Mark Boucher has the highest score. To verify this, I should look into the table provided to find Mark Boucher's scores and compare them with other players' highest scores.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice there are two entries for Mark Boucher:\n1. In 1999 against Zimbabwe, he scored 125.\n2. Also in 1999 against England, he scored 108.\n\nSo Mark Boucher's highest score is 125.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is indeed the highest score among all players listed. Let's go through each player:\n\n- Nasim - ul - Ghani: 101\n- Tony Mann: 105\n- Syed Kirmani: 101 not out (which is 101)\n- Mark Boucher: 125 and 108, so max is 125\n- Jason Gillespie: 201 not out\n\nWait a minute, Jason Gillespie scored 201 not out. That's higher than Mark Boucher's 125. So if the claim is that Mark Boucher has the highest score, this would be false because Jason Gillespie's score is higher.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells should include all entries for Mark Boucher and the player with the highest score (Jason Gillespie) to compare their scores.\n\nSo, in terms of cell indices:\n- Mark Boucher appears at row index 3 and 4.\n- Jason Gillespie is at row index 5.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows 3, 4, and 5 for columns 'score'.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"mark boucher have the highest score\" is TRUE or FALSE, we compare Mark Boucher's scores with those of other players in the table. Mark Boucher's highest score is 125, but Jason Gillespie scored 201 not out, which is higher. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. Identify Mark Boucher's scores (rows 3 and 4).\n2. Check all players' scores to find the highest.\n3. Determine that Jason Gillespie has a higher score than Mark Boucher.\n\nSince Jason Gillespie scored higher, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
