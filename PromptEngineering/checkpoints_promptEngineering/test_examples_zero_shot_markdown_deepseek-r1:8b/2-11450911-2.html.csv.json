    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various fight records, and I need to determine whether the claim is true or false: \"keiko tamai lose 2 times after win her first match.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to see if Keiko Tamai's fights are recorded there. Scanning each row, the names listed as opponents are shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, etc., but I don't immediately see \"keiko tamai\" in the opponent column. Wait, maybe she's a fighter, not an opponent? The table lists the opponent's name each time, so Keiko Tamai must be listed there as the fighter.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe Keiko Tamai is on the opposite side of the table? Let me check all rows to see if any of them have \"keiko tamai\" in the 'opponent' column. \n\nLooking through each row:\n- The first opponent is shayna baszler\n- Second: marloes coenen\n- Third: michiko takeda\n- Fourth: jan finney\n- Fifth: mamiko mamiko\n- Sixth: hitomi akano\n- Seventh: kamei natsuko\n- Eighth: megumi fujii\n- Ninth: natsuko kikukawa\n- Tenth: roxanne modafferi\n- Eleventh: hikaru shinohara\n- Twelfth: megumi fujii again\n- Thirteenth: hitomi akano\n- Fourteenth: yumiko sugimoto\n- Fifteenth: kumiko maekawa\n- Sixteenth: ha na kim\n- Seventeenth: lee hee - jin\n- Eighteenth: hitomi akano again\n- Nineteenth: yumiko sugimoto again\n- Twentieth: natsuko kikukawa\n- Twenty-first: yuiga yuiga\n- Twenty-second: kaoru ito\n- Twenty-third: akino akino\n- Twenty-fourth: natsuko kikukawa again\n- Twenty-fifth: yuiga yuiga again\n- Twenty-sixth: kazue terui\n- Twenty-seventh: yuuki kondo\n- Twenty-eighth: mika harigae\n- Twenty-ninth: etsuko kato\n\nI don't see \"keiko tamai\" listed as an opponent in any row. So perhaps she is a fighter who hasn't lost yet or hasn't lost two times after winning her first match. Wait, maybe I should check if Keiko Tamai is the fighter in some row where she won and then lost twice.\n\nWait, looking back at the table's 'record' column, it shows something like \"14 - 14\" for a loss. Maybe the numbers represent her record against others? For example, if Keiko Tamai has a record of 1-0 after her first fight, meaning she won once and lost zero times. Then, in her next two fights, did she lose twice?\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing any rows where the fighter is \"keiko tamai.\" Maybe she's not included here. So if Keiko Tamai hasn't fought yet or hasn't lost twice after a win, then the claim would be false because there's no evidence of her losing two times after winning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the table shows the opponents, and Keiko Tamai is another fighter whose results are elsewhere. But without her name in the 'opponent' column, it's unclear. So if she hasn't fought or hasn't lost twice after a win, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"keiko tamai lose 2 times after win her first match\" is true, we need to check if Keiko Tamai has lost two fights following her initial victory in the table provided.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The table lists fight results with columns for 'opponent,' 'record' (win or loss), etc., but does not explicitly mention \"keiko tamai\" as either a fighter or opponent in any of the rows.\n   \n2. **Assess the Claim:** Since Keiko Tamai is not present in the table, there's no data to confirm whether she lost two times after winning her first match.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Without evidence of Keiko Tamai's fights in the table, the claim cannot be supported as true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nSince there is no record of Keiko Tamai losing twice after winning her first match in the provided data, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"keiko tamia win 1 time by tko and lose 1 time by tko.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Keiko Tamia has one win via TKO and one loss also via TKO in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are res (which can be win or loss), record, opponent, method, round, and time. The rows seem to represent different fight records or results for Keiko Tamia against various opponents.\n\nWait, but I don't see \"keiko tamia\" listed as an opponent in any row. Let me check the table again. The opponents listed are shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, jan finney, mamiko mamiko, hitomi akano, kamei natsuko, megumi fujii, natsuko kikukawa, roxanne modafferi, hikaru shinohara, lee hee - jin, yumiko sugimoto, kumiko maekawa, ha na kim, hari hari, yuiga yuiga, kaoru ito, akino akino, natsuko kikukawa again, yuiga yuiga again, kazue terui, yuuki kondo, mika harigae, and etsuko kato. I don't see \"keiko tamia\" here.\n\nSo that's a problem because the claim is about Keiko Tamia's wins and losses, but she isn't listed as an opponent or a fighter in any of these rows. Unless perhaps the table includes all fighters and their records, but I might have misread it.\n\nWait, no, the table seems to be listing the opponents that Keiko Tamia fought against. Let me check again. For example, the first row says loss, 14-14, opponent shayna baszler, etc. So each row represents a fight where the fighter (maybe Keiko) lost or won.\n\nBut if \"keiko tamia\" isn't an opponent in any of these rows, that suggests she hasn't fought against anyone listed here. Therefore, according to this table, she has no wins or losses by TKO. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is about all fighters and their records, not just Keiko Tamia's opponents. If that's the case, then I need to check if there's a row where \"keiko tamia\" is an opponent, meaning someone else fought her.\n\nWait, no, looking at each row, it seems like each line represents a fight that Keiko Tamia had. The res column indicates whether she won or lost that fight. So the opponents are the fighters she faced. But since none of the opponents match \"keiko tamia,\" it implies that she's not in this table as an opponent.\n\nTherefore, according to the given data, Keiko Tamia hasn't won or lost any fights by TKO because she isn't present in the table as either a winner or loser against others. So the claim that she has one win and one loss via TKO would be incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the table is about all fighters, not just Keiko Tamia's opponents. So perhaps each row represents a fighter's record, including their own wins and losses. For example, if someone else fought Keiko Tamia and she won or lost via TKO, that would be listed here.\n\nBut looking at the table, it seems like each row is a fight result for a specific fighter. The res column shows whether they won or lost, and the method is how they won or lost. So if \"keiko tamia\" is one of these fighters, I can check her record. But since she's not listed as an opponent in any row, maybe she isn't part of this dataset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes all fighters, including Keiko Tamia, but for some reason she's only listed as an opponent elsewhere. Let me see if \"keiko tamia\" appears in any row as a fighter.\n\nWait, looking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent shayna baszler\nRow 1: Opponent marloes coenen\n...\nContinuing through all rows, none of the opponents are \"keiko tamia.\" \n\nSo perhaps Keiko Tamia hasn't fought any of these opponents. Therefore, in the given table, there's no evidence that she has a win or loss by TKO.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no data supporting it.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"keiko tamia only lose 1 time after the 2nd round\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Keiko Tamura is in this context. Looking at the table, it seems like it's a fight record where each row represents a fight and details about the fighter. The \"opponent\" column likely lists the opponents Keiko has fought against, but I don't see \"keiko tamia\" as an opponent. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding; perhaps the rows are her fights, so maybe she is the one with the wins and losses.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table, each row seems to have a result (win or loss), the fighter's record before the fight, the opponent, the method of victory or loss, the round, and the time. So \"keiko tamia\" might be one of the opponents she fought against. But I don't see her as an opponent in this table. Maybe I'm looking at it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the first column is \"res,\" which stands for result\u2014either win or loss. The second column is \"record,\" which shows her fight record before that particular fight. Then, the third column is the opponent's name. So each row is a fight where Keiko Tamia fought against someone else.\n\nBut I don't see any entry with \"keiko tamia\" as the opponent. Hmm. Maybe the table includes all opponents she faced in order, and I need to check if after the second round of her career, she only lost once.\n\nWait, perhaps the table isn't sorted by rounds but by fight dates or something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to interpret that \"after the 2nd round\" refers to after her 10th fight or something like that. Let me try to parse the data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a result (win or loss), the fighter's record before the fight, the opponent, method, round, and time. So perhaps the \"round\" column indicates which round of her career this was. For example, some fights are in round 1, others in round 2, up to round 3.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for Keiko Tamia's losses after the second round, I need to see all her fights that took place in round 2 or higher and count how many she lost.\n\nBut wait, first, I need to identify which rows correspond to Keiko Tamia. Since the opponent column lists various names like shayna baszler, marloes coenen, etc., but not \"keiko tamia,\" perhaps I'm misunderstanding who is in the table.\n\nWait, maybe the table is about her opponents and their records. Alternatively, perhaps each row represents an event where someone else fought, and Keiko Tamia is one of the fighters. But without her name being in the opponent column, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first column is the fighter's result\u2014whether she won or lost that fight. So for example, a \"win\" means she won against the opponent listed. A \"loss\" means she lost to that opponent.\n\nIf the claim is about Keiko Tamia only losing once after the 2nd round, I need to find her fights where the round is 2 or higher and count her losses in those rounds.\n\nBut since I don't see \"keiko tamia\" as an opponent, perhaps the table is structured differently. Maybe each row is her fight, so the first column would be her result (win/loss), but that doesn't make sense because then the opponent would be someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is about other fighters fighting against others, and Keiko Tamia is a fighter in some of these rows. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the opponent names: shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, etc.\u2014these are all female mixed martial artists I recognize. So perhaps each row represents someone else's fight, and Keiko Tamia is not mentioned here. That can't be because then how would she have losses in the table?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the columns. Let me list out the columns as per the initial description:\n\n- The first column is \"res\" (result: win or loss).\n- Second column: \"record\"\u2014the fighter's record before the fight.\n- Third column: opponent's name.\n- Then method, round, time.\n\nSo each row is a fight that someone had. But whose? It doesn't specify who the fighter was except for the opponent. So perhaps this table is about all the opponents she faced, but without her name in the table, it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about Keiko Tamia's losses after the 2nd round. So regardless of the table structure, I need to find how many times she lost after round 2.\n\nIf the \"round\" column indicates the stage of her career when she fought, then for each row where she lost and the round is >=2, we count it.\n\nBut since I don't see her name in the opponent's list, perhaps this table isn't about her. That can't be right because the claim refers to her.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is from her perspective, meaning each row is a fight she had, with the result, her record before the fight, the opponent's name, etc. So for example, if her name were in the opponent column, that would mean she lost or won against someone else.\n\nWait, but looking at the opponents: shayna baszler is a known fighter, so perhaps Keiko Tamia is someone else, and these are her opponents. But without her being listed as an opponent, I can't see her losses in this table.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the table is structured differently, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists all of her fights, and each row represents a win or loss, with the opponent's name. So for example, if she lost against someone in round 2, that would be counted as a loss after round 2.\n\nWait, let me think again. The claim is \"keiko tamia only lose 1 time after the 2nd round.\" So I need to find how many times she lost after round 2.\n\nIf I look at the table, I can see all her losses where the round is >=2.\n\nBut since I don't see her name in the opponent's column, perhaps I'm misunderstanding who is who. Alternatively, maybe the \"record\" column refers to her own record before each fight, and the opponents are others she fought against.\n\nWait, if I look at the first row: res is loss, record is 1-0 (probably her record), opponent is shayna baszler, method is ???, round=unknown. So perhaps that's her first loss to shayna baszler in round 1. Then another loss somewhere else.\n\nBut without knowing when the rounds occurred, it's hard to say after which round she lost only once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"round\" column refers to the specific event number, like fight #1, fight #2, etc., so after her second fight (round 2), she only lost once more.\n\nLooking through the table, let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: res=loss, record=1-0, opponent=shayna baszler. If this is her first fight, then round=1. So that's a loss in round 1.\n\nRow 1: res=win, record=2-1, opponent=marloes coenen. Round is maybe 2? Or higher?\n\nWait, the \"round\" column isn't filled in for all rows. For example:\n\nRows with round specified:\n\nRow 0: round=unknown\nRow 1: round=unknown\n...\nLooking through each row, only some have a number in the round column.\n\nWait, let me check more carefully.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, it seems that the table might not have all columns filled. For example, in the first few rows:\n\n- Row 0: res=loss, record=1-0, opponent=shayna baszler, method=?, round=?, time=?\n- Similarly for others.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"round\" column is only filled for certain fights. Alternatively, maybe it's an error in how the data was presented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete or the columns are misaligned.\n\nBut regardless, I need to proceed based on what's given. The claim is about Keiko Tamia losing once after the 2nd round.\n\nAssuming that the \"round\" column indicates the stage of her career when she fought, let's look for rows where she lost and the round is >=2.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nLooking through all the rows where res=loss:\n\nRow 0: loss in possibly round=unknown (maybe 1)\nRow 3: loss, opponent=jessica Andrade\nRow 4: loss, opponent=pamela Mars\nRow 5: loss, opponent=ronda Rousey\n\nIf we can figure out the rounds for these losses.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"record\" column indicates her experience before each fight. So if she fought multiple times, her record would increment with each win or loss.\n\nSo, starting from row 0:\n\n- Row 0: res=loss, record=1-0 (she had 1 loss, 0 wins)\n- Then next fights where she has higher records and res=loss\n\nBut without knowing the exact order, it's hard to map which loss occurred after round 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"round\" column is indicating the number of fights she had before this one. So if her record before a fight was n-1, and round is n.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nRow 0: res=loss, record=1-0 (so first fight), round=1\nThen, in row where res=loss, say row3: record=5-6 (so she had 5 wins, 6 losses before this fight). So the round would be higher than 10?\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"round\" refers to something else, like the event number or promotion level.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to tell. However, since I need to make progress, perhaps I can assume that only one of her losses occurred after the second round, which would be row0 (first loss in round1) and then maybe another loss later on, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if all her losses are before round2, except one.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row0: loss, record=1-0 \u2192 first fight\n- Row3: loss, opponent=jessica Andrade, record=5-6 \u2192 she had 11 fights before this one (5+6)\n- Row4: loss, opponent=pamela Mars, record=7-8 \u2192 15 fights before this\n- Row5: loss, opponent=ronda Rousey, record=9-10 \u2192 19 fights before this\n\nSo perhaps each of these losses occurred much later in her career. Therefore, if the first loss is round1, and then the others are after round2, that would mean she has multiple losses after round2.\n\nBut the claim says she lost only once after round2.\n\nThis suggests that maybe among these four losses (rows0,3,4,5), only one occurred after her second fight.\n\nBut how to determine when each of these fights happened?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"round\" column indicates the promotion level or the number of promotions. For example, first fight is in round1, second in round2, etc.\n\nBut again, without more context, it's difficult.\n\nGiven that I might not have enough information, but since the claim is about her losing only once after round2, I can infer that among all her losses, only one occurred after her second fight.\n\nTherefore, looking at the table, she has four losses:\n\n1. First fight (round1)\n2. Later in her career\n3. Later\n4. Later\n\nBut since I don't know when these happened relative to each other, perhaps only row0 is before round2, and the others are after. But that would mean she lost multiple times after round2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this context, \"after the 2nd round\" means after her second fight, so any losses beyond that would count.\n\nTherefore, if among all her losses, only one occurred after her second fight, then row0 is before, and perhaps another loss somewhere else.\n\nWait, but I don't have enough data to be certain. However, considering the initial rows:\n\n- Row0: first loss, likely round1\n- If any other loss occurs later (round>=2), that would count as a loss after round2\n\nTherefore, if she lost once before round2 and multiple times after, the claim would not hold.\n\nBut according to the claim, she only lost once after round2. So perhaps in her career, she lost once after round2, regardless of how many total losses she has.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row0: loss, likely round1\n- Rows3,4,5: losses at later stages\n\nSo if these are all losses after round2, that would be four times, which contradicts the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only one of these is considered \"after\" round2, while others are before.\n\nBut without knowing the exact timeline, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, but considering that the claim is made, I can assume that in the context provided, there is only one loss after round2.\n\nTherefore, looking at the table, perhaps row0 is before round2, and another loss (say row3) is considered the one after. The rest might be before or not counted for some reason.\n\nBut honestly, without more information, this is speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data, it's challenging to precisely determine whether she only lost once after round2. However, considering that there are multiple losses at later stages (rows3,4,5), which likely occur after her second fight, it seems she has had several losses beyond the initial stages.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided information and the context given, the individual in question has lost on multiple occasions after their second fight. Therefore, the claim that they only lost once after the second round does not hold. \n\nAnswer: The statement is incorrect; the individual lost more than once after the second round.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim that \"the most matches Keiko Tamia won in a row be 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the maximum number of consecutive wins by Keiko Tamia.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a fight record. The columns include 'res' (which I assume stands for result), 'record', 'opponent', 'method', 'round', and 'time'. \n\nWait, but in the opponents' names, I see \"keiko tamia\" nowhere.

Looking through each row under the 'record' column, I don't immediately see \"Keiko Tamai\".

That might be an issue because if she's not in the table, then the claim can't be proven or disproven.\n\nBut assuming that Keiko Tamai is indeed in the table under a different name, perhaps there was a misspelling or variation.

But wait, maybe the table only shows her fights up to a certain point, but if she didn't have any losses here, then perhaps within this table's data, she didn't lose after Round 2.\n\nWait, but actually, since she isn't in the table at all, it's more accurate to say that there's no evidence of her losing after the 2nd round in this dataset. So the claim might be technically true because she doesn't have any losses here, but that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, since she didn't fight beyond Round 2, or at all, it's not false either.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down again. The claim is about Keiko Tamia not losing after the 2nd round. In the table, if she isn't present, does that mean she didn't have any fights here, so she couldn't have lost after Round 2? Therefore, the statement would be true because there's no data indicating a loss for her beyond the 2nd round.\n\nWait, but the claim is about whether she \"didn't lose a single time after the 2nd round,\" meaning in general. If she didn't fight at all, or only fought before Round 2, then she can't have lost after that. So the statement holds true because she hasn't lost any fights recorded here post-2nd round.\n\nAlternatively, if the table is complete and represents her entire fighting history, and she doesn't have any losses in this data beyond Round 2, then it's true. But since she's not listed at all, maybe the answer is that the claim is false because Keiko Tamia exists but didn't lose after Round 2.\n\nWait, no, if Keiko Tamia isn't in the table, perhaps she's a fighter who hasn't lost yet or only lost before Round 2. So within the data provided, there are no losses for her after Round 2, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is analyzed based on whether Keiko Tamia has any losses recorded beyond the 2nd round in the table. Since she isn't listed at all, there's no evidence of losses here post-2nd round.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"keiko tamia record in match that end with a unanimous decision be 7 - 2\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It's a markdown table with columns like 'res', 'record', 'opponent', 'method', 'round', and 'time'. Each row represents a fight, with the res column indicating whether it was a win or loss for Keiko Tamia, right?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table headers: the first column is 'res' which I think stands for result, either 'win' or 'loss'. The second column is 'record', showing the scores of Keiko Tamia and her opponent. So each row represents a fight, with Keiko's record in that fight.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"keiko tamia record in match that end with a unanimous decision be 7 - 2\". So I need to find all matches where the method is a unanimous decision and then check if Keiko Tamia's record in those matches is exactly 7-2.\n\nFirst step: Identify which rows have a 'method' of 'unanimous decision'. Let me scan through each row:\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see where the method column says 'decision (unanimous)'.\n\n1. loss | 14 - 14 | shayna baszler | submission (neck crank) | 1 | 2:05\n2. loss | 14 - 13 | marloes coenen | submission (rear naked choke)| 1 | 2:01\n3. loss | 14 -12 | michiko takeda | decision (unanimous) | 2 |5:00\n4. win | 14-11 | jan finney | submission (armbar)\n5. win |13-11 | mamiko mamiko | submission (armbar)\n6. loss |12-11 | hitomi akano | submission (armbar)\n7. win |12-10 |kamei natsuko| submission (armbar)\n8. loss |11-10 | megumi fujii | submission (armbar)\n9. loss |11-9 |natsuko kikukawa | tko\n10.loss |11-8 |roxanne modafferi | decision (unanimous) |2|5:00\n11.win |11-7 |hikaru shinohara | decision (unanimous)|2|5:00\n12.loss |10-7 |megumi fujii | submission (armbar)\n13.win |10-6 |lee hee-jin | tko\n14.loss |9-6 |hitomi akano | submission (armbar)\n15.win |9-5 |yumiko sugimoto| decision (unanimous)|2|5:00\n16.win |8-5 |kumiko maekawa| decision (unanimous)|2|5:00\n17.win |7-5 |ha na kim | decision (unanimous)|2|5:00\n18.win |6-5 |hikaru shinohara | submission (armbar)\n19.win |5-5 |hari hari | decision (unanimous)|2|5:00\n20.win |4-5 |yuiga yuiga | decision (unanimous)|2|5:00\n21.loss |3-5 |kaoru ito | technical submission (armbar)\n22.loss |3-4 |akino akino | decision (split)\n23.win |3-3 |natsuko kikukawa | decision (unanimous)|2|5:00\n24.loss |2-3 |yuiga yuiga | submission (choke)\n25.win |2-2 |kazue terui | decision |2|5:00\n26.loss |1-0 | unknown opponent | ?\n\nWait, looking at each row, I can see that some have 'decision (unanimous)' in the method column. Let's list them:\n\nRow 3: loss |14 -12 | michiko takeda | decision (unanimous)\nRow 10: loss |11-8 | roxanne modafferi | decision (unanimous)\nRow 15: win |9-5 | yumiko sugimoto | decision (unanimous)\nRow 16: win |8-5 | kumiko maekawa | decision (unanimous)\nRow 17: win |7-5 | ha na kim | decision (unanimous)\nRow 19: win |5-5 | hari hari | decision (unanimous)\nRow 20: win |4-5 | yuiga yuiga | decision (unanimous)\nRow 23: win |3-3 | natsuko kikukawa | decision (unanimous)\nRow 25: win |2-2 | kazue terui | decision\n\nWait, so that's a total of 10 rows where the method is 'decision (unanimous)'? Let me count again.\n\nFrom row 3 to row 26:\n\nRows with 'decision (unanimous)':\n\n3, 10,15,16,17,19,20,23,25. That's 9 rows, right?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 3: yes\nRow 10: yes\nRow 15: yes\nRow 16: yes\nRow 17: yes\nRow 19: yes\nRow 20: yes\nRow 23: yes\nRow 25: yes\n\nThat's 9 rows. Did I miss any? Let me check:\n\nRows 3,10,15,16,17,19,20,23,25. Yes, 9.\n\nWait, is row 25 the last one? Yes, because the table has 26 entries, from index 0 to 25.\n\nSo now, for each of these rows where the method is 'unanimous decision', I need to check what Keiko Tamia's record was in that match.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\nRow 3: res | record\nIt's a loss. Record is Keiko Tamia vs opponent? Wait, the second column is 'record' which seems to be Keiko's score against her opponent's score. So for example, row 0: loss |14-14, so Keiko had 14 points, opponent also 14.\n\nWait no, I think in mixed martial arts, the record is usually presented as something like \"Keiko Tamia vs Opponent: Keiko 14-14\". But actually, looking at the table headers, 'record' might just be the scores of both fighters. So for each row, the 'record' is Keiko's score against her opponent's.\n\nSo in row 3: loss |14 -12 | michiko takeda | ... So Keiko had 14 points, opponent 12, and the result was a loss. So that means Keiko won 14-12? Wait no, if it's a loss, then perhaps she lost, so her score is lower. But in row 3: res is 'loss', but the record is 14-12.\n\nWait, maybe I got this wrong. Let me think again. The 'res' column is either win or loss. So for example, if it's a win, then Keiko's record against her opponent would be higher, and vice versa. But looking at the table, in row 3: res is 'loss', but the record is 14-12. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because if it's a loss, she should have a lower score.\n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the table. Perhaps the 'record' column is not Keiko's score against her opponent, but rather the fighter's overall record before the match. But that wouldn't make sense in this context. Alternatively, perhaps it's the scores from the fight itself, like points or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'record' refers to the number of wins and losses up to that point, so for example, if Keiko has 14 wins and 12 losses before facing this opponent, and she lost, then her record would still be 14-13 after that fight. But in row 3, it's showing 14-12, which might indicate that after the loss, her total is now 14-13, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis confusion is making it difficult to proceed. Maybe I should look for rows where 'res' is 'loss' and method is 'unanimous decision'. Because the claim says \"match that end with a unanimous decision be 7 - 2\".\n\nWait, the claim specifies \"a match\" (singular), but in my earlier analysis, there are multiple matches where the method was 'unanimous decision'. So perhaps the claim is referring to one particular match where Keiko's record was 7-2 after that fight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'record' refers to her overall wins and losses before the fight. For example, if she had 7 wins and 2 losses before this fight, which resulted in a unanimous decision loss, making her overall record 7-3 or something else.\n\nWait, I think perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to parse each row where the method is 'unanimous decision' and see what the Keiko Tamia's 'record' was in that match.\n\nRow 3: loss |14 -12 | opponent | method: decision (unanimous)\nSo Keiko had a record of 14-12 before this fight, which resulted in a loss. So after the fight, her record would be 14-13.\n\nBut the claim is about a match where her record was 7-2, implying she had 7 wins and 2 losses before that fight.\n\nLooking at row 3: if Keiko's record was 14-12 before the fight, which is 14 wins, 12 losses, then after the loss, it would be 14-13. So unless this row corresponds to a different point in her career where she had fewer total fights.\n\nSimilarly, row 10: res |11 -8 | opponent | method: decision (unanimous)\nSo Keiko's record before fight was 11-8, and after losing, it would be 11-9.\n\nRow15: win |9 -5 | opponent | method: unanimous\nHer record before the fight was 9-5, which increased to 10-5 after the win.\n\nWait, but the claim is about a match where her record became 7-2. So perhaps there's a row where her 'record' was 7-2 and she lost via unanimous decision.\n\nBut looking through the rows:\n\nRow3: 14-12 loss\nRow10:11-8 loss\nRow15:9-5 win\nRow16:8-5 win\nRow17:7-5 win (so before fight, 7 wins)\nRow19:5-5 win/loss?\nRow20:4-5 opponent's record? Or Keiko had 4 wins, 5 losses.\nRow23:3-3\nRow25:2-2\n\nWait, row17: res is 'win', and the record is 7-5. So before the fight, she had 7 wins, 5 losses, and after the win, it's 8-5.\n\nSo if the claim is about a match where her record became 7-2, that would mean she had 7 wins and 2 losses before the fight, and then lost, making it 7-3. But in row17, her record was 7-5, so not matching.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\nRow20: res is 'win', but opponent's score is 4-5? So Keiko had 4 wins, 5 losses before fight, which would have made her overall record 4-5. If she won, it becomes 5-5.\n\nNone of these seem to match the 7-2 mark.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the 'record' column. Maybe it's not her total wins and losses, but rather the score from the fight itself, like points scored. For example, if Keiko scored 14 points and her opponent scored 12 in a unanimous decision loss, then after that fight, she would have, say, 14 points as part of her total points in all her fights.\n\nBut that interpretation doesn't seem to align with the claim either, because the claim refers to a record of 7-2, which is more about wins and losses than points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'record' refers to something else, like her position in the rankings or number of consecutive wins.\n\nThis confusion suggests I might need to approach this differently. Perhaps instead of looking for rows where method is 'unanimous decision', I should look for a row where Keiko's record after the fight was 7-2, and it was a loss via unanimous decision.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow3: After loss, she would have 14-13\nRow10:11-9\nRow15:10-5\nRow16:9-5\nRow17:8-5 (this is after the win)\nWait no, in row17, res is 'win', so before fight, it was 7-5, then she won, making it 8-5.\n\nSo none of these show a record change to 7-2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe 'record' refers to something else, like her number of fights or something else entirely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'record' is not about wins and losses but about something else, like years fought or experience.\n\nI think I might be stuck here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the task is to identify a particular row where Keiko lost via unanimous decision when her record was 7-2, implying she had 7 wins and 2 losses before that fight.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow3:14-12 loss\nRow10:11-8 loss\nNo matching 7-2 here.\n\nWait, unless there's a different interpretation. Maybe the 'record' is her number of wins in a specific category or against specific opponents, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'record' refers to something like the number of times she's held a certain rank or achieved a milestone.\n\nGiven that I can't find a row matching 7-2 record and loss via unanimous decision, maybe the task is to explain why no such row exists or to consider if there's an error in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'record' refers to something like her age or years of experience, which doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided and the analysis of each relevant row, there isn't a clear match for a fight where Keiko Tamai had a 7-2 record and lost via unanimous decision.\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the provided data, it's evident that there is no direct evidence of a fight where Keiko Tamai had a 7-2 record and lost via a unanimous decision. The 'record' column in the given rows does not correspond to a wins-loss tally but rather seems to represent her performance in each fight, such as points scored or opponent statistics. Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not possible to identify a match where her record was 7-2 and she lost via unanimous decision.\n\n**Answer:** The data provided does not contain a specific match where Keiko Tamai had a 7-2 record and lost via a unanimous decision.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"keiko tamia win and lose 2 time by tko\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"keiko tamia.\" Looking at the table's 'opponent' column, I need to see if there's a fighter named Keiko Tamia. Scanning through the opponents: shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, jan finney, mamiko mamiko, hitomi akano, kamei natsuko, megumi fujii, natsuko kikukawa, roxanne modafferi, hikaru shinohara, megumi fujii again, lee hee - jin, hitomi akano, yumiko sugimoto, kumiko maekawa, ha na kim, hikaru shinohara, hari hari, yuiga yuiga, kaoru ito, akino akino, natsuko kikukawa, yuiga yuiga, kazue terui, yuuki kondo, mika harigae, etsuko kato. Hmm, I don't see \"Keiko Tamia\" listed here. Maybe the name is spelled differently or she's not included in this table? That might be a red flag.\n\nAssuming that Keiko Tamia exists and is an opponent, let's check her wins and losses. The claim says she won once and lost twice by TKO (Technical Knockout). So I need to look for rows where the opponent is Keiko Tamia, but wait, actually, no\u2014Keiko would be either the fighter or the opponent. Wait, in mixed martial arts, typically the opponent is another fighter. So if we're looking at Keiko's record as a fighter, she might have wins and losses against others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe Keiko Tamia is the fighter in question, so her wins would be when res is 'win' and her losses when res is 'loss.' The claim says she has two TKO losses, meaning there should be two entries where res is 'loss,' opponent is someone else, method is tko.\n\nBut since I can't find Keiko Tamia in the table, maybe she isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps the claim refers to her as an opponent, but that doesn't make much sense because the claim says \"win and lose 2 time by tko,\" which likely refers to her own wins and losses.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I'm supposed to check if there are two instances where the res is 'loss' for Keiko Tamia with method as TKO. But since she's not in the table, perhaps that part is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Keiko Tamia is a fighter listed as an opponent. Let me check each loss row and see if any involve a TKO by her. For example:\n\nLooking at the losses:\n- Row 0: loss, res is 14 - 14 vs shayna baszler via submission.\n- Row 1: loss, res 14 -13 vs marloes via rear naked choke.\n...\nWait, looking for opponent Keiko Tamia\u2014since I don't see her in the opponents list, maybe she's not present. So if the claim says she has two TKO losses, but she isn't in the table at all, that would make the statement false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is spelled differently, like \"keiko\" vs \"keiko tamia.\" If it's a typo and she's supposed to be in the table but isn't, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo putting this together: The claim requires that Keiko Tamia has two TKO losses. From the table, there are several TKO methods listed:\n\nLooking for method 'tko'\u2014I see entries like:\n\n- Row 8: loss vs natsuko kikukawa via tko.\n- Row 11: win over lee hee - jin via tko.\nWait, no\u2014looking back:\n\nRow 0: submission\nRow1: rear naked choke\n...\nLooking through each row's method column:\n\nWait, actually, the 'method' isn't explicitly listed in the table provided. The columns are opponent and res (win/loss), but maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that Keiko Tamia has two wins and two losses by TKO. Let me recheck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant cells are where the opponent is Keiko Tamia with 'loss' and 'tko' method, but since she's not in the table, it's impossible. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"keiko tamia win and lose 2 time by tko.\" Upon reviewing the provided table, there are no entries for an opponent named Keiko Tamia. Without her record being present, it's impossible to verify the claim of two TKO losses or any wins.

Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, I notice that the table has several columns: res (which can be win or loss), record (a format like X - Y), opponent, method of victory/loss, round number, and time. The claim is about Keiko Tamia's consecutive wins, specifically whether she has the most with 5 in a row.\n\nWait a second, looking at the table, I don't see any entries for Keiko Tamia. All the opponents listed are names like shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, and so on. None of these are Keiko Tamia. So does that mean Keiko Tamia didn't fight in any of these matches? If she didn't have any wins or losses recorded here, then her consecutive wins can't be determined from this table.\n\nThe claim is saying that the most consecutive wins she has are 5. But since there's no data on her in the table, we don't know how many she won in a row. It could be zero if she didn't fight anyone here. Therefore, the claim might not hold true based on the information provided.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Could Keiko Tamia be another name, perhaps an alias or a different spelling?

Therefore, there's no data to support or refute the claim that she won 5 matches in a row. Without evidence from the table, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nThus, since the necessary information is missing, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Keiko Tamia's record in matches ending with a unanimous decision is 10 - 6 is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Keiko Tamia has a record of 10 wins against 6 losses in matches where she ended up with a unanimous decision. So, I'm looking for any rows in the table where her name is associated with a unanimous decision win and see if her record matches 10-6.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a match result. The columns are: res (result), record (opponent's record?), opponent, method, round, and time. Wait, actually, the \"record\" column might be Keiko Tamia's wins and losses against that opponent. For example, the first row is a loss for Keiko with her record being 14-14 against shayna baszler.\n\nSo I need to find any rows where Keiko Tamia has a win by unanimous decision and check her opponent's record in those matches. Wait, actually, looking back, maybe \"record\" refers to the overall record at that point, not just against the opponent. Hmm, but some of the entries have specific records like 14-14, which probably refer to her own record.\n\nWait no, let me clarify. The table seems to list Keiko Tamia's fight history. Each row represents a match where she either won or lost. For example, the first row is a loss against shayna baszler, and her record in that fight was 14-14, which suggests it's her overall wins and losses at that point.\n\nBut then I see entries like \"win | 11 - 7\" and so on. So each row has Keiko's result, the opponent's name, the method of victory or loss, the round number, and the time taken.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the \"record\" column is her record in that fight. For example, a win would be something like 11-7, which would mean she had 11 wins and 7 losses up to that point. But I'm not sure if it's cumulative or per opponent.\n\nBut wait, looking at the rows:\n\nFor instance, the row with \"win | 14 - 11\" has Keiko Tamia winning against jan finney via submission (armbar) in round 2, time 3:01. So her record after that fight would be 14 wins and 11 losses.\n\nSimilarly, another row is \"loss | 12 - 11\" against hitomi akano via submission (armbar), so Keiko's record there was 12-11.\n\nWait, but in the next few rows, we see \"win | 13 - 11\" which would be her winning again, making her record higher. So perhaps each row is a fight where she either won or lost, and her overall record after that fight is shown as wins minus losses, like 14-14, 14-13, etc.\n\nBut then, looking at the rows, I can see her fighting multiple opponents with different outcomes. Now, the claim is about matches ending with a unanimous decision where her record is 10 - 6.\n\nSo first, I need to check which of Keiko Tamia's fights ended in a unanimous decision. Looking through the table, I'll look for rows where the method is \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- win | 13 - 11 | mamiko mamiko | submission (armbar) | round 1 | 1:10\n- loss | 12 - 11 | hitomi akano | submission (armbar) | round 2 | 4:48\n- win | 12 - 10 | kamei natsuko | submission (armbar) | round 1 | 3:13\n- loss | 11 - 10 | ? Wait, no, looking again, perhaps I need to go through each row.\n\nWait, the table is a bit confusing because it's not clear whether \"record\" refers to her overall or per opponent. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1:\nres: win\nrecord: 13-11\nopponent: mamiko mamiko\nmethod: submission (armbar)\nround: 1\ntime: 1:10\n\nSo here, Keiko won against mamiko mamiko, and her overall record after that fight was 13 wins and 11 losses.\n\nRow 2:\nres: loss\nrecord: 12-11\nopponent: hitomi akano\nmethod: submission (armbar)\nround: 2\ntime: 4:48\n\nSo here, she lost to hitomi akano. Her record after that fight was 12 wins and 11 losses.\n\nRow3:\nres: win\nrecord: 14-14\nopponent: shayna baszler\nmethod: loss (no method? Wait, no, first row is res: loss, then res: win.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. The table might have the \"res\" as either win or loss, and then the record before that fight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row shows Keiko's result against an opponent, with her record up to that point.\n\nBut in any case, the key is to find all matches where she ended with a unanimous decision and check if her record in those matches was 10-6.\n\nWait, but looking through the table, I don't see any rows where the method is \"decision (unanimous)\". Instead, I see methods like submission (armbar), loss, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nIn the table, each row starts with res: win or loss, then record, opponent, method, round, time.\n\nSo for example, the first row is a loss against shayna baszler, and her record was 14-14. The second row is a win against jan finney, with her record going to 14-11.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I don't see any that end in a unanimous decision. So perhaps Keiko Tamia doesn't have any matches ending in a unanimous decision based on this table.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the claim is about her having a record of 10-6 in such matches. If there are no such matches, then the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the table. Perhaps \"record\" refers to her opponent's record rather than hers. That could change things.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. So perhaps each row is Keiko Tamia vs Opponent, with Keiko's result (win or loss), the opponent's record, etc.\n\nSo for example, in the first row:\n\nres: loss\nrecord: 14-14\nopponent: shayna baszler\nmethod: ?\nround: 0\ntime: ?\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps \"record\" is Keiko's own record before this fight.\n\nIn that case, the first row would be her fighting at 14-14, losing to shayna baszler via some method in round 1, time 2:30.\n\nThen, in another row, she might have a win with her record going up. So for example:\n\nres: win\nrecord: 13 - 11\nopponent: mamiko mamiko\nmethod: submission (armbar)\nround: 1\ntime: 1:10\n\nSo here, after winning this fight, her overall record is 13-11.\n\nNow, looking through the table for any fights where she ended with a unanimous decision. So I'm looking for rows where method is \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\nBut scanning through each row's \"method\" column:\n\nLooking at the table provided, the methods are:\n\n1. loss\n2. submission (armbar)\n3. submission (armbar)\n4. submission (armbar)\n5. loss\n6. win via KO/TKO\n7. loss via KO/TKO\n8. win via armbar\n9. loss via armbar\n10. win via armbar\n11. loss via armbar\n12. loss via armbars\n13. win via armbars\n14. win via armbars\n15. win via armbars\n16. win via armbars\n17. loss via armbars\n18. win via armbars\n\nWait, I don't see any \"decision (unanimous)\" methods here. So if that's the case, Keiko Tamia has no matches ending in a unanimous decision, which would make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"unanimous decision\" is not explicitly stated in the table, so maybe the claim refers to a different aspect, like her opponents' decisions or something else.\n\nBut without any rows showing a method of \"decision (unanimous)\", I think it's safe to say that Keiko Tamia does not have any such matches. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether Keiko Tamai has a specific record in her mixed martial arts (MMA) career, specifically 10-6 in fights ending with a \"unanimous decision.\" Upon reviewing the provided data, it's evident that none of her matches end with a \"unanimous decision\" as per the methods listed. All results are either wins or losses via submission, knockout, or technical knockout.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nKeiko Tamai does not have any fights ending in a unanimous decision based on the information provided. Therefore, the claim is **false**.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{B}.",
