    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table in markdown format, and it has several columns: round, overall, player name, position, and school/club team. Each row represents a different pick in the draft, I assume.\n\nThe claim is specifically about players drafted from Tennessee State with a rank lower than 261. So my task is to find if any such player exists in the table where their overall rank (which seems to be their draft position) is below 261 and they are from Tennessee State.\n\nLooking at the 'school/club team' column, I see several entries: houston, wisconsin, oklahoma, kentucky, colorado, usc, lsu, minnesota, texas a&m, san diego state, duke, mississippi, tennessee state, nebraska, tulane. \n\nNow, focusing on Tennessee State, I can scan through each row to see if any player is from there with an overall rank less than 261.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Round 10, Overall 261: John Henry Smith from Tennessee State. His overall rank is exactly 261. The claim says \"lower than 261,\" so this one doesn't count since it's not lower.\n  \nI don't see any other players from Tennessee State in the table. The next row is Round 11 with Nebraska, then Round 12 with Tulane.\n\nSo, there are no players from Tennessee State with a rank below 261 in this table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because it states there's none, and indeed, none exist here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are no players from Tennessee State with a draft rank lower than 261 in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
