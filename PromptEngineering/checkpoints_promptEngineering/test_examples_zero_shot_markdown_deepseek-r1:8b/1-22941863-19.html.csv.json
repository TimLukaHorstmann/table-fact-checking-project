    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"stage 3 point classification winner be \u00f3scar freire\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in stage 3, the winner of the points classification is \u00d3scar Freire. So I need to check two things: which stage corresponds to \"stage 3\" and whether the point classification winner for that stage is indeed \u00d3scar Freire.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different stage, from 1 to 9. Each column in the table seems to represent a different classification: general, mountains, points, sprints, team, etc. The claim specifically mentions \"point classification\" and \"stage 3.\"\n\nSo I should look for the row where stage is 3 and check the winner of the points classification for that stage.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Stage 1: Points classification winner is Fabian Cancellara\n- Stage 2: Points classification winner is Fabian Cancellara\n- Stage 3: Let's find it. Scanning through, I see that in row 3 (stage 3), the points classification winner is listed as \u00d3scar Freire.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me check again. The table has a column for \"points classification\" and another for \"sprints classification.\" So each row has multiple classifications, including points. For stage 3, which is row 3, the \"points classification\" winner is indeed \u00d3scar Freire.\n\nTherefore, since in stage 3, the point classification winner is \u00d3scar Freire, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim references two things: the stage number (3) and the classification (points). So in row 3, columns \"stage\" and \"points classification.\" Also, it's important to note that the claim mentions \"stage 3 point classification winner,\" so we should include both the stage index and the classification column.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n- Row index 3, column \"points classification\"\n- Also, perhaps the stage number (3) is implied by the row index, but since the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table, I think the main cells are for the points classification at stage 3 and verifying the winner.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify: The claim is about stage 3's point classification winner. So in the table, that would be row 3 (stage 3) and column \"points classification,\" which has \u00d3scar Freire as the winner. Additionally, since the claim specifies \"stage 3\", we need to check that it's indeed stage 3, so the row index is 3.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 3 (stage 3)\n- Column \"points classification\" with value \u00d3scar Freire\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include both the stage number (row index) and the specific classification column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that in stage 9, the team classification is held by \"team saxo bank\". So, my task is to check if this information matches the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: stage, winner, general classification, mountains classification, points classification, sprints classification, and team classification. Each row represents a different stage (from 1 to 9).\n\nSince the claim is specifically about \"stage 9\", I'll focus on row 9 of the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Stage 1: Team Saxo Bank\n- Stage 2: Team Saxo Bank\n- ...\n- Stage 8: Team Saxo Bank\n- Stage 9: Team Saxo Bank\n\nYes, in stage 9, the team classification is indeed \"team saxo bank\". \n\nBut I should also verify that the claim correctly references the right column. The claim mentions \"team classification\", which corresponds to the \"team classification\" column in each row. So, it's not about other classifications like points or sprints.\n\nTherefore, all conditions are met: stage 9 has \"team saxo bank\" in the team classification column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team classification\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"michael albasini win stage 5 , with tony martin lead the mountain classification.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. Michael Albasini wins Stage 5.\n2. Tony Martin leads the mountain classification.\n\nI'll need to verify both parts using the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking if Michael Albasini won Stage 5.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a stage number from 1 to 9. The \"winner\" column lists who won each stage. So I should look for the row where stage is 5 and winner is Michael Albasini.\n\nChecking the winners for each stage:\n\n- Stage 1: Fabian Cancellara\n- Stage 2: Bernhard Eisel\n- Stage 3: Mark Cavendish\n- Stage 4: Matti Breschel\n- Stage 5: Michael Albasini\n- Stage 6: Mark Cavendish\n- Stage 7: Kim Kirchen\n- Stage 8: Tony Martin\n- Stage 9: Fabian Cancellara\n\nYes, stage 5 is won by Michael Albasini. So the first part of the claim is correct.\n\nNow for the second part: checking if Tony Martin leads the mountain classification.\n\nThe table has several classifications: general, mountains, points, sprints, and team. I need to look at the \"mountains classification\" column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Stage 1: no award\n- Stage 2: Tony Martin\n- Stage 3: Tony Martin\n- Stage 4: Tony Martin\n- Stage 5: Tony Martin\n- Stage 6: Tony Martin\n- Stage 7: Tony Martin\n- Stage 8: Tony Martin\n- Stage 9: Tony Martin\n\nWait, that can't be right. According to the table, from stage 2 onwards, except for some stages, the mountains classification is awarded to Tony Martin. But in the claim, it's stated that \"tony martin lead the mountain classification.\" So if Tony Martin won the mountains classification in stage 5, then he leads it overall.\n\nBut wait, let me check each row:\n\n- Stage 1: no award\n- Stage 2: tony martin\n- Stage 3: tony martin\n- Stage 4: tony martin\n- Stage 5: tony martin\n- Stage 6: tony martin\n- Stage 7: tony martin\n- Stage 8: tony martin\n- Stage 9: tony martin\n\nSo, from stage 2 onwards, except for stage 1, the mountains classification is always Tony Martin. That means after stage 5, he has been leading it. Therefore, at stage 5, Tony Martin does lead the mountain classification.\n\nWait, but looking back, in each row starting from stage 2, the mountains classification is tony martin. So by stage 5, he's consistently leading that category, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Michael Albasini did win Stage 5, and Tony Martin was leading the mountain classification at that stage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"fabian cancellara win the first stage , with no classification for sprint.\" So, two main points here: Fabian Cancellara won the first stage, and there was no sprint classification in that stage.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each part of the claim. The table has several columns: stage, winner, general classification, mountains classification, points classification, sprints classification, and team classification.\n\nStarting with the first part: Did Fabian Cancellara win the first stage? Let me check row 1 (since stages are numbered starting from 1). In row 1, the winner is listed as \"fabian cancellara.\" So that part checks out.\n\nNow for the second part: Was there no classification for sprint in the first stage. Looking at the sprints classification column in row 1, it says \"no award.\" That means there was no sprint classification awarded, which aligns with the claim stating \"no classification for sprint.\"\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I'm looking at the right columns and rows correctly. Let me confirm each part again.\n\nRow index: The first stage is row 0 in a zero-based system, but since the table starts numbering stages from 1, it's actually row 1 (if we start counting from 1) or row 0 if starting from 0. Wait, no\u2014the table shows \"stage\" as 1 to 9, so the first stage is row 1 in the table. So in the relevant cells, I need to map the stages correctly.\n\nWait, actually, in programming, we often start indices at 0, but here the stages are numbered from 1 to 9. So row_index would correspond accordingly. For example, stage 1 is row 0 if using zero-based indexing, or perhaps the first data row. Wait, looking back, the first row after the headers is stage 1, so in the JSON, we have row_index starting at 0 for stage 1? Or does it start at 1?\n\nWait, no\u2014the table shows \"stage\" as column, then \"stage 1\", \"stage 2\", etc., each on their own rows. So the first data row is stage 1, so row index would be 0. But in the context of the problem, when they refer to row_index, I think it's just the position starting from 0 for the first data row. So stage 1 is row 0, stage 2 is row 1, etc.\n\nSo, for the claim about the first stage, which is stage 1, that would be row 0 in the table.\n\nIn row 0 (stage 1), the \"winner\" column is Fabian Cancellara. So that part of the claim is correct.\n\nNow, the sprints classification in stage 1: looking at row 0's \"sprints classification\" column, it says \"no award.\" That means there was no sprint classification awarded, so the second part of the claim holds.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true. So the overall claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to map this into relevant cells for the JSON output, I need to specify which columns and rows correspond to these verifications.\n\nFor the first part: verifying the winner in stage 1 (row 0) for the \"winner\" column.\n\nFor the second part: verifying that in stage 1 (row 0), the \"sprints classification\" is \"no award.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be two objects:\n\n- One for row 0, column \"winner\"\n- Another for row 0, column \"sprints classification\"\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other columns that might affect this. The general classification in stage 1 is Fabian Cancellara, which doesn't contradict anything. So the only relevant cells needed to verify the claim are the winner and the sprints classification.\n\nTherefore, I should include those two cells in the \"relevant_cells\" list.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data, as Fabian Cancellara won the first stage with no sprint classification awarded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"sprints classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"tony martin be the name of the mountain classification in fabian cancellara victory.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what each part means. The claim mentions two specific names: \"tony martin\" and \"fabian cancellara.\" It's saying that when Fabian Cancellara won a stage, the winner in the mountain classification was named TONY MARTIN.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are multiple stages (from 1 to 9). Each stage has a winner listed under the \"winner\" column and another winner under the \"mountains classification\" column. So for each row, I need to check if when Fabian Cancellara was the overall winner, TONY MARTIN was the mountain classification winner.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Stage 1: Winner is Fabian Cancellara. Mountains classification is \"no award.\" So, not TONY MARTIN.\n2. Stage 2: Winner is Bernhard Eisel. The mountains classification is TONY MARTIN. But since the overall winner isn't Fabian Cancellara here, this doesn't apply to the claim.\n3. Stage 3: Winner is Mark Cavendish. Mountains classification is TONY MARTIN again. Overall winner is Fabian Cancellara? No, it's Mark Cavendish here. So not applicable.\n4. Stage 4: Winner is Matti Breschel. Mountains classification is TONY MARTIN. Again, overall winner isn't Fabian Cancellara.\n5. Stage 5: Winner is Michael Albasini. Mountains classification is Fabian Cancellara, not TONY MARTIN.\n6. Stage 6: Winner is Mark Cavendish. Mountains classification is TONY MARTIN. Overall winner isn't Fabian Cancellara.\n7. Stage 7: Winner is Kim Kirchen. Mountains classification is TONY MARTIN. Still not Fabian as overall winner.\n8. Stage 8: Winner is Tony Martin. Wait, that's the same name as the mountain classification? But in this row, the overall winner is TONY MARTIN, and mountains classification is also TONY MARTIN. So when Fabian Cancellara won (who was the overall winner in some stages), but here it's TONY MARTIN winning both. Wait, no\u2014this row shows Tony Martin as the winner of the stage, not Fabian.\n9. Stage 9: Winner is Fabian Cancellara. Now, let's look at mountains classification for this stage. It's \"fabian cancellara.\" So in this case, when Fabian won the stage, the mountain classification was his own name. But the claim says it should be TONY MARTIN.\n\nWait, that's interesting. In stage 9, overall winner is Fabian Cancellara, and mountains classification is also Fabian. So the claim would say that in Fabian's victory, mountain classification was Tony Martin, but in reality, it was his own name. Therefore, the claim is false because when Fabian won, the mountain classification wasn't TONY MARTIN\u2014it was himself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table. Each row has a stage number and then various classifications: winner, general, mountains, points, sprints, team. So for each stage, there's a specific overall winner and separate winners in other categories like mountains.\n\nSo the claim is specifically looking at when Fabian Cancellara was the overall winner, what was the mountain classification. Let me check all rows where overall winner is Fabian.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Stage 1: Winner is Fabian. Mountains classification is \"no award.\"\n- Stage 9: Winner is Fabian again. Mountains classification is \"fabian cancellara.\"\n\nSo in both cases, when Fabian won, the mountains classification wasn't TONY MARTIN. In stage 1, it was no award, and in stage 9, it's his own name. Therefore, the claim that when Fabian Cancellara won, the mountain classification was TONY MARTIN is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because, in both instances where Fabian Cancellara was the overall winner (stages 1 and 9), the mountains classification was not TONY MARTIN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

In each row, under \"winner\", there's the name of the person who won that stage.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Bernhard Eisel wins when there be no mountain classification or sprint classification\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Bernhard Eisel won a stage (which I think refers to a race stage in a event like Tour de France) specifically when there was no mountain classification and no sprint classification.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: stage, winner, general classification, mountains classification, points classification, sprints classification, and team classification. Each row represents a different stage of the event.\n\nMy task is to check each occurrence where Bernhard Eisel won a stage and see if in those stages, both the mountain classification and sprint classification were not awarded. If at least one such stage exists, then the claim might be TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nSo first, I need to find all the rows where the winner is Bernhard Eisel. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 2: Winner is Bernhard Eisel.\n- No other rows have Bernhard Eisel as the winner.\n\nSo there's only one stage where he won, which is stage 2.\n\nNow, I need to check for this stage (stage 2), what are the values in \"mountains classification\" and \"sprints classification\". \n\nLooking at row 2:\n- Mountains classification: tony martin\n- Sprints classification: fabian cancellara\n\nWait, so for stage 2, Bernhard Eisel won. The mountains classification was awarded to Tony Martin, and the sprints classification was awarded to Fabian Cancellara. That means in this stage, both classifications were not \"no award\". Therefore, there's no stage where Bernhard Eisel won with both classifications being 'no award'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's stating that whenever there is no mountain classification OR sprint classification, then Bernhard Eisel wins. But in stage 2, both classifications exist (they are awarded to someone), so it doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the condition: The claim says Bernhard Eisel wins when there is NO mountain classification OR NO sprint classification. So either one or both are not awarded.\n\nLooking at the table, let me check each of Bernhard Eisel's stages (only stage 2) to see if in that stage, either mountains or sprints classifications were not awarded.\n\nIn stage 2:\n- Mountains classification: tony martin (so it was awarded)\n- Sprints classification: fabian cancellara (also awarded)\n\nThus, both classifications were present. Therefore, the condition for the claim isn't met here because there's no case where either of those is 'no award'.\n\nWait, but let me check all stages to see if Bernhard Eisel ever won when either mountain or sprint was not awarded.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\n- Row 1: Winner is Fabian Cancellara. Mountains classification is 'no award', sprints classification is also 'no award'. So in this stage, both are no award. But the winner isn't Bernhard Eisel, it's Fabian Cancellara.\n- Rows 3,4,5,6,7,8,9: Winners vary; none are Bernhard Eisel except row 2.\n\nSo, for Bernhard Eisel (row 2), both classifications were awarded. Therefore, there is no stage where he won with either classification being 'no award'.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because there's no instance where Bernhard Eisel won a stage when both mountain and sprint classifications were not awarded. Actually, in his only win, both were awarded.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if it's possible that one of them is 'no award'. So for example, in stage 2: mountains classification was tony martin, so awarded; sprints was fabian cancellara, so awarded. Therefore, neither was 'no award'.\n\nIn any case, since Bernhard Eisel only won once and both classifications were present, the claim isn't supported.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"Bernhard Eisel wins when there be no mountain classification or sprint classification,\" we check each of Bernhard Eisel's victories in the table. In stage 2, he won with both classifications awarded. Since no stage meets the condition where either classification is 'no award,' the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"sprints classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Hmm, the table shows stages starting from 1, so row 1 corresponds to stage 1, row 2 to stage 2, etc. So, stage 6 would be row 6.\n\nLooking at row 6, points classification is \"mark cavendish,\" not \"\u00f3scar freire.\" That seems clear. Therefore, the claim is false because the name listed in points classification for stage 6 is different from what's stated.\n\nWait another thought: sometimes in tables, especially if there are multiple classifications, maybe I'm confusing the columns. Let me ensure that I'm looking at the correct column for points classification. The table lists \"points classification\" as one of its columns, so yes, it's directly under each row. So stage 6 has mark cavendish in points classification.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the name doesn't match.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the \"points classification\" for stage 6. The table shows \"mark cavendish,\" not \"\u00f3scar freire.\" Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is saying that none of the team classifications in the table are named \"team saxo bank.\" Hmm, let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there's a column called \"team classification\" with values under it. Let me go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 1: Team classification is \"team saxo bank.\"\nRow 2: Same as row 1.\nRow 3: Still \"team saxo bank.\"\nThis pattern continues for rows 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as well. Then in row 9, it's again \"team saxo bank.\"\n\nSo every single team classification entry is \"team saxo bank.\" The claim states that none of them should be this name, but clearly, they all are. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Since each row has a \"team classification\" cell and the value is \"team saxo bank,\" all those cells are relevant. There are 9 rows in total, so each from row_index 0 to 8 should be included.\n\nSo putting it together, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim isn't true, and the relevant_cells list includes all team classification entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"team classification\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"point classification name.\" Looking at the table, there's a column labeled \"points classification.\" So this refers to the winner in that specific category for stage 2.\n\nNext, it says \"\u00f3scar freire\" should be the winner. I'll need to check who won in the points classification for stage 2. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a stage from 1 to 9. The second row (stage 2) has the following data: winner is bernhard eisel, and under \"points classification,\" it says fabian cancellara.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So in stage 2, the points classification winner was fabian cancellara, not \u00f3scar freire. That means the claim is incorrect because the person named is different from who actually won that category in stage 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u00f3scar freire\" won the points classification in stage 2. However, according to the table, the winner of the points classification in stage 2 was \"fabian cancellara.\" Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points classification\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"fabian cancellara be the winner when the sprint classification have no award in stage 9.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which cells are relevant to verify this claim. The key parts of the claim are:\n1. Fabian Cancellara is the winner.\n2. In that stage (stage 9), the sprint classification has no award.\n\nSo, I need to find the row for stage 9 and check both the \"winner\" column and the \"sprints classification\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, stage 9 corresponds to row_index 8 because in the markdown table, the stages start from 1, so stage 9 is the ninth row. Wait, no, actually, looking at the table provided, it starts with stage 1 as the first row (row_index 0). So stage 9 would be row 8 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\nIn row 8, let's check the \"winner\" column. The winner is listed as Fabian Cancellara, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, check the \"sprints classification\" for stage 9. In that same row, under \"sprints classification,\" it says \"enrico gasparotto.\" Wait, no award? No, in the table, it's specified as \"no award\" only in certain stages like stage 1, but not in stage 9.\n\nWait, I might be misunderstanding. Let me look again. In row 8 (stage 9), the \"sprints classification\" column has \"enrico gasparotto,\" which probably means he won it, so there was an award. The claim says that in stage 9, the sprint classification has no award. But according to the table, there was an award given to Enrico Gasparotto.\n\nSo this contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because in stage 9, Fabian Cancellara did win, but the sprint classification did have an award (to Enrico Gasparotto), not no award.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the \"sprints classification\" column for stage 9. From the table:\n\nStage 9's row (row 8) shows:\n- winner: Fabian Cancellara\n- sprints classification: enrico gasparotto\n\nSo there was an award given to Gasparotto in the sprint classification, meaning that part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are stage 9's \"winner\" and \"sprints classification.\" Since the sprint classification did have an award, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the relevant cells for stage 9. The winner is Fabian Cancellara, but there was an award in the sprint classification.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"sprints classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
