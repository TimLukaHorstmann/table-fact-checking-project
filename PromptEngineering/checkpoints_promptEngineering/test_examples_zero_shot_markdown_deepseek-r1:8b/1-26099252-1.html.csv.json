    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean, release november 27th, 2012, be the stable version of the software.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's referring to a specific browser and its corresponding stable release date. The key points are:\n\n- Version number: 4.2.1\n- Jelly Bean release (probably Android)\n- Release date: November 27th, 2012\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are several browsers listed, including Chrome, Chromium, Internet Explorer, Konqueror, Safari, and an Android browser.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for any that mention \"4.2.1 jelly bean\" or the specific release date of November 27, 2012.\n\nStarting with the Android browser: The \"latest stable release\" is listed as 4.2.1 jelly bean on November 27, 2012. So this row directly mentions both the version and the date in question. This seems to support the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check other browsers for the same version or date. Chromium's latest stable release is noted as n/a, so it doesn't apply here. Google Chrome has a different version (30.0.1599.101) from October 15, 2013, which isn't matching. Internet Explorer and its versions don't have 4.2.1 either. Konqueror's latest stable is 4.11.2 on October 1, 2013, so no match. Safari for iOS and macOS also doesn't have the mentioned version.\n\nSo, only the Android browser row matches both the version and release date specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim holds true based on this table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"latest stable release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"theora\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the android browser for android have a theora version of 2.3 and an h264 version of 3.0.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of this claim correspond to the table data. Let's break down the claim into two main points:\n\n1. The Android browser (specifically for Android) has Theora version 2.3.\n2. The same browser has H.264 version 3.0.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the browser is \"android browser\" and the operating system is \"android.\" Scanning through the table, I see that the first row matches these criteria: it's the Android browser with Android OS.\n\nNext, I check the relevant columns mentioned in the claim. The columns are \"theora\" and \"h264.\" In the table, these are separate columns under their respective names. \n\nFrom the data:\n- Theora version for Android browser is 2.3.\n- H.264 version for Android browser is 3.0.\n\nBoth of these match exactly what the claim states. Therefore, all the necessary information to verify the claim is present in the table, and both conditions are satisfied. So, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are where the row index is 0 and columns \"theora\" and \"h264.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"theora\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Google Chrome supporting both VP8 (WebM) 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) 29.0 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: browser, operating system, latest stable release, and then the video codecs for Theora, H264, VP8 (WebM), and VP9 (WebM). The claim specifically mentions Google Chrome supporting two WebM versions: 6.0 and 29.0.\n\nLooking at the row for Google Chrome in the table, I see that it's listed under \"google chrome.\" The relevant columns here are theora, h264, vp8 (webm), and vp9 (webm). \n\nFor VP8 (WebM): The value is 6.0. So that checks out; Chrome supports VP8 at version 6.0.\n\nNow for VP9 (WebM): According to the table, under \"vp9 (webm),\" Google Chrome has version 29.0. Wait, but in the claim, it's stated as VP9 29.0. That seems correct.\n\nBut I should double-check if there's any confusion or possible mistakes. The column headers are clear: vp8 (webm) and vp9 (webm). So, yes, those are the relevant columns for VP8 and VP9 respectively.\n\nSo both claims in the statement seem to align with the table data. There's no indication that either of these versions isn't supported by Chrome based on the information provided. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"vp8 (webm)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"Konqueror supports only VP8 (WebM) 4.4, but not VP9 (WebM).\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the row corresponding to Konqueror in the table. Scanning down, I see that Konqueror has several columns: latest stable release, theora, h264, vp8 (webm), and vp9 (webm).\n\nStarting with the \"latest stable release\" column for Konqueror, it's listed as 4.11.2 from October 1, 2013. The claim mentions VP8 4.4, so I should check if that matches. Wait, the latest stable release is 4.11.2, which seems newer than 4.4. Hmm, maybe the latest version includes support for VP8, but does it include VP9?\n\nLooking at the \"vp8 (webm)\" column, it's marked as 4.4. That matches what the claim says. Now, checking \"vp9 (webm)\", it says no. So Konqueror doesn't support VP9.\n\nPutting that together: Konqueror has VP8 4.4 but not VP9. The latest stable release is a later version, so maybe they've updated their support. Therefore, the claim seems to align with the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"vp8 (webm)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"when theora be 2.3 and the h264 be 3.0 , the vp8 ( webm ) be r47759.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim refers to. It seems like a conditional statement linking two variables (theora=2.3 and h264=3.0) with another variable (vp8= r47759). \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different browser along with various versions and technologies associated with them. The columns in question here are \"theora\", \"h264\", and \"vp8 (webm)\". \n\nI need to find the rows where both conditions are met: \n1. theora is 2.3\n2. h264 is 3.0\n\nThen, check if vp8 (webm) corresponds to r47759 in that same row.\n\nLet me go through each browser one by one:\n\n- **Android Browser**: Theora is 2.3 and H264 is 3.0. Vp8 is also 2.3. So, for Android, when both conditions are met, the vp8 is not r47759, it's 2.3.\n\n- **Chromium**: Theora is r18297, so condition isn't met here because we're looking for 2.3. \n\n- **Google Chrome**: Theora is 3.0, which doesn't match 2.3, so this row can be ignored.\n\n- **Internet Explorer (Windows)**: Here, Theora is manual install, H264 is 9.0. Doesn't meet the condition because H264 isn't 3.0. \n\n- **Internet Explorer (Windows Phone)**: Theora is no, H264 is 9.0. Doesn't match.\n\n- **Internet Explorer (Windows RT)**: Theora is no, so not applicable.\n\n- **Konqueror**: Theora is 4.4, which doesn't match our condition.\n\n- **Safari (iOS)**: Theora is no, so skip.\n\n- **Safari (macOS X)**: H264 is 3.1, which isn't 3.0. Also, theora is manual install. Doesn't meet conditions.\n\nSo, only the Android Browser row meets both conditions. In that row, vp8 is listed as 2.3, not r47759. \n\nTherefore, when Theora is 2.3 and H264 is 3.0 (which happens in the Android Browser), the corresponding vp8 isn't r47759 but 2.3. Hence, the claim is FALSE because it doesn't hold true for the only matching row.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other rows that might meet both conditions. Looking back, all other browsers either have different Theora or H264 versions when those two are 2.3 and 3.0. So yes, only Android matches, but it doesn't support r47759 for vp8.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of \"no\" in some cells, which likely means that the technology isn't supported by that browser version. So in the case of Android Browser, since both Theora and H264 are 2.3 and 3.0 respectively, but vp8 is not r47759 but a different value, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because the condition stated in the claim isn't met in any relevant row when considering all browsers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"theora\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"vp8 (webm)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"when vp8 (webm) be 6.0 and vp9 (webm) be 29.0, the operating system be window.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns in the table. The claim mentions 'vp8' and 'vp9', which correspond to two columns: 'vp8 (webm)' and 'vp9 (webm)'. It also refers to the 'operating system' column.\n\nI need to find rows where both 'vp8 (webm)' is 6.0 and 'vp9 (webm)' is 29.0. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Android Browser**: vp8 is 2.3, vp9 is no. Doesn't match.\n2. **Chromium**: vp8 is r47759, vp9 is r172738. Not numbers, so skip.\n3. **Google Chrome**: vp8 is 6.0, vp9 is 29.0. Operating system here is 'windows'. So this row matches the claim.\n4. **Internet Explorer** has multiple rows:\n   - IE for Windows: vp8 is manual install, not 6.0. Doesn't match.\n   - IE for Windows Phone: vp8 no, doesn't match.\n   - IE for Windows RT: vp8 no, doesn't match.\n5. **Konqueror**: vp8 is 4.4, vp9 no. Doesn't match.\n6. **Safari**:\n   - iOS: vp8 no, doesn't match.\n   - MacOS X: vp8 manual install, not 6.0.\n\nOnly Google Chrome's Windows row meets both conditions for vp8 and vp9 being 6.0 and 29.0 respectively, and the operating system is 'windows'.

The \"stable version\" is 4.2.1 jelly bean on November 27, 2012.\n2. For this version, h264 should be 9.0 and vp9 (webm) should be \"no.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the rows where these conditions might apply.\n\nStarting with the stable version: In the table, each row corresponds to a different browser. The first row is about Android browsers, then Chromium, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Konqueror, Safari (iOS), and Safari (MacOS X). \n\nThe claim refers to \"4.2.1 jelly bean\" as the stable version. Scanning through the table, I see that under \"latest stable release\" for Android browser it's 4.2.1 jelly bean on November 27, 2012. So that part seems to match.\n\nNext, checking h264: In the same row (Android browser), under the h264 column, it says 3.0. The claim states h264 should be 9.0 here. That doesn't match. So this is a discrepancy.\n\nThen, checking vp9 (webm): According to the table, for Android browser, vp9 is listed as \"no.\" The claim says vp9 should be \"no,\" which matches in this case.\n\nHowever, since h264 isn't 9.0 but 3.0, the overall statement in the claim isn't fully correct.
