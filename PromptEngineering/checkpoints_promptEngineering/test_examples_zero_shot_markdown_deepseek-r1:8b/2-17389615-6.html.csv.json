    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"the venue that be use the most be goebel soccer complex.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the venue used most frequently is Goebel Soccer Complex. So, my task is to check which venues are listed in the table and see if Goebel Soccer Complex appears more than once.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row: Evansville Crimson Giants play football from 1921-1922 at Bosse Field.\n2. Second row: Evansville Vipers play football from 2000-2007 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n3. Third row: Evansville Bluecats play football from 2003-2007 at Roberts Municipal Stadium.\n4. Fourth row: Evansville Express play football from 2004-2005 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n5. Fifth row: Tri-State Titans play football from 2008-2009 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n6. Sixth row: Ohio River Bearcats play football from 2008-2010 at Reitz Bowl, and they have a championship.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times each venue is mentioned.\n\nBosse Field: only once (row 1)\nRoberts Municipal Stadium: only once (row 3)\nReitz Bowl: only once (row 6)\nGoebel Soccer Complex: appears in rows 2, 4, and 5. That's three times.\n\nSo Goebel Soccer Complex is used more than any other venue listed. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because it uses the most venues as Goebel Soccer Complex.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim refers to the 'venue' column and whether it's \"Goebel soccer complex.\" So I should look at each row where the venue is Goebel Soccer Complex.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 2: venue is Goebel Soccer Complex\n- Row 4: same\n- Row 5: same\n\nSo, rows 2, 4, and 5 are relevant. Each of these has the 'venue' column as \"Goebel soccer complex.\"\n\nWait, but the user's example included two cells with row indices and column names. So I need to list all three instances where venue is Goebel Soccer Complex.\n\nBut let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 2: yes\n- Row 4: yes\n- Row 5: yes\n\nSo that's three rows, but the example had two cells. Hmm, maybe I need to include only those that are relevant to verifying the claim, which is about the most used venue.\n\nWait, no, the task isn't to count but to check if the claim is true based on the table. Since Goebel Soccer Complex appears three times, more than any other venue, the claim is TRUE, and all three rows where venue is Goebel are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Goebel Soccer Complex is the most frequently used venue. From the table, it appears in three instances, more than any other venue. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 5 teams with no championship, and only 1 with a championship.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each row of the table to see how many championships each team has and whether they fit into either category mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet's list out all the teams along with their championships:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants - none\n2. Evansville Vipers - none\n3. Evansville Bluecats - none\n4. Evansville Express - none\n5. Tri-State Titans - none\n6. Ohio River Bearcats - gmfl title 2008 (so one championship)\n\nNow, I need to count how many teams have no championships and how many have at least one.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- The first five teams (rows 0-4) all have 'none' for championships.\n- The sixth team has one championship.\n\nSo that's a total of 5 teams with no championships and 1 team with a championship. This matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. Specifically, the relevant columns are \"team\" (to count how many have no championships) and \"championships\" (to verify that only one has a championship).\n\nFor each row, if it's one of the first five teams with 'none' in championships, their team name is relevant as they contribute to the count. The row where championships are not zero also contributes because it shows there's exactly one with a championship.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all rows 0-4 (since they have no championships) and row 5 (since it has a championship). Each of these rows' team names and championships columns are important to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table:\n\n1. **Championships Count**: There is exactly 1 team with a championship (Ohio River Bearcats in row 5).\n2. **Teams Without Championships**: The first five teams have none, totaling 5.\n\nThe claim accurately states this. The relevant cells are those confirming these counts and the single championship.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the event at the reitz bowl take place after the event at bosse field.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see what information it has. The table lists different teams, their sports, the years they played, the venues, and the championships they've won.\n\nThe claim mentions two venues: Reitz Bowl and Bosse Field. So I need to find out which rows correspond to these venues in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row is about Evansville Crimson Giants playing football from 1921-1922 at Bosse Field.\n- The second row is about Evansville Vipers, also football, from 2000-2007 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n- Third row: Evansville Bluecats, football, 2003-2007 at Roberts Municipal Stadium.\n- Fourth row: Evansville Express, football, 2004-2005 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n- Fifth row: Tri-State Titans, football, 2008-2009 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n- Sixth row: Ohio River Bearcats, football, 2008-2010 at Reitz Bowl.\n\nSo the only event at Reitz Bowl is for the Ohio River Bearcats from 2008-2010. The event at Bosse Field is for Evansville Crimson Giants in 1921-1922.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the event at Reitz Bowl took place after the one at Bosse Field. Well, the event at Bosse Field was in 1921-1922, and Reitz Bowl was from 2008-2010. Obviously, 2008 is much later than 1922.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the event at Reitz Bowl happened after the one at Bosse Field.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this verification. The cell for Reitz Bowl is row index 5 (since it's zero-indexed) in the \"venue\" column. For Bosse Field, that's row index 0 in the same column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the ones from row 0 and row 5 under the \"venue\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we compare the years of the events at Reitz Bowl and Bosse Field. The event at Reitz Bowl occurred from 2008 to 2010, which is after the event at Bosse Field in 1921-1922.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"4 of the team have the name evansville in their team name.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if any team names contain \"evansville\". The teams listed are:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants\n2. Evansville Vipers\n3. Evansville Bluecats\n4. Evansville Express\n5. Tri-State Titans\n6. Ohio River Bearcats\n\nI can count how many times \"evansville\" appears in the team names. \n\n- Row 0: Evansville Crimson Giants \u2013 contains \"Evansville\"\n- Row 1: Evansville Vipers \u2013 contains \"Evansville\"\n- Row 2: Evansville Bluecats \u2013 contains \"Evansville\"\n- Row 3: Evansville Express \u2013 contains \"Evansville\"\n\nSo that's four teams right there. Now, looking at the other two:\n\n- Row 4: Tri-State Titans \u2013 does not contain \"evansville\"\n- Row 5: Ohio River Bearcats \u2013 also doesn't have \"evansville\"\n\nWait, so that makes four teams with \"evansville\" in their names. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. Each team name is in the \"team\" column. So I need to find all rows where the \"team\" cell contains \"evansville\". \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: team is Evansville Crimson Giants \u2013 yes\n- Row 1: Evansville Vipers \u2013 yes\n- Row 2: Evansville Bluecats \u2013 yes\n- Row 3: Evansville Express \u2013 yes\n\nSo rows 0, 1, 2, and 3 are relevant.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"the tri - state titans be not the team who win the gmfl title 2008.\" So, it's saying that the Tri-State Titans did NOT win the GMFL Title in 2008. I need to check if this statement is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team with their respective details. The relevant columns here are \"team,\" \"championships,\" and possibly \"venue\" since the venue might be associated with championships.\n\nI'll focus on the \"team\" column to identify which team won the GMFL Title in 2008. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Evansville Crimson Giants: no championships mentioned.\n- Evansville Vipers: none.\n- Evansville Bluecats: none.\n- Evansville Express: none.\n- Tri-State Titans: none.\n- Ohio River Bearcats: listed as having \"gmfl title 2008.\"\n\nWait, that's interesting. The Ohio River Bearcats have the GMFL Title for 2008. That means in 2008, they won it, not the Tri-State Titans.\n\nSo the claim says that the Tri-State Titans did NOT win the title in 2008. Since the data shows that the Ohio River Bearcats are the ones who won, the claim is true because the Titans didn't win it.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for verification. The \"championships\" column seems directly related, as it indicates which team won the title. So I should include that row in the relevant_cells. Additionally, maybe looking at the \"venue\" could help confirm if it's associated with the championship, but since the venue is Reitz Bowl and it's only listed for Ohio River Bearcats, perhaps just the championships column is sufficient.\n\nWait, no, the claim doesn't mention anything about the venue, so focusing on championships makes sense. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the row where \"championships\" is \"gmfl title 2008,\" which is the last row (row_index 5) under the team Ohio River Bearcats.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include that specific row's index and column name.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we check the table for any mention of Tri-State Titans winning the GMFL Title in 2008.

The claim is about whether Bosse Field is the most used venue among all listed teams. To verify this, I need to check how many times each venue appears in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and note down the venues:\n\n1. evansville crimson giants - football - played 1921-1922 - venue: bosse field\n2. evansville vipers - football - 2000-2007 - venue: goebel soccer complex\n3. evansville bluecats - football - 2003-2007 - venue: roberts municipal stadium\n4. evansville express - football - 2004-2005 - venue: goebel soccer complex\n5. tri-state titans - football - 2008-2009 - venue: goebel soccer complex\n6. ohio river bearcats - football - 2008-2010 - venue: reitz bowl, and championships: gmfl title 2008\n\nNow, I'll list the venues with their counts:\n\n- Bosse Field: appears once (row 1)\n- Goebel Soccer Complex: appears three times (rows 2,4,5)\n- Roberts Municipal Stadium: once (row3)\n- Reitz Bowl: once (row6)\n\nSo, Goebel Soccer Complex is used more times than Bosse Field. Therefore, the claim that Bosse Field is the most used venue is FALSE.\n\nI need to provide relevant cells.

The claim says: \"Ohio River Bearcarts be the only team to that do not win a championship.\" Hmm, I think there's a typo in \"Bearcarts\" \u2013 it should probably be \"Bearcats.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row to see if any other teams besides the Ohio River Bearcats have won championships. The last row mentions the Ohio River Bearcats with the championship as \"gmfl title 2008.\" So they did win a championship.\n\nNow, let's go through each team one by one:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants: No championships listed.\n2. Evansville Vipers: None.\n3. Evansville Bluecats: None.\n4. Evansville Express: None.\n5. Tri-State Titans: None.\n6. Ohio River Bearcats: One championship.\n\nThe claim says that the Ohio River Bearcarts (Bearcats) are the only team to not win a championship. But wait, actually, they did win one championship. So the claim is incorrect because it states they didn't win any, but they did. However, I need to check if all other teams have zero championships.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- The first five teams (Crimson Giants, Vipers, Bluecats, Express, Titans) have \"none\" under championships.\n- The sixth team, Bearcats, has one championship.\n\nSo the claim says that Bearcarts are the only ones to not win a championship. But in reality, they did win one, and all others didn't. So actually, all teams except Bearcats did not win any championships. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it suggests Bearcats are the only ones without a championship when in fact they have one.\n\nWait, no.

The key elements in the claim are \"robert municipal stadium\" and \"boose field.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row has a team name, sport, years played, venue, and championships. So, \"venue\" seems like the column that would list the stadiums or fields where events take place.\n\nNext, I need to find which rows have \"robert municipal stadium\" and \"boose field\" as their venues.\n\n- For \"robert municipal stadium,\" I see it's in the row for the team \"evansville bluecats.\" That's row index 2.\n- For \"boose field,\" that's in the first row for the \"evansville crimson giants.\"\n\nNow, the claim is about whether the event at robert municipal stadium took place before the one at boose field. So I need to look at when each team played.\n\nThe \"evansville bluecats\" played from 2003-2007. The \"evansville crimson giants\" played earlier, from 1921-1922. That means the events at robert municipal stadium happened after those at boose field because their playing years are later than 1921-1922.\n\nTherefore, the event at Robert Municipal Stadium did take place before the one at Boose Field? Wait, no, actually, wait: The Crimson Giants were at Boose from 1921-1922, and Bluecats from 2003-2007. So Bluecats are later, meaning their stadium event is after Boose's. So the claim says Robert Municipal took place before Boose Field, but according to the data, it's actually the opposite because Bluecats (Robert) played later than Crimson Giants (Boose). Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n\nWait no, the claim says that Robert's event is before Boose's. But since Robert's event is in 2003-2007 and Boose's is earlier in 1921-1922, then actually Robert's event is after Boose's.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim states: \"There be only 2 teams that have the word 'evansville' in their team name.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to see which teams have 'evansville' in their names. \n\n1. **Row 0:** evensville crimson giants - has 'evansville'.\n2. **Row 1:** evansville vipers - has 'evansville'.\n3. **Row 2:** evansville bluecats - has 'evansville'.\n4. **Row 3:** evansville express - has 'evansville'.\n5. **Row 4:** tri-state titans - does not have 'evansville' in the name.\n6. **Row 5:** ohio river bearcats - does not have 'evansville'.\n\nSo, from this, I can see that there are four teams (rows 0 to 3) with 'evansville' in their names.\n\nThe claim says only two such teams exist, but according to the table, it's actually four. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells, I need to check which columns contain information necessary to verify this claim. The columns are: team, sport, played, venue, championships.\n\nTo confirm the number of teams with 'evansville' in their names, the 'team' column is essential because it lists each team's name. So, the relevant cells are rows 0,1,2,3 under the 'team' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are four teams with \"Evansville\" in their names.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"the evansville viper win the championship at goebel soccer complex.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the team name in the table. There's a row for \"evansville vipers\" under the 'team' column, which matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, the venue mentioned is goebel soccer complex. Checking the table, two teams play here: evansville vipers and tri-state titans. So the venue is correct.\n\nNow, checking for championships. The table shows that none of these teams have won any championships. The only championship listed is under ohio river bearcats in 2008, but that's a different team.\n\nSince the vipers didn't win any championships at goebel soccer complex, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
