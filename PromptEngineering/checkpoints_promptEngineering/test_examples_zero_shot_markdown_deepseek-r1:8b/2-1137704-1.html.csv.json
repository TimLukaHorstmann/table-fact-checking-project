    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on a given table. The claim says: \"There be 3 entrants with the Ferrari 038 305 v12 engine.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. I need to find any rows that mention both \"Ferrari\" and \"038 305 v12 engine.\" Wait, in the table, the column names are a bit specific, so maybe I should check for cells where \"Ferrari\" is mentioned along with \"038.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Scuderia Ferrari: This team uses the Ferrari 038 engine. So that's one entrant.\n2. Scuderia Ferrari again: Same as above, they have the Ferrari 038 v12 engine. That's two so far.\n3. Central Park Venturi Larrousse: They use Lamborghini engines, not Ferrari, so I can ignore this row.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"038 305 v12.\" Hmm, does that mean there's a typo? In the table, it says \"ferrari 038\" and \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12.\" So maybe the correct engine name is just \"038 3.5 v12,\" without the \"305.\"\n\nSo in the table, Scuderia Ferrari has two entries for their cars that use this engine. Is there a third entrant with this engine? Let me check all the rows again.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- The Minardi team uses Lamborghini engines.\n- Ligier Gitanes Blondes uses Renault engines.\n- Other teams like McLaren, Jordan, etc., also don't have Ferrari 038 engines.\n  \nWait, maybe I missed something. The table has multiple rows for each team. For example, Scuderia Ferrari appears once with the 192 and another with the same engine. So maybe that's two entries for Ferrari using the 038 engine.\n\nBut the claim says three entrants. So unless there's a third row where another team uses this engine, which I don't see in the table. All other Ferrari mentions are under Scuderia Ferrari or just Ferrari, but only two rows have the 038 engine.\n\nSo based on that, it seems like only two entrants use the Ferrari 038 engine. Therefore, the claim is false because there aren't three entrants with that engine.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Ferrari\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Ferrari\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
