    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"stanford have a linebacker from lessburg high school\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Stanford has a linebacker who attended Lessburg High School. So, I should look in the table for any player from Lessburg High School playing as a linebacker for Stanford.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details like their position, school, hometown, and college. My focus is on two specific pieces of information: the player's college (which should be Stanford if the claim is true) and the player's high school (which should be Lessburg High School).\n\nI'll scan through each row to find players who went to Lessburg High School and are listed as linebackers for Stanford. \n\nStarting from the top, I see:\n\n- Mario Edwards Jr.: Defensive Line, Ryan HS, Denton, TX \u2192 College: Florida State\n- Ellis McCarthy: Defensive Line, Monrovia HS, CA \u2192 UCLA\n- Noah Spence: Defensive Line, Bishop McDevitt HS, PA \u2192 Ohio State\n- Tommy Schutt: Defensive Line, Glenbard West HS, IL \u2192 Ohio State\n- Darius Hamilton: Defensive Line, Don Bosco Prep, NJ \u2192 Rutgers\n- Vince Biegel: Lineman, Lincoln HS, WI \u2192 Wisconsin\n- Scott Starr: Lineman, Norco HS, CA \u2192 Southern California\n- Noor Davis: Lineman, Lessburg HS, FL \u2192 Stanford\n\nWait a minute, I found someone. Noor Davis is listed as coming from Lessburg High School and his college is Stanford. His position is linebacker.\n\nSo that means the claim is true because there's a player named Noor Davis who is a linebacker from Lessburg High School attending Stanford.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other players from Lessburg HS. Scanning again, only Noor Davis stands out as being from Lessburg, Florida, and playing for Stanford as a linebacker.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"stanford have a linebacker from norco high school\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: It says Stanford has a linebacker who attended Norco High School. So, I need to find in the table any player who plays for Stanford, is a linebacker, and went to Norco High School.\n\nLooking at the table columns, there are several relevant ones: player, position, school, hometown, college. I'll scan each row to see if it matches these criteria.\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. Mario Edwards Jr.: Defensive Line, attended Ryan High School, from Denton, Texas. College is Florida State. Not a linebacker, so irrelevant.\n2. Ellis McCarthy: Defensive Line, Monrovia High School, Monrovia, California. UCLA college. Not a linebacker either.\n3. Noah Spence: Defensive Line, Bishop McDevitt HS, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Ohio State. No.\n4. Tommy Schutt: Defensive Line, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn, Illinois. Ohio State again. Still defensive line.\n5. Darius Hamilton: Defensive Line, Don Bosco Prep, Ramsey, NJ. Rutgers. Not a linebacker.\n6. Vince Biegel: Linebacker, Lincoln HS, Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin. College is Wisconsin. So he's a linebacker, but not from Norco High School. So irrelevant for the claim.\n7. Scott Starr: Linebacker, Norco HS, Norco, CA. College is Southern California (USC). So his school is Norco, position is linebacker, college is USC, not Stanford. So doesn't match the claim.\n8. Noor Davis: Linebacker, Lessburg HS, Leesburg, FL. College is Stanford. Hmm, this is interesting. His school is Lessburg High School, not Norco. So he's a Stanford linebacker but from a different high school.\n9. Shaq Thompson: Defensive Back, Grant Union HS, Sacramento, CA. Washington college. Not a linebacker.\n10. Landon Collins: Defensive Back, Dutchtown HS, Geismar, LA. Alabama college. Not relevant.\n11. Leon McQuay III: Defensive Back, Armwood HS, Seffner, FL. Southern California. No.\n12. Tracy Howard: Defensive Back, Miramar HS, Miramar, FL. Miami (FL). Also not a linebacker.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check each player's position and school:\n\nLooking again for linebackers:\n- Vince Biegel is a linebacker from Lincoln HS, Wisconsin.\n- Scott Starr is a linebacker from Norco HS, CA, but his college is Southern California (USC), not Stanford.\n- Noor Davis is a linebacker from Lessburg HS, FL, college is Stanford.\n\nSo none of the players have both the position as linebacker, attended Norco High School, and their college is Stanford. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. The only Stanford college entries are:\n- Noor Davis: Linebacker, Lessburg HS\n- Tracy Howard: Defensive Back, Miramar HS\n\nSo there's no player in the table who is a linebacker for Stanford from Norco High School.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Stanford has a linebacker from Norco High School. Upon reviewing the table, there are no players listed with all three attributes: position (linebacker), college (Stanford), and school (Norco HS). \n\nAnswering as per instructions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
