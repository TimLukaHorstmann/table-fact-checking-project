    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"asc diaraf lose to stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. I see that it's a markdown table with columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The rows list various teams and their aggregate scores against others.\n\nLooking for \"asc diaraf\" in the team 1 or team 2 columns. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n- Row 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n- Row 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien\n- So, asc diaraf is team 1 in this row.\n\nIn the same row, team 2 is stade malien. The agg column shows the score as 3 - 4. That's aggregate over two legs, I suppose.\n\nNow, looking at the legs: 1st leg is 3-0 for asc diaraf, and the 2nd leg was 0-4. So overall, asc diaraf lost both legs against stade malien. \n\nThe claim says they lost \"in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\" The table's headers mention 'agg' as the aggregate, which likely refers to their performance in that competition. Since the agg shows 3-4 and they lost both legs, it supports the claim.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information; all relevant cells are accounted for.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms asc diaraf's loss against stade malien with a 3-0 and 0-4 in their respective legs. The aggregate reflects this outcome, aligning with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against enugu ranger.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see where \"secteur 6\" and \"enugu rangers\" are mentioned. From the table, I see that in row index 8, team 1 is \"sector 6,\" team 2 is \"enugu rangers.\" So the relevant row is row 8.\n\nNow, looking at the columns: agg, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The claim says secteur 6 lost by 1 against enugu rangers. I need to check if this is reflected in any of these columns for their respective legs.\n\nIn the table, under row 8 (secteur 6 vs. enugu rangers), the agg column shows \"1 - 2,\" which indicates that the score was 1-2 in favor of the opponent. The 1st leg is a draw (1-1), and the second leg shows a loss for secteur 6 by a margin of 1 (0-1). So, looking at the 2nd leg column, it's 0-1, meaning enugu rangers won by 1 goal. \n\nSo, does this mean that in their match, secteur 6 lost by 1? Yes. Therefore, the claim is true because in the second leg, sector 6 lost by a score of 0-1, which is a loss by 1 goal.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything else. The agg column might show the overall result, but since it's 1-2, that also indicates a loss for secteur 6 by 1 goal in aggregate. So both the second leg and the agg columns support the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against enugu ranger\" is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Locate relevant teams**: \"sector 6\" and \"enugu rangers\" are found in row index 8 of the table.\n\n2. **Check match outcome**:\n   - The agg column shows \"1 - 2\", indicating a loss for sector 6.\n   - The second leg (2nd leg) column shows \"0 - 1\", confirming a 1-0 loss by enugu rangers over sector 6.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Both the aggregate and the second leg results confirm that sector 6 lost by 1 goal against enugu rangers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a team named \"young african\" scoring exactly 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. So, my task is to check if this specific score and context are present in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The 'agg' column likely stands for aggregate goals, as it shows numbers like 2-2, 1-3, etc., which are typical in football matches.\n\nNow, I need to search the table for \"young african\" and check if they scored 2 points. Let's scan each row:\n\n1. The first row is about al-merrikh vs. tele sc asmara. No mention of young africans here.\n2. Second row: abaluhya united vs. great olympics. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: asc diaraf vs. stade malien. Still no.\n4. Fourth row: maseru united vs. mmm tamatave. Nope.\n5. Fifth row: as porto novo vs. victoria club mokanda. No match here either.\n6. Sixth row: canon yaound\u00e9 vs. as solidarit\u00e9. Not relevant.\n7. Seventh row: esp\u00e9rance vs. al-ahly (benghazi). Still no.\n8. Eighth row: sector 6 vs. enugu rangers. Doesn't mention young africans.\n9. Ninth row: young africans vs. lavori publici. Here we go, \"young africans\" is team 1.\n\nNow, focusing on this ninth row, let's check the columns:\n\n- 'agg' column shows 2 - 0. So the aggregate score for young africans is 2 points.\n- The opponent, lavori publici, has a different score (0 - 0 in first leg, but the second leg isn't filled in). Wait, the '2nd leg' column for team 1 is 0 - 0.\n\nWait, the claim says they scored 2 points. So looking at the 'agg' column for young africans: it's indeed 2-0 against lavori publici. The aggregate score is 2, which would mean they scored a total of 2 goals, hence 2 points in football terms (assuming one point per goal).\n\nSo this matches exactly with the claim. Therefore, the statement should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to find relevant cells: we need the row where young africans are team1 and the 'agg' column.\n\nIn the table, \"young africans\" is in row 8 (since it's zero-indexed). Let me count:\n\nRow 0: al - merrikh\n...\nRow 8: young africans\n\nYes, so row_index is 8. The columns we need are 'agg' because that's where the score is. So relevant_cells should include both row and column.\n\nWait, no: the 'agg' column shows the total for each team, which includes goals scored by each side. But since the claim is about young africans scoring 2 points, it's important to check if their agg is indeed 2-0.\n\nSo, in the table, team1 is young africans, agg is 2 - 0 (for them). So the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 8\n- column_name: 'agg'\n\nI should only include columns that directly relate. So only the 'agg' column for team1 young africans is needed.\n\nWait, the claim says they scored 2 points in the competition. The 'agg' column here shows their score as 2-0, which means they scored 2 goals and won with a 2-point aggregate.\n\nSo yes, the claim is supported by this row. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is at row_index 8, column_name 'agg'.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}]}",

The claim is: \"as porto novo score no point against the victoria club mokanda.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where Team 1 is \"as porto novo\" and Team 2 is \"victoria club mokanda\". Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara. No.\nRow 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics. No.\nRow 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien. No.\nRow 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave. No.\nRow 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda. Yes, this is the relevant row.\nRow 5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9. No.\nRow 6: esp\u00e9rance vs al - ahly (benghazi). No.\nRow 7: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers. No.\nRow 8: young africans vs lavori publici. No.\n\nSo, only Row 4 is relevant because it's the match between as porto novo and victoria club mokanda.\n\nNow, I need to check the scores in this row. Looking at the 'agg' column, as porto novo has a score of 0 - 3. This means they lost both legs? Wait, no, let me check the '1st leg' and '2nd leg' columns.\n\nIn Row 4:\n- 1st leg: 0 - 1 (as porto novo scored 0, victoria club mokanda scored 1)\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 2 (again, as porto novo lost both legs)\n\nThe claim says \"as porto novo score no point against...\" which means they didn't score any goals. Looking at their scores in the 1st and 2nd legs, they indeed scored 0 goals each time. So, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The row index is 4. The columns are 'team 1' and 'team 2'. Since as porto novo is team 1, their scores in both legs are important to verify that they scored no points.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 4, column '1st leg'\n- Row 4, column '2nd leg'\n\nTherefore, the JSON should include these two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"canon yaound\u00e9 score 5 more points than their opponent.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for canon yaound\u00e9 in the team 1 column to find their row. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh\n- Row 1: abaluhya united\n- Row 2: asc diaraf\n- Row 3: maseru united\n- Row 4: as porto novo\n- Row 5: canon yaound\u00e9\n- Row 6: esp\u00e9rance\n- Row 7: sector 6\n- Row 8: young africans\n\nSo, canon yaound\u00e9 is in row 5. Now, I need to check the relevant columns for that row.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n| team 1          | agg               | team 2                | 1st leg   | 2nd leg   |\n\nEach row has five cells corresponding to these columns. The claim mentions points scored by canon yaound\u00e9 relative to their opponent, so I'm guessing we need to look at the \"agg\" column for both teams.\n\nIn row 5, team 1 is canon yaound\u00e9, and team 2 is as solidarit\u00e9. The agg column for team 1 (canon yaound\u00e9) is 9 - 4. Wait, that seems like a scoreline but with a dash in between. Maybe it's the aggregate goals scored and against.\n\nSo, the \"agg\" column shows the total goals for each team. For canon yaound\u00e9, it's 9 - 4, which likely means they scored 9 goals and conceded 4. Their opponent, as solidarit\u00e9, has an agg of 4 - 2, meaning they scored 4 and conceded 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in the \"agg\" column, it's written as numbers separated by a dash. So for canon yaound\u00e9, 9-4 would mean 9 goals for and 4 against. For their opponent, 4-2: 4 goals for and 2 against.\n\nBut the claim is about scoring more points, which in football usually refers to goals scored minus goals conceded. So for canon yaound\u00e9, it's 9 - 4 = +5 goals (assuming \"agg\" is goals scored minus goals conceded). Their opponent has 4 - 2 = +2 goals.\n\nWait, but the way it's written, \"agg\" might be aggregate goals, not the difference. If that's the case, then we can't directly compute points from the agg column alone because we don't know how many goals each team scored in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"agg\" column represents the score, where the first number is their goals and the second is against. So for canon yaound\u00e9, 9-4 means they scored 9 and conceded 4. Their opponent scored 4 and conceded 2. \n\nBut how does that translate to points? In football, points aren't directly given by goals; it's about wins, draws, etc. Wait, but the \"agg\" column might be indicating something else, perhaps points in the match or aggregate points over two legs.\n\nWait, looking at other rows for context:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara. The agg is 2-2 (5-4 pen), which might mean it's a draw with penalties.\n- Row 1: abaluhya united 1-3 against great olympics, so maybe they lost.\n\nSo perhaps the \"agg\" column represents the overall result of the match, not just goals. For example, if a team has agg as 2-1, maybe it's a win with two goals for and one against.\n\nWait, but in row 5, canon yaound\u00e9's agg is 9-4. So they scored 9 and conceded 4. Their opponent scored 4 and conceded 2. So in terms of points, if each goal counts as a point, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, it could be aggregate goals over two legs.\n\nBut the claim says \"score 5 more points than their opponent.\" If \"points\" here refer to total goals scored by each team, then:\n\nCanon yaound\u00e9: 9 + (4 in defense) = but no, points are typically goals for minus goals against. Wait, maybe it's a goals difference.\n\nIn that case, canon yaound\u00e9 have a goals difference of 9 - 4 = +5. Their opponent has a goals difference of 4 - 2 = +2. So yes, canon yaound\u00e9 have a goals difference of 5 more than their opponent.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about scoring 5 more points, not necessarily goals difference. So if \"points\" here mean total goals scored, then:\n\nCanon yaound\u00e9: 9 (goals for) + 4 (against) = 13 total goals? No, that doesn't make sense because it's their own goals and conceded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"agg\" column is representing points, where each goal is a point. So if a team scored x and conceded y, their total points would be x - y or something else. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at row 5:\n\nTeam 1: canon yaound\u00e9 | agg: 9-4\nTeam 2: as solidarit\u00e9 | agg: 4-2\n\nIf the \"agg\" column is just goals scored minus goals conceded, then canon yaound\u00e9 have a difference of +5, and their opponent has +2. So yes, they have 3 more points (if it's difference), but the claim says 5 more.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering total points over two legs, perhaps each leg gives points based on goals scored.\n\nBut without knowing the exact scoring system used in this table, it's hard to say for sure. However, given that the claim is about scoring 5 more points, and from the agg column, canon yaound\u00e9 have a higher aggregate than their opponent by 5 (9-4 vs 4-2), which would imply a difference of +5.\n\nSo if \"points\" refer to goals difference, then yes, they scored 5 more points. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those that show the aggregated scores for both teams involved in the match between canon yaound\u00e9 and as solidarit\u00e9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"asc diaraf win against stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any matches related to ASC Diaraf and Stade Malien. Let me go row by row.\n\nLooking at the first column, team 1 includes entries like al-merrikh, abaluhya united, asc diaraf, etc. So, ASC Diaraf is indeed a team in the table.\n\nNow, team 2 has several names too, including stade malien. That's another match because Stade Malien is also in the table.\n\nNext, I need to find their matchups in the table. The 'agg' column shows the aggregate score for each match. For ASC Diaraf vs. Stade Malien, I should look through the rows where team1 is ASC Diaraf and team2 is Stade Malien or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: al-merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n- Row 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n- Row 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien \u2192 This is the pair we're looking for.\n- Row 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n- Row 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n- Row 5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9\n- Row 6: esp\u00e9rance vs al-ahly (benghazi)\n- Row 7: sector 6 vs enugu rangers\n- Row 8: young africans vs lavori publici\n\nSo, row 2 has ASC Diaraf as team1 and Stade Malien as team2. Now, checking the 'agg' column for this row is 3 - 4, which indicates that Stade Malien won the aggregate score.\n\nBut wait, the claim says ASC Diaraf won against Stade Malien. If the agg is 3-4, that would mean Stade Malien scored more, so they won. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because Diaraf didn't win.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure if the 'agg' is for aggregate or just the score. The 'agg' column has entries like \"2 - 2 (5 - 4 pen)\", which suggests it's the aggregate, possibly including extra time or penalties. So in row 2, Stade Malien has a higher agg than ASC Diaraf.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me double-check: Team1 is ASC Diaraf, team2 is Stade Malien. The 'agg' column for this row is 3 - 4. So the total score is 3-4 in favor of Stade Malien, meaning they won.\n\nSo the claim that ASC Diaraf won against Stade Malien would be incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to include the row where this match occurs. So row_index is 2, and the columns are 'agg', 'team1', 'team2'.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim mentions that they won against each other in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. But in the table, it's only showing two legs: 1st leg and 2nd leg.\n\nWait, but looking at row 2, the 1st leg is 3-0 for ASC Diaraf, and the 2nd leg is 0-4. So overall, Stade Malien won 4-3 aggregate? Wait, no: team1 is Diaraf with 3-0 in first leg, then 0-4 in second. So total for Diaraf is 3-4 against Stade Malien.\n\nSo the claim that Diaraf won would be false because they lost.\n\nTherefore, I need to list the cells relevant to this. The relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:2 (where the match is)\n- columns: 'team1' as ASC Diaraf, 'team2' as Stade Malien, and 'agg'.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be the three cells in that row.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to include each column where relevant. So for this particular match, all three cells (agg, team1, team2) are relevant because they show the outcome of the match between Diaraf and Stade Malien.\n\nBut perhaps I should list only the specific columns related to verifying the claim. The agg is crucial as it shows the result. So maybe including team1, team2, and agg.\n\nWait, but perhaps 'agg' alone would be sufficient because it's the overall score. However, since the table also includes legs, perhaps all three are relevant.\n\nBut let me think: The claim is about whether Diaraf won against Stade Malien in 1971 African Cup. To check that, I need to see if they played each other and who won.\n\nIn this case, team1 is Diaraf and team2 is Stade Malien, so the match is there. Then 'agg' shows the total score: 3-4, meaning Stade Malien won. So the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index:2 (the row where ASC Diaraf plays Stade Malien)\n- columns: agg, team1, team2.\n\nSo in the JSON, I need to list each cell as an object with row_index and column_name.\n\nSo for example:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team1\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team2\"}\n]\n\nThis way, when someone checks these cells, they can verify that ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien in the aggregate, making the claim false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE and the relevant_cells are those three.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the team 1 column, there's a row for \"young africans.\" That seems relevant.\n\nNext, the claim talks about scoring zero points.

Their columns for the two legs are under \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg.\"\n\nIn the table, under \"young africans,\" the scores are:\n- 1st leg: 2 - 0\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 0\n\nWait, but the claim says they scored zero points. But in their first leg, they scored 2 goals and conceded 0, so that's a 2-0 score. The second leg was 0-0, meaning no goals for either team.\n\nSo in the second leg, yes, they didn't score any goals, but in the first leg, they did score 2. So overall, they scored 2 points (from two goals) in total, not zero.\n\nHmm, but maybe the claim is referring to aggregate points or something else. Wait, in football, the aggregate refers to the total of both legs. So their total is 2-0 + 0-0, which would be 2 goals for and 0 against? Or is it just the sum of each leg?\n\nWait no, the \"agg\" column shows the aggregate score as 2 - 0 (since they scored 2 in the first leg and 0 in the second, total 2). So their aggregate is 2-0, meaning two goals for, zero against.\n\nBut the claim says they scored zero points. That doesn't align because they actually scored two goals in the first leg. Unless \"zero point\" refers to something else, like being disqualified or not winning, but that's different from scoring zero points.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"score zero point.\" In some contexts, a team might score zero points if they didn't win any matches or something. But in football, points are based on goals scored. So if a team scores no goals across both legs, their aggregate would be 0-0. But here, young africans scored two goals in the first leg.\n\nWait, looking again at the table: for \"young africans,\" the agg column is 2 - 0 (5 - 4 pen). So they have 2 goals for and 0 against, but also there's a penalty shootout result. However, the points are based on goals scored, not penalties.\n\nSo in the first leg, young africans scored two goals, which would be considered as two points if we're talking about aggregate points. The second leg was 0-0, so no additional points. So their total is 2 goals for and 0 against.\n\nTherefore, they did score points (two) in the aggregate, not zero. So the claim that they scored zero points would be incorrect. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. The claim is about scoring zero points in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. The table seems to list matches for each team, including young africans against lavori publici.\n\nIn their match:\n- 1st leg: young africans 2 - 0 lavori publici\n- 2nd leg: young africans 0 - 0 lavori publici\n\nSo total goals scored by young africans is 2 + 0 = 2. So they scored two points, not zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the young african score zero point in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is false because according to the table, young africans scored 2 goals in the first leg and none in the second, totaling 2 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"secteur 6 wins against enugu rangers\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should look through the table to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the columns are team1, agg, team2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The claim mentions two teams: secteur 6 and enugu rangers. So I need to locate these in the table.\n\nStarting with team1, there's a row with \"secteur 6\" as team1. In that same row, team2 is \"enugu rangers\". That must be the relevant row because it directly involves both teams mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, checking the columns for this row: 'agg' gives the aggregate result of the match, but since it's a penalty decision (2-2 with 5-4 pen), that's the overall outcome. However, the claim is about secteur 6 winning against enugu rangers. To confirm a win, I should look at the individual legs.\n\nIn the 1st leg, secteur 6 and enugu rangers played each other, with the result being 1-1. In the 2nd leg, the same teams faced off, resulting in a 0-1 loss for secteur 6. \n\nWait, so in the first leg, it was a draw, but in the second leg, secteur 6 lost. So overall, they didn't win both legs; there's a draw and a loss. But maybe the claim is about winning the match as a whole or being crowned champions? Or perhaps it's referring to the aggregate result. However, since 'agg' shows 1-2 in favor of enugu rangers, that means enugu won more points overall, not secteur 6.\n\nBut the claim says \"secteur 6 win agains the enugu ranger\". It might be ambiguous whether it refers to winning the match or just being involved. But based on the data, since enugu rangers have a higher aggregate score and also won the second leg, I don't think secteur 6 won the overall match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about a specific competition or context where they ended up winning despite losing some legs. But in this table, looking at just these two legs, secteur 6 didn't win both; they drew one and lost another.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is FALSE because secteur 6 did not win against enugu rangers in either leg or overall.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The 'agg' column shows the aggregate score as 1-2 for team2 (enugu), meaning enugu won more points. So the aggregate result would mean enugu won, not secteur 6. Therefore, the claim that secteur 6 won against enugu rangers is FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check the row in question: team1 is secteur 6, team2 is enugu, and in both legs, the results are 1-1 and 0-1. So overall, enugu has a higher aggregate score (1-2 vs 3-5 or something? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the table, for row 8: secteur6 is team1, enugu rangers as team2.\n\nLooking at the 'agg' column: it's 1-2. So team2 has higher aggregate.\n\nIn 1st leg: 1-1 draw.\n\nIn 2nd leg: 0-1 loss for secteur6.\n\nSo overall, team2 (enugu) won the match. Therefore, secteur6 did not win against enugu rangers; enugu rangers won. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"secteur 6 wins against enugu rangers\" is false because the aggregate result shows that enugu rangers won with a higher score of 1-2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "as porto novo score 3 point against the victoria club mokanda",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has several columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The claim given is \"as porto novo score 3 point against the victoria club mokanda.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that in a match between As Porto Novo and Victoria Club Mokanda, As Porto Novo scored 3 points. Now, my goal is to check if this statement is supported by the data in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see several rows where \"as porto novo\" is listed as team 1. For example, the fifth row has:\n\n- Team 1: as porto novo\n- Agg: 0 - 3\n- Team 2: victoria club mokanda\n\nSo, in this match, As Porto Novo scored 0 and Victoria Club Mokanda scored 3. That would mean that As Porto Novo didn't score 3 points but instead only 0. However, I should also consider how points or goals are calculated.\n\nWait, the 'agg' column has values like \"2 - 2 (5 - 4 pen)\", which might represent the aggregate score after penalties or some form of extra points. But in this case, for As Porto Novo vs Victoria Club Mokanda, it's simply \"0 - 3\". So the total goals scored by each team are 0 and 3 respectively.\n\nBut does that mean they earned 3 points? In football (soccer), typically, a win gives 3 points. However, in this table, some matches might have different point allocations based on aggregate results or other factors, but looking at the data provided:\n\nFor example, in the row where team 1 is \"as porto novo\" and team 2 is \"victoria club mokanda\", the 'agg' column shows \"0 - 3\". This likely means that As Porto Novo scored 0 goals, Victoria Club Mokanda scored 3 goals. So, if the match resulted in a win for Victoria Club Mokanda, they would have earned 3 points, and As Porto Novo would have earned 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"as porto novo score 3 point against the victoria club mokanda.\" But according to the table, it's the other way around. So As Porto Novo didn't score 3 points; Victoria Club Mokanda did.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The 'agg' column might represent points earned rather than goals. So for instance, in another row like \"al - merrikh\" vs \"tele sc asmara\", the agg is \"2 - 2 (5 - 4 pen)\", which could mean that after penalties, the score was 2-2 but with extra points making it 5-4, so each team gets some points. But in this case, for As Porto Novo and Victoria Club Mokanda, the agg is just \"0 - 3\", no additional notes.\n\nSo if 'agg' is the total points, then As Porto Novo has 0 points, and Victoria Club Mokanda has 3 points. Therefore, As Porto Novo didn't score 3 points; they lost, giving them 0 points.\n\nThus, the claim that \"as porto novo score 3 point against the victoria club mokanda\" is incorrect. It's actually Victoria Club Mokanda who scored 3 points in this match.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking back at the table, the row where team1 is As Porto Novo and team2 is Victoria Club Mokanda is the fifth row (index 5). The columns involved are 'agg' for both teams, but since the claim is about the score by As Porto Novo, I think we need to check their points. So the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For As Porto Novo: row_index 5, column \"agg\" as team1.\n- For Victoria Club Mokanda: row_index 5, column \"agg\" as team2.\n\nWait, but the claim is about As Porto Novo scoring 3 points, so maybe only their 'agg' is relevant. Alternatively, perhaps both teams are involved because it's an aggregate score. So in the JSON, I should list the cells that were checked.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n1. row_index 5, column \"agg\" (for As Porto Novo)\n2. row_index 5, column \"agg\" (for Victoria Club Mokanda)\n\nWait, but each row has only one 'agg' per team, so in this case, for the fifth row, both team1 and team2's 'agg' columns are checked.\n\nSo, the JSON would include two objects: one for team1's agg and one for team2's agg in that row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that As Porto Novo scored 3 points against Victoria Club Mokanda. From the table, in their match, As Porto Novo had 0 points while Victoria Club Mokanda had 3. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is true or false based on the provided markdown table and then identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying: \"canon yaound\u00e9 score zero point against their opponent.\" From this, it seems like the claim is asserting that canon yaound\u00e9 scored zero points in a match against an opponent. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating the row for canon yaound\u00e9. Scanning through the 'team 1' column, I see that the fifth team listed is 'canon yaound\u00e9'. So, their row should be row index 5.\n\nNext, I need to check what each column represents. The columns are: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The 'agg' column likely stands for aggregate score after both legs of the match. \n\nThe claim is about scoring zero points, so I should look at the 'agg' column for canon yaound\u00e9's row. In row 5, under 'agg', the value is '9 - 4'. Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense because if they scored zero points, it should be 0- something or 0 in total. But here, the aggregate score is 9-4, which indicates that canon yaound\u00e9 scored 9 points and their opponent scored 4.\n\nHmm, this seems contradictory to the claim. So, according to the table, canon yaound\u00e9 didn't score zero points; they actually scored nine goals against their opponent in aggregate. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.\n\nNow, considering the instructions for relevant cells: I need to list which specific cells were checked. For canon yaound\u00e9, that's row 5, and the relevant columns would be 'agg' since it shows the total points scored.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because canon yaound\u00e9 didn't score zero points against their opponent as claimed. The relevant cells are in row 5, column 'agg'.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}",
