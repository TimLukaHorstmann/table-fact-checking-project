    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"kellen davis be from michigan state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the table represents and how it relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: there are columns for round, pick, player, position, college, and then some rows that say \"according to official website.\" I assume these last few rows might be headers or footers, but in this case, they seem to repeat across all columns. That's a bit confusing because it breaks the expected row-by-row data structure.\n\nNow, focusing on the players: each row lists a player with their pick number, position, and college. For example, row 1 has Chris Williams from Vanderbilt as an offensive tackle. Then there are multiple entries for different rounds and players, which makes me think this table might be listing draft picks, specifically by round.\n\nThe claim in question is about Kellen Davis being from Michigan State. So I need to check if there's any entry in the table that matches both \"Kellen Davis\" as the player and \"Michigan State\" as the college.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Chris Williams, Vanderbilt \u2013 Not Kellen.\n2. Row 2: Matt Forte, Tulane \u2013 Nope.\n3. Row 3: Earl Bennett, Vanderbilt \u2013 No.\n4. Row 3 again: Marcus Harrison, Arkansas \u2013 Doesn't match.\n5. Row 4: Craig Steltz, LSU \u2013 No.\n6. Row 5: Zack Bowman, Nebraska \u2013 Not him.\n7. Row 5 again: Kellen Davis, Michigan State \u2013 Oh, here we go! This row has Kellen Davis as the player and his college is listed as Michigan State. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but there are two entries for round 5. The first is Zack Bowman from Nebraska, and the second is Kellen Davis from Michigan State. So this directly contradicts any doubts I might have had.\n\nAdditionally, even if there were more entries below, since we already found a matching entry for Kellen Davis from Michigan State in row 5, that's sufficient to support the claim as TRUE.\n\nI should also check the other rows beyond round 7 and the \"according to official website\" rows, but those don't list any player named Kellen Davis. They just repeat the header information, which doesn't add any new data points.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a direct match in the table: row 5 lists Kellen Davis as being from Michigan State.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"all information provided be accord to an official website.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that all the information in the table comes from official websites. So, my task is to check each cell in the table and see if they have values marked as \"according to official website.\"\n\nLooking at the table, there are five columns: round, pick, player, position, and college. The last row has a note that says all cells for that row are according to official websites.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if any cell doesn't match this claim.\n\nStarting with row 1:\n- Round: 1\n- Pick: 14\n- Player: Chris Williams\n- Position: OT\n- College: Vanderbilt\n\nNone of these have \"according to official website,\" but wait, the instruction says that some rows might be filled in a different way. The last row is entirely marked as per the note. So I think the claim refers to all cells being marked with that phrase. Let me check each cell.\n\nLooking at the table, most cells don't have \"according to official website.\" For example, player names like Chris Williams, Matt Forte, etc., are just names without any such note. The only row where this note appears is the last one, but it's a single row and not all rows.\n\nSo, since not every cell in the table has that information, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the wr position be pick in round 3 , pick 70\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two specific things: the round number and the pick number for the Wide Receiver (WR) position. Specifically, it says that in Round 3, Pick 70, a player was picked for the WR position.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if there's an entry where the position is WR, the round is 3, and the pick number is 70. \n\nLet me go through the table row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Round 1, Pick 14, Position OT, College Vanderbilt.\n   - Not WR and not Round 3.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Round 2, Pick 44, Position RB, College Tulane.\n   - Not WR and not Round 3.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Round 3, Pick 70, Position WR, College Vanderbilt.\n   - This matches! The position is WR, the round is 3, and the pick number is 70.\n\nWait a second, but then I notice there's another entry in Row 3: Round 3, Pick 90, Position DT, College Arkansas. So that's not relevant either. \n\nMoving further:\n\n4. **Row 3**: Round 4, Pick 120, Position S, College LSU.\n   - Not WR and not Round 3.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Round 5, Pick 142, Position CB, College Nebraska.\n   - Not relevant.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Round 5, Pick 158, Position TE, College Michigan State.\n   - Doesn't apply.\n\n7. **Rows 6 to 8**: These are all in Round 7 and various positions like DE, OG, LB, OT, WR, etc., but none of these are in Round 3 with Pick 70.\n\nFinally, there's a note at the end stating \"according to official website\" for each row, which seems to be a header or footer rather than data. So, I shouldn't consider those as data rows.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, maybe that last line isn't part of the table but just a note. The actual data stops before that. So, the only relevant row is Row 2 where Round 3, Pick 70 has Position WR.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this row. However, I should check if there are any other rows in Round 3 with Position WR. Let me see:\n\nLooking through all the rows again:\n- Only Row 2 and maybe another? No, Row 3 is DT, so no. So only one occurrence.\n\nSo yes, the claim is correct because there's a player picked in Round 3, Pick 70 for WR position.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"kellen davis be pick number 158 in round 5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific pieces of information: the player's name and their draft pick details. The player's name is \"kellen davis,\" and the draft pick is round 5 with pick number 158.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if there's a row where the player is \"kellen davis\" in round 5 and pick number 158. Each row represents a different draft round, and within each round, multiple picks are listed.\n\nI'll start by examining each round for Round 5. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Round 1, Pick 14 - Chris Williams from Vanderbilt.\n- Row 2: Round 2, Pick 44 - Matt Forte from Tulane.\n- Row 3: Round 3, Pick 70 - Earl Bennett from Vanderbilt.\n- Then there's another row for Round 3, Pick 90 - Marcus Harrison from Arkansas.\n- Continuing down, I see:\n  - Row 4: Round 4, Pick 120 - Craig Steltz from LSU.\n  - Row 5: Round 5, Pick 142 - Zack Bowman from Nebraska.\n  - Another row in Round 5: Pick 158 - Kellen Davis from Michigan State.\n\nSo, in Round 5, there are two entries. The first is Zack Bowman at pick 142, and the second is Kellen Davis at pick 158. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but I also need to check if any of the other rows might have conflicting information or if I missed something. Let me double-check the table again.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Round 1: Picks 14 (Chris Williams), others don't mention Kellen Davis.\n- Round 2: Pick 44 (Matt Forte).\n- Round 3: Picks 70 and 90.\n- Round 4: Pick 120 (Craig Steltz).\n- Round 5: Picks 142 (Zack Bowman) and 158 (Kellen Davis).\n- Then, from Round 7: Picks 208, 222, 243, etc., none of these mention Kellen Davis.\n\nThe last few rows are labeled as \"according to official website,\" which seems to be a footer. So those don't contain player data.\n\nSo, the key cells here would be in Row 5 and Column \"pick\" with value 158, and also in Row 5 and Column \"player\" with Kellen Davis.\n\nWait, no, actually, the table's columns are round, pick, player, position, college. So each row has all five columns filled out.\n\nSo for Kellen Davis, his row is Round 5, Pick 158, Player: Kellen Davis, Position: TE from Michigan State.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"kellen davis be pick number 158 in round 5\" checks out because that's exactly what's listed in the table. There are no conflicting entries or other Kellens mentioned.\n\nI think I've covered all possibilities. The only relevant cells are where the player is Kellen Davis and the pick is 158 in Round 5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"kellen davis be pick number 158 in round 5\" is true, we check the table for a row with player Kellen Davis in round 5 and pick 158.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Focus on rows where Round is 5.\n2. **Check Players in Round 5:** Within these rows, look for the player named \"Kellen Davis.\"\n3. **Verify Pick Number:** Ensure his position as per the \"pick\" column is 158.\n\nUpon examining Row 5 (since it's the only Round 5 entry with multiple picks), we find:\n- In Round 5, there are two entries: Zack Bowman (Pick 142) and Kellen Davis (Pick 158).\n\nThus, Kellen Davis is indeed selected as Pick 158 in Round 5.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:** The cells confirming this are for Round 5, Player column with \"Kellen Davis,\" and Pick column with 158.",

Let me start by looking at the table and understanding what each column represents.\n\nThe table has columns: round, pick, player, position, and college. Each row seems to represent a draft pick, with details about the player selected, where they were picked, their position, and which college they came from.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on the claim itself: \"pick 14 be from vanderbilt college.\" So, the key parts here are the pick number (14) and the college name (Vanderbilt).\n\nI need to check if there's any row where the 'pick' is 14 and the 'college' is Vanderbilt. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- round: 1\n- pick: 14\n- player: chris williams\n- position: ot\n- college: vanderbilt\n\nThis seems relevant because the pick number matches (14) and the college is Vanderbilt. So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows that might affect this, but since the table might have multiple entries for the same round or pick numbers, I need to make sure.\n\nWait, the last row says \"according to official website\" for all columns, which seems like a footer. So it's probably not part of the data and should be ignored.\n\nNow, looking at other rows:\n- Row 2: pick is 44, college Tulane.\n- Row3: pick70 and pick90, colleges Vanderbilt and Arkansas.\nWait, row3 has two entries for round3? That might mean multiple players picked in round3. So the first one in row3: player Marcus Harrison, position DT, college Arkansas. The second entry in row3 is player Marcus Monk, WR from Arkansas.\n\nSo nothing there related to pick14 or Vanderbilt beyond the first row.\n\nMoving on:\n- Row4: pick120, LSU.\n- Row5: two picks: 142 and 158, Nebraska and Michigan State.\n- Row7 has multiple picks:208,222,243,247. Colleges include Michigan State, Georgia, Oregon State, Ohio State, Arkansas.\n\nSo none of these have a pick number of14 or Vanderbilt college except the first row.\n\nTherefore, there is at least one entry (row0) where pick is 14 and college is Vanderbilt.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in round 1, pick 14 is indeed from Vanderbilt.

Each row represents a draft pick with details about the player. \n\nThe claim mentions \"Kellen Davis\" and \"Oregon State.\" So my goal is to find Kellen Davis in the 'player' column and see which team (college) he's associated with.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- In round 5, pick 142: player is Zack Bowman, college Nebraska.\n- Round 5, pick 158: Player is Kellen Davis.

The rows are numbered starting from 1 to 7, and each row has specific data under these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific details:\n1. The player's name is Marcus Harrison.\n2. He was picked in Round 3, specifically at number 90.\n3. His college is Vanderbilt.\n\nI'll start by searching for Marcus Harrison in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: chris williams\n- Row 2: matt forte\n- Row 3: earl bennett\n- Then I see \"marcus harrison\" in row 4, but wait, no\u2014it's actually in two different rows? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking closely:\n\n- In row 3 (row_index=2), the player is earl bennett.\n- Then row 4 (row_index=3) has \"marcus harrison\" as the player. The pick number here is 90, round 3, college Vanderbilt.

Wait, no\u2014row 4 has \"marcus harrison\" as the player, pick 90, round 3, Vanderbilt.\n\nWait, let me check again.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"in round 7, marcus monk from arkansas be pick number 243.\" So, I'm looking for evidence that in round 7, Marcus Monk from Arkansas was picked as the 243rd overall player.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The columns are Round, Pick, Player, Position, College. Each row corresponds to a specific pick in a specific round. For example, row 1 is round 1, pick 14, player Chris Williams, etc.\n\nSo, I need to check if there's a row where:\n- Round is 7,\n- The player is Marcus Monk,\n- The college is Arkansas,\n- And the pick number is 243.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row in round 7. From the table, I see that for round 7, there are multiple picks listed:\n\n- Pick 208: Ervin Baldwin from Michigan State\n- Pick 222: Chester Adams from Georgia\n- Pick 243: Marcus Monk from Arkansas\n\nWait a minute, yes, here's the row: in round 7, pick 243 is Marcus Monk from Arkansas. So that directly matches the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells to support this. The columns involved are Round (row index 0), Player (row index 2), Position (row index 3), College (row index 4), and Pick (row index 1). Since the claim mentions round, player, college, and pick, I need to include those.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- Row 7 for Round,\n- Column 3 (Player) with Marcus Monk,\n- Column 5 (College) as Arkansas,\n- And column 2 (Pick number 243).\n\nWait, looking at the table structure again. The columns in order are: round (0), pick (1), player (2), position (3), college (4). So, for row 7, which is actually row index 6 because it starts from 0? Wait, no, the first row is row 1, but in the markdown table, the headers start at row 0. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, looking at the markdown table:\n\n| round | pick | player | position | college |\n|:------|:-----|:-------|:---------|:--------|\n| 1     |14    |chris...|ot        |vander...|\n\nSo each subsequent row is a new pick. So, for example, row 0 is round 1, pick 14, etc. But the data starts from round 1 as row 0? Or perhaps the first data row corresponds to round 1. Wait, no: in markdown tables, the header is row 0, then the data rows start at row 1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIn the table provided, the headers are in the first row (row 0), and the data starts from row 1 onwards. So row 1 corresponds to round 1, pick 14, etc.\n\nBut in the claim, it's about round 7. Looking through the table, there are multiple entries for round 7. For example:\n\n- Round 7, pick 208: Ervin Baldwin\n- Round 7, pick 222: Chester Adams\n- Round 7, pick 243: Marcus Monk\n\nBut wait, in the provided table, under \"round\", I see values like 1,2,3,4,5,7, etc. So for round 7, there are multiple picks.\n\nSo, to find the specific row where round is 7, player is Marcus Monk, college is Arkansas, and pick is 243.\n\nLooking at each entry in round 7:\n\n- Pick 208: Ervin Baldwin\n- Pick 222: Chester Adams\n- Pick 243: Marcus Monk\n- Also, there's another pick 247: Kirk Barton, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo the row for Marcus Monk is round 7, pick 243, college Arkansas. That's exactly what the claim says.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The columns we need to check are 'round', 'player', 'college', and 'pick'.\n\nBut in the JSON response, I need to provide a list of objects with row_index (the index in the data rows, starting from 1) and column_name as strings.\n\nSo, for Marcus Monk's row:\n\n- Round is 7: So column 'round' at row 7.\nWait, but how are the rows indexed? The table starts with headers as row 0, then each subsequent row is a data entry. So round 1 is row 1, pick 14, player Chris Williams.\n\nSo, Marcus Monk's row is in round 7, which would be row index 7 (since row 0 is headers). Wait, no: the first data row after headers is round 1 at row 1, so round 7 would be row 7. Yes.\n\nSo, for Marcus Monk:\n\n- Row index is 7.\n- Columns involved are 'round' (row 7, column 0), 'player' (row 7, column 2), 'college' (row 7, column 4), and 'pick' (row 7, column 1).\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. Row index 7, column 'round'.\n2. Row index 7, column 'pick'.\n3. Row index 7, column 'player'.\n4. Row index 7, column 'college'.\n\nWait, but in the JSON example, they have only two keys: \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So each relevant cell is an object with these.\n\nSo for Marcus Monk's row, we need to list all four columns that are relevant because the claim refers to round, player, college, and pick.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"in round 7, marcus monk from arkansas be pick number 243.\" So it's about round (which is a row), pick number (a column value), player (another column), and college (another column). Therefore, all four cells are relevant: 'round' in that row, 'player', 'college', and 'pick'.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\n[\n  { \"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"round\" },\n  { \"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"player\" },\n  { \"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"college\" },\n  { \"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"pick\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, in the table provided, under round 7, the pick is 243. So yes, all these columns are present.\n\nI think that's correct. Therefore, since all four cells match the claim, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"round\"},{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"player\"},{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"college\"},{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"pick\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"kellen davis, from michigan state, be pick 120 in round 4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it matches the table.\n\nThe name mentioned is Kellen Davis. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see names like Chris Williams, Matt Forte, Earl Bennett, Marcus Harrison, Craig Steltz, Zack Bowman, Kellen Davis, Ervin Baldwin, Chester Adams, Joey Larocque, Kirk Barton, and Marcus Monk. Yes, Kellen Davis is there.\n\nNext, his position is mentioned as \"from michigan state.\" Looking at the 'college' column, I see entries like Vanderbilt, Tulane, Vanderbilt again, LSU, Nebraska, Michigan State, Michigan State again, Michigan State, Ohio State, Arkansas. So, Michigan State is one of the colleges represented by these players.\n\nThe claim also specifies that he was picked in round 4 with pick number 120. Looking at the 'round' column and the 'pick' numbers: I see rounds go up to 7. In round 4, the only pick mentioned is number 120, associated with player Craig Steltz from LSU. Wait, but Kellen Davis isn't listed in round 4.\n\nWait a second, Kellen Davis is in round 5, pick 158. So he wasn't picked in round 4 at all. That means the claim that he was picked in round 4, specifically with pick number 120, is incorrect.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n- The player's name matches.\n- The college matches.\nBut the round and pick numbers don't match for Kellen Davis; he's in a different round and has a higher pick number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Kellen Davis wasn't picked in round 4 by Michigan State. He was selected later in round 5 with a different pick number.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for this verification.\n\nThe columns we looked at were 'round', 'pick', and 'player'. The rows where these players are listed would be relevant. Kellen Davis is in row index 5 (since the first row is 0), so row_index 5, column_name \"player\". Also, in that same row, the round is 5 and pick is 158, so we need to include those columns too.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row 5, 'round' column\n- row 5, 'pick' column\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Kellen Davis was picked in round 5, not round 4. The relevant table cells confirm this information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
