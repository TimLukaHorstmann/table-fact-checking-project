The claim says: \"In Colton 's cross the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim refers to. The main elements are \"Colton 's cross\" and \"bridge,\" and it mentions that it's a \"pratt through truss bridge.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for entries related to Colton 's crossing bridge. Scanning the first column for \"colton 's crossing bridge,\" I find it in row 3 (since rows are zero-indexed, but here the actual row might be at index 4, depending on how the list is structured). Wait, let me check the table again. The markdown table shows each row with a name, so \"colton 's crossing bridge\" should be one of them.\n\nOnce I locate that specific bridge, I need to look at its type column. From the table, it's listed as \"pratt through truss.\" So that matches the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the westgaard bridge being a pratt pony through truss bridge is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the westgaard bridge in the table. Looking at the \"name\" column, there's an entry for \"westgaard bridge.\" Now, I should check what other information is provided about this bridge. Specifically, the claim mentions its style as a pratt pony through truss bridge, so I'll focus on the \"type\" column for this row.\n\nFrom the table, each bridge has a specific type listed. For the westgaard bridge, under the \"type\" column, it says \"pratt pony through truss.\" This matches exactly with what the claim is stating. Therefore, based on the information in the table, the claim appears to be true.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that my reasoning is correct and that I haven't missed any details. The westgaard bridge's type is explicitly listed as \"pratt pony through truss,\" which directly supports the claim. There are no conflicting or additional information that would negate this, so I don't see any reason to doubt it.\n\nNext, I should map out which cells in the table are relevant to verifying this claim. The relevant cells are those in the same row as the westgaard bridge, specifically the \"type\" column because that's where the style is listed. So, for the westgaard bridge, row index 22 (since the first entry is at row 0) and the column name \"type\" would be the key cells to check.\n\nIn summary, since the type of the westgaard bridge matches the claim, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell being the type column for that specific bridge.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the westgaard bridge, we look at its type in the table. The \"type\" column specifies it as a pratt pony through truss bridge, matching the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"In Stanley, the bridge is of the concrete deck girder style.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see what information it has about bridges in Stanley. Scanning through the 'location' column, I spot a row where location is \"stanley\". Let me find that.\n\nLooking at the table, there's an entry for the Great Northern Railway Underpass. The relevant columns here are name, listed, location, county, and type. \n\nThe 'type' column says \"concrete deck girder bridge\" for this specific bridge in Stanley. So that matches exactly with the claim made about the bridge style.\n\nI need to check if there's any other bridge in Stanley mentioned. Skimming through the locations, I don't see another entry for Stanley. So the only bridge in Stanley is the Great Northern Railway Underpass which is a concrete deck girder type.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific bridge in Stanley with the \"concrete deck girder\" style.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"cooperstown have a pratt through truss type bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in Cooperstown, there's a bridge of the \"pratt through truss\" type. So I need to check if such a bridge exists in the table under Cooperstown's location.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: name, listed, location, county, and type. My task is to find any rows where the location is \"cooperstown\" and the type is \"pratt through truss\".\n\nI'll start by scanning the 'location' column for \"cooperstown\". Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first few entries are beaver creek bridge, caledonia bridge, cedar creek bridge, colton's crossing bridge \u2013 none of these locations are Cooperstown.\n2. Continuing down, I see crystal bridge, eastwood park bridge, elliott bridge, fairview lift bridge, grace city bridge, etc. Still no Cooperstown here.\n3. When I reach romness bridge (row 17), the location is \"cooperstown\". So this seems relevant. Now, what's the type? It says pratt through truss.\n\nSo that row has both location as Cooperstown and type as pratt through truss. Therefore, it fully supports the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other entries for Cooperstown in case I missed something. Scanning further, I don't see another entry with location \"cooperstown\". So romness bridge is the only one.\n\nAlso, looking at the 'removed' columns, some bridges have been removed, but that doesn't affect the current state of whether a pratt through truss bridge exists there now. The table seems to be historical, so even if it's been removed, as per the claim, we are just checking existence in the past.\n\nTherefore, since romness bridge is listed with Cooperstown and type pratt through truss, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"cooperstown have a pratt through truss type bridge,\" I checked the table for any bridges located in Cooperstown with the specified type. The romness bridge meets both criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by looking at the table structure and understanding what each column represents.\n\nThe table has several columns: name, listed, location, county, and type. Each row represents a different bridge with its details. The claim mentions \"nesheim bridge be in mcville.\" So I need to find if there's a bridge named nesheim located in McVille.\n\nFirst, I'll search for the row where the \"name\" column is \"nesheim bridge.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Beaver Creek Bridge\n2. Caledonia Bridge\n3. Cedar Creek Bridge\n4. Colton's Crossing Bridge\n5. Crystal Bridge\n6. Eastwood Park Bridge\n7. Elliott Bridge\n8. Fairview Lift Bridge\n9.

Rainbow Arch Bridge\n\nI found the 15th row where name is \"nesheim bridge.\" Now, let's check its location. The location column for this bridge says \"mcville.\" So that matches the claim.\n\nNext, I should verify if there are any removed or extra details about this bridge that might affect the claim. Looking at the 'listed' and 'location' columns, the nesheim bridge was listed on 1997-02-27 in McVille. There's no mention of it being removed or having additional notes except in some other bridges like Blanchard Bridge and Liberty Memorial Bridge, which are marked as removed.\n\nSince the claim is about whether \"nesheim bridge be in mcville,\" and according to the table, yes, it is located there. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The relevant cells would be the row where the name is nesheim bridge and the location column for that row. So row_index 15 and column \"location.\"\n\nI don't see any other columns that are directly related to the claim, like county or type. The claim specifically mentions the bridge's location in McVille, so only those two cells are needed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the nesheim bridge is indeed located in mcville as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The Blanchard Bridge was listed as built in 1997 but removed in 2009. Similarly, the Goose River Bridge was also built in 1997 but also removed in 2009.\n\nThe claim says that Mcville has a Goose River Bridge that's currently under construction due to structural issues. From the table, it seems both bridges were removed after their initial construction, which suggests they are no longer operational or in use.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Cooper town is famous for the Blanchard Bridge\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about Cooper Town being famous because of the Blanchard Bridge. So I need to find information in the table related to both \"Cooper town\" and \"Blanchard bridge\".\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has several columns: name, listed, location, county, type. The relevant columns for the claim are likely 'name' (to check if Blanchard Bridge is mentioned) and perhaps 'location' or 'county' (to confirm it's in Cooper town). However, the term \"Cooper town\" isn't directly mentioned in the table's column names. There is a column called 'location', which might indicate where each bridge is located.\n\nLet me scan through the table to see if any row has 'Blanchard Bridge'. I find that there's an entry for Blanchard Bridge, but it's under the name column with value \"blanchard bridge\". The location for this bridge is listed as \"blanchard\", and the county is \"traill\".\n\nNow, checking the claim: Cooper town. But in the table, the location of the Blanchard Bridge is Blanchard, not Cooper town. So that suggests that while there's a Blanchard Bridge, it's located in Blanchard, not Cooper town.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Cooper town\", which might be a different spelling or name. Let me check if any row mentions 'Cooper town' as location or county. Scanning again, I see rows like romness bridge has a location of cooperstown, which is in Griggs county. So that's Cooperstown, not Cooper town.\n\nIs there another entry with \"cooper\" in the location? Let me check: no, only the romness bridge mentions 'cooperstown'. So it seems there's no entry for \"Cooper town\" itself, but a bridge near Cooperstown is listed as romness bridge.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that Cooper town is famous for Blanchard Bridge isn't supported by the table. The table doesn't mention Cooper town; instead, it mentions Cooperstown in relation to another bridge.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the ones for Blanchard Bridge, which are name: blanchard bridge, location: blanchard, and county: traill. But since the claim refers to Cooper town (which isn't present), only the Blanchard Bridge's details are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not mention \"Cooper town,\" but it lists a bridge named Blanchard Bridge in Blanchard, Traill County.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim itself. The claim has two main parts: it mentions the \"grace city bridge\" and describes it as a \"concrete deck girder bridge\" located in \"stanley.\" So, to verify this, I need to find the corresponding row in the table for the grace city bridge and check the location and type.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several columns: name, listed, location, county, and type. The rows list various bridges with their details. Let me scan through each row until I find one named \"grace city bridge.\"\n\nGoing down the list:\n1. beaver creek bridge\n2. caledonia bridge\n3. cedar creek bridge\n4. colton's crossing bridge\n5. crystal bridge\n6. eastwood park bridge\n7. elliott bridge\n8. fairview lift bridge\n9. grace city bridge \u2013 here it is.\n\nSo, the row index for \"grace city bridge\" is 8 (since we start counting from 0). Now, let's check the location and type columns for this row.\n\nFrom the table:\n- location: grace city\n- county: foster\n- type: pratt through truss\n\nWait a minute. The claim says it's a \"concrete deck girder bridge\" in \"stanley.\" But according to the table, the grace city bridge is located in \"grace city,\" not \"stanley.\" Also, its type is listed as \"pratt through truss,\" which isn't the same as \"concrete deck girder.\"\n\nSo, comparing this, the claim seems incorrect. The grace city bridge is in a different location and has a different type than what's stated.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other bridges near the end of the table, I see that some have been removed, but that doesn't affect our current check since we're focusing on the specific details for \"grace city bridge.\"\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is false because the grace city bridge isn't a concrete deck girder bridge in stanley; it's actually located in grace city and is a pratt through truss type.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the Grace City Bridge, I examined the relevant table columns.

The claim in question is: \"colton 's crossing bridge be a pratt through truss in adam county.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the information presented in the table.\n\nStarting with the bridge name: \"Colton's Crossing Bridge.\" Looking at the table provided, I should search for this exact name. Scanning through each row under the 'name' column, I notice that one entry is \"colton 's crossing bridge.\" The apostrophe might be a typo or formatting issue, but it seems to match the claim.\n\nNext, let's verify the type of bridge. The claim states that it's a \"pratt through truss\" bridge. In the table, under each bridge name, there's a 'type' column. For \"colton 's crossing bridge,\" the type is listed as \"pratt through truss.\" This matches exactly with the claim.\n\nNow, checking the location of the bridge. The claim doesn't specify a particular location beyond mentioning that it's in Adam County. Looking at the table, under the 'location' column for this bridge, the entry is just \"lisbon.\" There's no mention of Adam County here. This could be an issue because the claim refers to Adam County, which isn't listed as a location in the table.\n\nWait, that might not necessarily disprove the claim because the claim doesn't require the bridge to be in both locations. It specifically states Adam County for the county part, but the table shows the location is Lisbon. However, the 'county' column does list \"ransom\" for this bridge. So, if the claim says it's in Adam County, that's incorrect because according to the table, it's actually in Ransom County.\n\nHold on, let me double-check that. The 'location' is Lisbon, and under 'county,' it's Ransom. Therefore, the claim mentions \"Adam County,\" which doesn't align with the table data. So, that part of the claim is false.\n\nPutting it all together: The bridge does exist in the table as \"colton 's crossing bridge,\" is a pratt through truss type, but it's located in Lisbon within Ransom County, not Adam County. Therefore, the claim about being in Adam County is incorrect.\n\nSo, even though two parts of the claim are true (the name and the type), the county part is false.

Scanning through the names, I find \"westgaard bridge\" near the bottom of the list. Let me check the exact row.\n\nYes, the westgaard bridge is in row 22 (assuming rows start at index 0).

However, I should make sure there isn't any other reference or maybe an error in my understanding.\n\nLooking again, the county column for westgaard bridge is mchenry, not traill. So that's a red flag. The claim is incorrect on this point. But let me check all aspects to be thorough.\n\nNext, checking the type: pratt pony through truss. The table confirms this as well.

Therefore, the claim has an error in the county specified.\n\nI should also ensure there are no additional details or other mentions of the westgaard bridge that might affect this. Scanning through the rest of the table, I don't see any other entries for the westgaard bridge. The rows with removed statuses don't seem to be relevant here since the claim is about whether it's a pratt pony through truss in Traill County.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is incorrect because the actual county is Mchenry, not Traill.
