    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific things: the opponent and the attendance number for week 14.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week, from week 1 to week 17. Each row has columns like date, opponent, result, and attendance. My task is to check if in week 14, the opponent was the Kansas City Chiefs, and the attendance was 74524.\n\nSo I should start by finding week 14 in the table. Scanning through the 'week' column: weeks go up to 17, so week 14 is one of them. Let me find the exact row for week 14.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Week 13: December 9, 2001 vs Seattle Seahawks\n- Week 14: December 16, 2001 vs Kansas City Chiefs\n\nWait, no. The opponent in week 14 is listed as Kansas City Chiefs? Let me check again. The table shows for week 14, the date is December 16, 2001, and the opponent is \"kansas city chiefs.\" So that matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to verify the attendance number for week 14. According to the table, the attendance for week 14 is 77,778. But the claim states the attendance was 74,524. That doesn't match. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nSo, since the opponent part of the claim matches but the attendance does not, the entire claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because while the Kansas City Chiefs were the opponent in week 14, their attendance was actually 77,778, not 74,524.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
