    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about Danny Cipriani is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"Danny Cipriani, born November 2, 1987, be a fly half.\" So, I'm looking for information in the table that confirms these two points: his name, birthdate, and position.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several players. The first thing is to find Danny Cipriani's row. Scanning through each row... There it is, row number 20: \"danny cipriani | fly - half | ...\". So that confirms his position is fly - half, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, the birthdate. According to the table, Danny was born on November 2, 1987. The claim also mentions this exact date. That matches too.\n\nI should check if there's any conflicting information or if he plays a different position elsewhere, but from the table, his position is fly - half and he is listed as such. There doesn't seem to be any other entries for him that contradict this.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table: correct name, correct birthdate, and correct position.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of birth (age)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "prop steve borthwick be leicester 's best know player in that position",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"prop steve borthwick be leicester's best know player in that position\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Steve Borthwick, a prop player, and says he should be Leicester's best-known player at his position. So, I need to check if Steve Borthwick is listed as a prop for Leicester and then see how many caps he has compared to other props in Leicester.\n\nLooking at the table, Steve Borthwick is indeed a prop playing for Leicester. His date of birth is October 12, 1979, and he has 32 caps. Now, I need to check all other props listed for Leicester and see if any have more than 32 caps or are better known.\n\nScrolling through the table, I see that Phil Vickery (c) is a prop with 60 caps also playing for Wasps but originally from Leicester. Then, Matt Stevens has 20 caps for Bath, Andrew Sheridan has 20 caps for Sale, Tom Rees has 8 caps for Wasps, and Joe Worsley has 65 caps for Wasps.\n\nWait, Steve Borthwick is with Leicester and has 32 caps. But Phil Vickery, even though he's listed under Wasps, was a Leicester native, so maybe he's considered Leicester's best-known prop because of his high cap count. Also, looking at other props in Leicester: Jason Hobson is new, Tim Payne has 5 caps, Mark Regan has 43 caps.\n\nSo Phil Vickery (c) has 60 caps as a prop for Wasps but originally from Leicester. Steve Borthwick is with Leicester and has 32 caps. Now, if the claim says he's Leicester's best-known player in that position, I need to see who else is a prop for Leicester and compare their caps.\n\nLooking at Leicester's props: George Chuter, Mark Regan (43), Matt Stevens (20). Steve Borthwick is also there with 32. So Phil Vickery isn't with Leicester anymore but was known. Maybe he's considered the best because of his higher cap count when he played for Leicester.\n\nI think the claim might be false because Phil Vickery, though now at Wasps, might still be Leicester's best-known prop due to his high caps and association with them.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to verify that Steve Borthwick is indeed Leicester's best-known prop. After checking the table, it appears that Phil Vickery (c), although now at Wasps, was associated with Leicester and has a higher number of caps (60) compared to Steve Borthwick's 32. This suggests that the claim might be false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"club / province\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the position of the player bear 2 november 1987 be fly - half , the only 1 for a sale player.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It seems to make two points:\n\n1. There's a player whose date of birth is 2 November 1987, and their position is fly - half.\n2. This player is the only one from Sale who has this position.\n\nSo I need to check both conditions against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by finding any players with a date of birth on 2 November 1987. Scanning each row:\n\n- George Chuter: 9 July 1976\n- Lee Mears: 5 March 1979\n- Mark Regan: 28 January 1972\n- Jason Hobson: 10 February 1983\n- Tim Payne: 29 April 1979\n- Andrew Sheridan: 1 November 1979\n- Matt Stevens: 1 October 1982\n- Phil Vickery (c): 14 March 1976\n- Steve Borthwick: 12 October 1979\n- Louis Deacon: 7 October 1980\n- Ben Kay: 14 December 1975\n- Simon Shaw: 1 September 1973\n- Tom Croft: 7 November 1985\n- James Haskell: 2 April 1985\n- Michael Lipman: 16 January 1980\n- Magnus Lund: 25 June 1983\n- Lewis Moody: 12 June 1978\n- Tom Rees: 11 September 1984\n- Joe Worsley: 14 June 1977\n- Nick Easter: 15 August 1978\n- Luke Narraway: 7 September 1983\n- Danny Care: 2 January 1987\n- Lee Dickson: 29 March 1985\n- Andy Gomarsall: 24 July 1974\n- Paul Hodgson: 25 April 1982\n- Peter Richards: 10 March 1978\n- Richard Wigglesworth: 9 June 1983\n- Danny Cipriani: 2 November 1987 \u2192 This is a match! His DoB is 2 November 1987, and his position is fly - half.\n- Shane Geraghty: 12 August 1986\n- Charlie Hodgson: 12 November 1980\n- Jonny Wilkinson: 25 May 1979\n- Toby Flood: 8 August 1985\n- Jamie Noon: 9 May 1979\n- Mathew Tait: 6 February 1986\n- Mike Tindall: 18 October 1978\n- Paul Sackey: 8 November 1979\n- James Simpson - Daniel: 30 May 1982\n- David Strettle: 23 July 1983\n- Lesley Vainikolo: 4 May 1979\n- Iain Balshaw: 14 April 1979\n- Mark Ceto: 26 December 1979\n\nSo Danny Cipriani is the player with a DoB of 2 November 1987, and his position is fly - half. That checks out for the first part.\n\nNow, the second part says he's the only Sale player in that position. Looking at the table, I need to check all players from Sale, which are:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Danny Cipriani:Sale\n- Paul Sackey:Sale\n- James Simpson - Daniel:Sale\n\nWait, no, let me see. Actually, in the table, it says \"mark cueto\" as fullback and his team is sale. Wait, looking again, the last entry is Mark Ceto: 26 December 1979, position fullback, team Sale.\n\nSo checking for fly - half players from Sale:\n\nDanny Cipriani is a fly - half from Sale. Are there any others?\n\nLooking through the list, Paul Sackey is a wing from Sale. James Simpson - Daniel is also a wing from Sale. Mark Ceto is a fullback from Sale. None of them are fly - half.\n\nTherefore, Danny Cipriani is the only Sale player with the position of fly - half. So both conditions are met.\n\nThus, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"fly - half\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"Team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
