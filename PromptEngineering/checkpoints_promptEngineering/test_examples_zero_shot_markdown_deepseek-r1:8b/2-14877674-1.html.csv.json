Let me break down each part of the claim and cross-check it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The player mentioned is \"ken snelling,\" and he should be a fullback who was picked in round 7 at position 58.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to identify the row where the player is \"ken snelling.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: dick wildung\n- Row 3: irv comp\n- Row 5: roy mckay\n- Row 6: nick susoeff\n- Row 7: ken snelling\n\nSo, Ken Snelling is in row 7. Now, checking his position and pick details for that row.\n\nIn row 7, the \"position\" is \"fullback,\" which matches the claim's description of him being a fullback. The \"pick\" number is 58. Since the claim states he was picked at 58 in round 7, I need to check if his position and pick number align with that.\n\nWait, looking at row 7: pick is indeed 58. So both conditions are met\u2014position as fullback and being picked 58 in round 7.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"pick\"}, {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"position\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about George Zellick is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"George Zellick has a position of end and a school/club of Oregon State.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table to find any entries for George Zellick. Let me go row by row.\n\nLooking at the first column, it's labeled \"round,\" which doesn't seem relevant. The second column is \"pick,\" which also isn't related to the player's details. So I'll skip those and focus on the third column, which lists the player names.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Player is Dick Wildung\n- Row 3: Irvin Comp\n- Row 5: Roy McKay\n- Row 6: Nick Susoeff\n- Row 7: Ken Snelling\n- Row 8: Lester Gatewood\n- Row 9: Norm Verry\n- Row10: Solon Barnett\n- Row11: Bob Forte\n- Row12: Van Davis\n- Row13: Tom Brock\n- Row14: Ralph Tate\n- Row15: Don Carlson\n- Row16: Mike Welch\n- Row17: Ron Thomas\n- Row18: Jim Powers\n- Row19: Hal Prescott\n- Row20: Eddie Forrest\n- Row21: Lloyd Wasserbach\n- Row22: Mark Hoskins\n- Row23: Earl Bennett\n- Row24: George Zellick\n- Row25: Gene Bierhaus\n- Row26: George Makris\n- Row27: Pete Susick\n- Row28: Bud Hasse\n- Row29: Dick Thornally\n- Row30: Bob Ray\n- Row31: Brunel Christensen\n- Row32: Ken Rostkie\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me check again.\n\nRow 24 is where George Zellick appears. His position is listed as \"end\" and his school/club team is \"oregon state.\" That matches exactly what the claim says. So there's no need to look further because this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI should also ensure that there are no other entries for George Zellick in the table, but from scanning each row, it seems he only appears once in row 24. Therefore, his position and school are correctly stated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about George Zellick is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"George Zellick has a position of center and a school/club of Oregon State.\" So I need to check two things: his position and his school/club.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row for the name \"George Zellick.\" Since the table is in markdown format, the headers are \"round,\" \"pick,\" \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"school / club team.\" \n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n- Round 1: Players include dick wildung. No match.\n- Round 3: irv comp. Not George.\n- Round 5: roy mckay. Not him.\n- Round 6: nick susoeff. Nope.\n- Round 7: ken snelling.\n- Round 8: lester gatewood.\n- Round 9: norm verry.\n- Round 10: solon barnett.\n- Round 11: bob forte.\n- Round 12: van davis.\n- Round 13: tom brock. Not George.\n- Round 14: ralph tate.\n- Round 15: don carlson.\n- Round 16: mike welch.\n- Round 17: ron thomas.\n- Round 18: jim powers.\n- Round 19: hal prescott.\n- Round 20: eddie forrest.\n- Round 21: lloyd wasserbach.\n- Round 22: mark hoskins.\n- Round 23: earl bennett.\n- Round 24: george zellick. Oh, here we go! This is the one.\n\nNow, checking his position and school. The position column says \"end,\" not \"center.\" So that's a discrepancy. His school or club team is listed as \"oregon state,\" which matches the claim. But since the position doesn't match, the overall claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. In row 24, the player is George Zellick with pick number 228. Position is \"end\" and school is \"oregon state.\" So the claim says his position is center, which is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the position doesn't match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
