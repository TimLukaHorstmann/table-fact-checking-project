    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim states: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, the team lost 5 more times than they won.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. They are talking about the number of losses exceeding wins by 5 games in the 1982 season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The 'record' column seems to show the team's win-loss tally after each game. So, for each row, I can see their progress.\n\nNow, I need to identify all games played in 1982. Scanning through the table, the 'week' and 'date' columns are important here. Let me go row by row:\n\n- Week 1: September 12 vs Chargers. Result is a loss (L). So after week 1, record is 0-1.\n- Week 2: September 19 vs 49ers. They won (W), so 1-1.\n- Week 10: November 21 vs Seahawks. Loss, 1-2.\n- Week 11: November 28 vs Chargers. Loss again, 1-3.\n- Week 12: December 5 vs Falcons. Loss, 1-4.\n- Week 13: December 12 vs Rams. Win, so 2-4.\n- Week 14: December 19 vs Chiefs. Loss, 2-5.\n- Week 15: December 26 vs Raiders. Loss, 2-6.\n- Week 16: January 2 vs Seahawks. Loss, final record 2-7.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim is about the 1982 season. The last game is on January 2nd, which would be in early 1982 or perhaps late 1981? Depending on how they count it, maybe that's part of the 1982 season. Assuming all these games are part of 1982.\n\nNow, let's tally up their wins and losses from the 'result' column:\n\nWins: Weeks 2 and 13 \u2192 2 wins.\nLosses: All other weeks (1,10,11,12,14,15,16) \u2192 that's 7 losses.\n\nSo total record is 2-7.\n\nThe claim says they lost 5 more times than they won. Let's see: Wins=2, Losses=7. 7 - 2 = 5. So yes, the number of losses exceeds wins by exactly 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the given table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I analyzed each game in the provided table for the Denver Broncos during the 1982 season. They had 2 wins and 7 losses, which means they lost 5 more times than they won. This supports the claim.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, they play at the Mile High Stadium 4 more times than at the Kingdome.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the number of games played by the Broncos in 1982 at two different stadiums: Mile High Stadium and Kingdome. The claim states that they played 4 more games at Mile High Stadium compared to Kingdome.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists games from week 1 through week 16 of the 1982 season (since the last row is January 2, 1982). Each row has details like opponent, result, game site, and attendance. The relevant columns for the claim are \"game site,\" which indicates where each game was played.\n\nI need to count how many times they played at Mile High Stadium and at Kingdome in the 1982 season. Then compare those numbers to see if Mile High has 4 more games than Kingdome.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent - Chargers, result - loss, site - Mile High\nWeek 2: Opponent - 49ers, result - win, site - Mile High\nWeek 10: Opponent - Seahawks, result - loss, site - Mile High\nWeek 11: Opponent - Chargers, result - loss, site - Jack Murphy (not Mile High)\nWeek 12: Opponent - Falcons, result - loss, site - Mile High\nWeek 13: Opponent - Rams, result - win, site - Anaheim (not Mile High)\nWeek 14: Opponent - Chiefs, result - loss, site - Mile High\nWeek 15: Opponent - Raiders, result - loss, site - LA Memorial (not Mile High)\nWeek 16: Opponent - Seahawks, result - loss, site - Kingdome\n\nSo, games at Mile High Stadium are weeks 1,2,10,12,14. That's a total of 5 games.\n\nGames at Kingdome is only week 16: one game.\n\nThe claim says they played 4 more times at Mile High than at Kingdome. 5 (Mile High) - 1 (Kingdome) = 4. So the difference is indeed 4. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure there aren't any other games at Kingdome in 1982 that are not listed here. The table only goes up to week 16, and since it's the 1982 season, I think all games are accounted for. So yes, Mile High has 5, Kingdome has 1. Difference is 4, so claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to count the number of games at Mile High Stadium and Kingdome in the 1982 season.\n\n- **Mile High Stadium**: Weeks 1, 2, 10, 12, 14 \u2192 5 games\n- **Kingdome**: Week 16 \u2192 1 game\n\nThe difference is 5 - 1 = 4, which matches the claim. Thus, it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, week 12 and 14 were both played at Mile High Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find information about weeks 12 and 14 for the Denver Broncos in the 1982 season.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The rows go from week 1 to week 16.\n\nI'll start by finding week 12. Scanning through, I see that week 12 is December 5 against the Atlanta Falcons, with the game site as Mile High Stadium. So that's one location: Mile High Stadium.\n\nNext, I need to check week 14. Week 14 falls on December 19 against the Kansas City Chiefs. The game site for this week is also listed as Mile High Stadium.\n\nWait a second, but in the table, week 14 is labeled as \"l 16 - 37\" and the opponent is Kansas City Chiefs. The date is December 19, which makes it week 14 of the season. So both week 12 and week 14 have Mile High Stadium as their game site.\n\nBut I should double-check if these are indeed part of the 1982 season. The dates provided go up to January 2, 1983, which suggests that the 1982 season includes games into late December and early January.\n\nSo both weeks 12 and 14 have games at Mile High Stadium. Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both week 12 and week 14 of the 1982 Denver Broncos season were played at Mile High Stadium.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, week 1, 2, and 10 were played at the Mile High Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each week mentioned in the claim (weeks 1, 2, and 10) against the table provided to see if their games took place at the Mile High Stadium. The table lists the weeks from 1 to 16, with details including opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nLooking at week 1: According to the table, it's on September 12 against the San Diego Chargers, played at Mile High Stadium. So that's a match.\n\nWeek 2 is also in the table, on September 19 against the San Francisco 49ers, again at Mile High Stadium. That matches too.\n\nNow, week 10: The table shows November 21, 1982 against the Seattle Seahawks, and it's listed as being played at Mile High Stadium with a result of losing 10-17. So that checks out as well.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other games for these weeks in the table. For example, sometimes teams might have multiple home games or maybe some games are at different venues. Let me check each week mentioned:\n\nWeeks 1: Yes, Mile High Stadium.\nWeek 2: Yes, same venue.\nWeek 10: Also Mile High Stadium.\n\nSo all three weeks specified in the claim were played at Mile High Stadium according to the table. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any possibility that week 10 wasn't a home game or was played elsewhere. The table shows November 21 as the date for week 10, which is still within the Broncos' home schedule. They had games in weeks 1,2,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, but the last few weeks were against different opponents and possibly at different venues.\n\nWait, looking at the table again: Weeks 1-2 are at Mile High, week 10 is also there, then week 11 is at Jack Murphy Stadium. So yes, week 10 is a home game for the Broncos.\n\nTherefore, all three weeks mentioned in the claim were indeed played at Mile High Stadium.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all three specified weeks (1, 2, and 10) are listed as games played at Mile High Stadium according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, week 16 has the least amount in attendance of all 9 games.\" So, the key points here are:\n\n1. The season is 1982.\n2. Week 16 had the lowest attendance among all 9 games (I assume this means each of the 9 weeks, so week 1 to week 9 and maybe up to week 16? Wait, but the table only goes up to week 16.)\n3. Wait, actually, looking at the table, it starts from week 1 to week 16. So there are 16 weeks in total.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to \"all 9 game.\" Hmm, that might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to say \"all 9 games\" or perhaps \"all 16 games.\" But looking at the table, each week has an attendance number, and we need to check if week 16 has the least attendance among all weeks.\n\nWait, but the table provided starts from week 1 (September 12) up to week 16 (January 2). So there are 16 weeks in total. The claim says that during the 1982 season, week 16 had the least attendance of all 9 games. But there's a discrepancy here because the table has 16 weeks, not 9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me read it again: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season , week 16 have the least amount in attendance of all 9 game.\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's saying that among all 9 games played in week 16? But that doesn't make much sense because each week is a single game. So maybe the claim is stating that week 16 had the lowest attendance compared to all other weeks (i.e., weeks 1-15). Or perhaps the \"all 9 game\" part is incorrect, and it's supposed to be \"all 16 games.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that during the 1982 season, week 16 had the least attendance among all nine games played in the regular season or something else. But given the table has weeks from 1 to 16, I think the claim is comparing week 16's attendance with all other weeks (weeks 1-15) to see if it's the lowest.\n\nSo, my task is to check for each week (from week 1 to week 16) their attendance numbers and determine whether week 16 has the lowest among these. If yes, then the claim is true; otherwise, false.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nEach row represents a week with the following columns: week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance.\n\nThe 'attendance' column seems to have numbers like 73564, 73899, etc. So I need to extract these values and compare them across all weeks, specifically focusing on week 16's attendance.\n\nFirst, let me identify the attendance for week 16:\n\nLooking at the table, row with week 16 has an attendance of 43145.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is the lowest among all other weeks (weeks 1-15).\n\nTo do this, I'll list out all the attendances from week 1 to week 15 and see if week 16's attendance is indeed the smallest.\n\nWeek 1: 73564\n\nWeek 2: 73899\n\nWeek 10: 73996\n\nWeek 11: 47629\n\nWait, hold on. Week 11 has an attendance of 47,629 which is lower than week 16's 43,145? No, wait, 47k is higher than 43k.\n\nWait, let me list all the attendances:\n\nFrom the table:\n\nWeek 1: 73564\n\nWeek 2: 73899\n\nWeek 3: Not in table (since it starts from week 1 to week 16). Wait, no, the table has data for weeks 1,2,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. So some weeks are missing.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the table:\n\nThe 'week' column shows numbers: 1,2,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nSo there are only 9 data points in the table, corresponding to week 1,2,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. So the missing weeks are 3-9 and perhaps others? Wait, no, the table lists from week 1 to week 16, but some weeks are not filled in.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the markdown table:\n\n|   week | date         | opponent            | result    | game site                     | record   |   attendance |\n|-------:|:-------------|:--------------------|:----------|:------------------------------|:---------|-------------:|\n|      1 | september 12 | san diego chargers  | l 3 - 23  | mile high stadium             | 0 - 1    |        73564 |\n|      2 | september 19 | san francisco 49ers | w 24 - 21 | mile high stadium             | 1 - 1    |        73899 |\n|     10 | november 21  | seattle seahawks    | l 10 - 17 | mile high stadium             | 1 - 2    |        73996 |\n|     11 | november 28  | san diego chargers  | l 20 - 30 | jack murphy stadium           | 1 - 3    |        47629 |\n|     12 | december 5   | atlanta falcons     | l 27 - 34 | mile high stadium             | 1 - 4    |        73984 |\n|     13 | december 12  | los angeles rams    | w 27 - 24 | anaheim stadium               | 2 - 4    |        48112 |\n|     14 | december 19  | kansas city chiefs  | l 16 - 37 | mile high stadium             | 2 - 5    |        74192 |\n|     15 | december 26  | los angeles raiders | l 10 - 27 | los angeles memorial coliseum | 2 - 6    |        44160 |\n|     16 | january 2    | seattle seahawks    | l 11 - 13 | kingdome                      | 2 - 7    |        43145 |\n\nWait, that's 9 rows: weeks 1,2,10-16. So it's missing weeks 3-9 and perhaps some others? Wait, from week 1 to week 16, that's 16 weeks. The table has data for 9 of them.\n\nSo when the claim is made about \"all nine games,\" perhaps they mean the nine games listed in the table, but not all 16 weeks?\n\nBut the original problem statement says: \"You are tasked with determining whether the statement is true or false.\"\n\nThe user's task was to determine if the statement is true or false.\n\nAssuming that the data in the table is complete for all relevant weeks, and only these nine weeks have games, but that seems unlikely because in reality, a season has 16 weeks (games). So perhaps the claim refers to all the games listed in the table, not all 16 weeks.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that there are missing data, and we should treat week numbers as given. Wait, perhaps the task is just to compare based on the provided data.\n\nBut this complicates things because if some weeks (like 3-9) have lower attendances than week 16, but their attendance isn't listed, so how can we know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended that all games are accounted for in the table, which seems not to be the case. So perhaps I need to assume that the data given is complete.\n\nGiven that, let's extract all the attendances from weeks 1-16 based on the table:\n\nFrom week 1: 73,564\n\nWeek 2: 73,899\n\nWeek 10: 73,996\n\nWeek 11: 47,629\n\nWeek 12: 73,984\n\nWeek 13: 48,112\n\nWeek 14: 74,192\n\nWeek 15: 44,160\n\nWeek 16: 43,145\n\nSo the attendances are:\n\n- Week 1: 73564\n- Week 2: 73899\n- Week 10: 73996\n- Week 11: 47629\n- Week 12: 73984\n- Week 13: 48112\n- Week 14: 74192\n- Week 15: 44160\n- Week 16: 43145\n\nSo from these, the lowest attendance is week 11 with 47,629? Wait no:\n\nWait, let me list them numerically:\n\n43,145 (Week 16)\n\n44,160 (Week 15)\n\n47,629 (Week 11)\n\n48,112 (Week 13)\n\n73,564 (Week 1)\n\n73,899 (Week 2)\n\n73,984 (Week 12)\n\n74,192 (Week 14)\n\n73,996 (Week 10)\n\nWait, wait: Actually, no. Wait, I think I'm listing them incorrectly.\n\nNo, looking at the numbers:\n\n43,145 is the smallest.\n\nThen 44,160\n\nThen 47,629\n\nThen 48,112\n\nThen higher ones.\n\nSo week 16 has the lowest attendance among all these weeks.\n\nBut wait, hold on: if there are weeks with lower attendances than 43k but not listed in the table? No, because we only have data for these nine weeks. So within the available data, week 16 is the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the statement that \"the attendance at Week 16 was the lowest of all nine games\" would be true if all nine games are considered. But if \"all nine games\" refers to all nine listed in the table, which includes week 1-2 and 10-16, then yes.\n\nBut if the claim is about all weeks (weeks 1-16), but only some have data, it's not possible because we don't know attendances for missing weeks. But since the statement refers to \"all nine games,\" probably meaning the nine listed in the table, which includes week 16 as the lowest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant that Week 16 had the lowest attendance among all nine games (weeks 1-2 and 10-16), which is true because 43k is lower than all others provided.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true because the attendance at Week 16 was indeed the lowest among the listed nine games in the table. \n\n**Answer:** True",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, the team lost 5 more times than they won in December.\" Hmm, wait a minute. Looking at the table provided, I notice that all the dates are from September to January, but specifically, the games are labeled as weeks 1 through 16, with some taking place in November, December, and into January.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's any game in December where the Broncos played. The table has a few games in December: week 12 on December 5, week 13 on December 12, and week 14 on December 19. So yes, there are games in December that we need to consider.\n\nNext, I need to verify if in December, the team lost more times than they won. Looking at each December game:\n\n- Week 12 (December 5): Opponent is Atlanta Falcons, result is a loss (l 27 - 34). So that's one loss.\n- Week 13 (December 12): Opponent is Los Angeles Rams, result is a win (w 27 - 24). That's one win.\n- Week 14 (December 19): Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs, result is a loss (l 16 - 37). Another loss.\n\nSo in December, the Broncos played three games. They won once and lost twice. Therefore, they lost two times and won one time in December.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"lost 5 more times than they win.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense because in December, they only played three games. They can't lose five times if they only played three games total. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to the entire season and comparing losses to wins in December. Let me check the entire season's record.\n\nLooking at the table, the team starts with a 0-1 record after week 1, then goes to 1-1 after week 2, etc., ending up with a 2-7 record overall. So they won 2 games and lost 5 in the entire season? Wait no, let me count:\n\nLooking at each week's result:\n\nWeek 1: Loss (0-1)\nWeek 2: Win (1-1)\nWeeks 3-9: I don't see data for these weeks, but the table provided only shows specific weeks. So maybe they didn't play those games or lost them without being recorded here.\nWait, actually, the table only lists certain weeks with their results. The opponent and date are given for each listed week.\n\nSo perhaps the total number of wins and losses isn't all accounted for in the table, but we have to work with what's provided.\n\nWait, but the claim is about December games specifically, not the whole season. So let me focus on that.\n\nIn December (weeks 12, 13, 14), they lost two games and won one. So losses are twice, wins once. The claim says they lost five more times than they won in December, which would mean they lost six times if I'm interpreting \"5 more\" correctly. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count is based on the total season record. Wait, but the team ended with 2-7, meaning two wins and seven losses overall. The claim says during the 1982 season, they lost five more times than they won in December.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"lost 5 more times\" refers to losing five games, while winning zero. But that doesn't fit either because they did win one game in December.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a comparison between losses and wins in December: the number of losses is five more than the number of wins. So if they lost x times and won y times, then x = y + 5. In December, they lost two times (weeks 12,14) and won once (week13). So 2 \u2260 1+5=6. Therefore, that's not true either.\n\nWait, but the team only played three games in December: lost twice, won once. So losses are 2, wins are 1. The claim says they lost five more times than they won, which would mean 5 more losses than wins. So 2 is not equal to 1 +5=6.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false because they didn't lose five more times than they won in December; they only lost two times and won once.\n\nSo I need to identify the relevant cells that show this. The columns related are:\n\n- date: shows specific dates in December (rows for weeks 12,13,14)\n- opponent: not necessary unless we're checking the opponents, but the results matter more.\n- result: l or w indicating loss or win.\n- game site: perhaps not relevant here.\n- record: the overall team record is shown, but that's per week, so maybe not directly relevant to December games.\n- attendance: irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those where:\n\n- The date is in December (rows 12,13,14)\n- The result column shows l or w.\n\nSo for each of these rows (weeks 12,13,14), we need to check the result column. So row indices 12,13,14, looking at 'result'.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, the weeks are from 1 to 16, with some missing. So week 12 is December 5, 13 on Dec 12, and 14 on Dec 19.\n\nSo for each of these, we look at the result:\n\n- Week 12: l\n- Week 13: w\n- Week 14: l\n\nTherefore, in December (weeks 12,13,14), the team had two losses and one win. Thus, they didn't lose five more times than they won.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells, I need to list each row where date is in December and result is either l or w. So rows 12,13,14 (assuming rows are 0-indexed? Wait no, the table shows week 1 as row index 0, so week 12 would be row 11? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given table:\n\n|   week | date         | opponent            | result    | game site                     | record   |   attendance |\n|-------:|:-------------|:--------------------|:----------|:------------------------------|:---------|-------------:|\n|      1 | september 12 | san diego chargers  | l 3 - 23  | mile high stadium             | 0 - 1    |               |\n|      2 | ...          | ...                | ...       | ...                           | ...      | ...           |\n...\n|   12  | December 5   | ...                | l         | ...                           | ...      |               |\n|   13  | Dec 12       | ...                | w         | ...                           | ...      |               |\n|   14  | Dec 19       | ...                | l         | ...                           | ...      |               |\n\nSo in the table, week 12 is row index 11 (since weeks start at 1). Similarly, week 13 is row 12, week14 row13.\n\nBut wait, looking at the provided table structure:\n\nThe first row is header: \"week\" as column name. Then data rows are:\n\nRow 0: week 1\n\nRow 1: week 2\n\n...\n\nSo yes, for week N, it's row N-1.\n\nTherefore, weeks in December (12,13,14) correspond to rows 11,12,13.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor week 12 (row11):\n\n- date: Dec5, 1982\n- opponent: ?\n- result: l\n- game site: ?\n- record: ...\n- attendance: ...\n\nSimilarly for weeks 13 and14.\n\nSo each of these rows (11,12,13) in the table has a 'result' column that is either l or w. Therefore, to show that they lost two times and won once in December, we can include those cells.\n\nBut maybe more precisely, since the claim refers to losing five more than winning, it's better to focus on just showing that in December, they didn't have a ratio where losses exceed wins by five.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the 'result' column is needed for each relevant row.\n\nSo, I'll list all three rows (11,12,13) as their result columns show l, w, l respectively. That would allow someone to count that in December, they lost twice and won once.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the team lost five more times than it won in December 1982 is false. By examining the results of games played in December (weeks 12, 13, and 14), we see that the team actually lost two games and won one.\n\nRelevant data cells:\n- Week 12: Result is 'l'\n- Week 13: Result is 'w'\n- Week 14: Result is 'l'\n\nThese show two losses and one win in December, not five more losses than wins.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false. In December 1982, the team lost two games and won one, not losing five more times than winning. The relevant data cells are for weeks 12, 13, and 14, showing results 'l', 'w', and 'l' respectively.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

So that's another one.\n\nWait, the claim says weeks 12, 13, and 14 were all played at Mile High. But in reality, week 13 was at Anaheim Stadium. Therefore, not all three weeks were at Mile High.\n\nSo only weeks 12 and 14 were at Mile High.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, they play at the Mile High Stadium 4 more times than at the Kingdome and 2 more times than at Anaheim Stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I should check each part of this claim against the table. The table lists games from week 1 to week 16, with details like the opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nI need to find out how many times the Broncos played at Mile High Stadium, Kingdome, and Anaheim Stadium during that season. Let's go through each relevant column in the table.\n\nLooking at the \"game site\" column:\n\n- Mile High Stadium: This is mentioned for weeks 1, 2, 10, 12, 14, and 16.\n- Kingdome: Week 16.\n- Anaheim Stadium: Week 13.\n\nWait, let me count each venue:\n\nStarting with Mile High Stadium. From the table:\n- Week 1: Mile High\n- Week 2: Mile High\n- Week 10: Mile High\n- Week 12: Mile High\n- Week 14: Mile High\n- Week 16: Kingdome (so not Mile High)\nWait, no, week 16 is Kingdome, so that's separate.\n\nSo from weeks 1 to 16, the Broncos played at Mile High in weeks 1,2,10,12,14. That's a total of 5 games.\n\nNext, Kingdome: Looking through each row, only week 16 says \"kingdome\". So that's just 1 game at Kingdome.\n\nAnaheim Stadium: Only week 13 mentions \"anaheim stadium\", so that's 1 game.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the table to make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through each row:\n\nWeek 1: Mile High\nWeek 2: Mile High\nWeek 10: Mile High\nWeek 11: Jack Murphy (not relevant)\nWeek 12: Mile High\nWeek 13: Anaheim\nWeek 14: Mile High\nWeek 15: LA Memorial Coliseum (not relevant)\nWeek 16: Kingdome\n\nSo yes, that's 5 games at Mile High, 1 at Kingdome, and 1 at Anaheim.\n\nNow, the claim says they played at Mile High 4 more times than Kingdome. Let me see: If Kingdome had 1 game, then 4 more would be 5. So yes, that's correct because Mile High has 5 and Kingdome has 1.\n\nSimilarly, comparing to Anaheim: 5 vs. 1. The claim says 2 more times than Anaheim, which would mean 3 games at Mile High if the count were different. But since Mile High is 5 and Anaheim is 1, that's a difference of 4, not 2. So this part seems off.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check again:\n\nMile High: weeks 1,2,10,12,14 \u2192 that's 5 games.\nAnaheim: week13 \u2192 1 game.\n\nSo Mile High is 5, which is 4 more than Anaheim's 1 (5-1=4). So the claim says 2 more times than Anaheim, but it's actually 4 more. Therefore, the claim is incorrect for this part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check each week:\n\nWeek 1: Mile High\nWeek 2: Mile High\nWeek10: Mile High\nWeek12: Mile High\nWeek14: Mile High \u2192 that's 5.\nAnaheim only at week13 \u2192 1.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 4, not 2. So the claim is wrong in this part.\n\nBut wait, maybe the Kingdome part is correct. Mile High vs Kingdome: 5 vs 1. The claim says Mile High has 4 more than Kingdome, which would mean 5-1=4, so that's correct.\n\nSo for Mile High vs Kingdome: True (they played 4 more times at Mile High). But for Mile High vs Anaheim, it's not true because they played 4 more, not 2. So the overall claim is FALSE because one part is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me parse the claim again:\n\n\"during the 1982 denver bronco season , they play at the mile high stadium 4 more time than at the kingdome and 2 time more than at anaheim stadium\"\n\nSo Mile High has 4 more games than Kingdome: True (5-1=4).\nMile High has 2 more than Anaheim: False (5-1=4, not 2).\n\nSince one part is false, the entire claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells would be the ones with game site data for each venue.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because while the Broncos played four more games at Mile High Stadium than at Kingdome, they actually played four more games there than at Anaheim Stadium, not two. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says that during week 16 of the 1982 season, the attendance was the least with 74,192 attendees across all 9 games.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. It has columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different week, starting from week 1 to week 16.\n\nThe claim is specifically about week 16. So, I need to look at row for week 16 in the table. Let me check that row:\n\n- Week: 16\n- Date: January 2\n- Opponent: Seattle Seahawks\n- Result: l 11 - 13 (loss)\n- Game site: Kingdome\n- Record: 2 - 7\n- Attendance: 43,145\n\nWait a second. The claim says the least attendance was 74,192, but in week 16, the attendance is only 43,145. That's quite different. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLooking back at the table, perhaps I misread the data. Let me go through each row to see if any other weeks have attendance close to 74,192. Let's list out all the attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n- Week 11: 47,629\n- Week 12: 73,984\n- Week 13: 48,112\n- Week 14: 74,192\n- Week 15: 44,160\n- Week 16: 43,145\n\nHmm. So week 14 has the highest attendance at 74,192, not week 16. The claim says that week 16 had the least attendance of 74,192 across all 9 games. But according to the table, week 16's attendance is lower than some other weeks, but it's only 43,145, which is actually one of the lowest.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is confusing the date with the week number or something else. Alternatively, perhaps there was a misunderstanding in how the attendances are reported.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the claim is referring to all games in week 16 having that attendance. But looking at the table, each row represents a single game for that week, so in week 16, only one game is listed with an attendance of 43,145. The claim says \"least amount in attendance of 74192 in all 9 game,\" which suggests that across all 9 games (maybe all games from the season), week 16 had the lowest.\n\nBut let's check: what's the minimum attendance across all weeks? Let me list all attendances again:\n\nWeeks and their attendances:\n\n1:73,564\n\n2:73,899\n\n10:73,996\n\n11:47,629\n\n12:73,984\n\n13:48,112\n\n14:74,192\n\n15:44,160\n\n16:43,145\n\nSo the lowest attendance is 43,145 in week 16. The next lowest is week 11 at 47,629 and week 15 at 44,160.\n\nWait, but the claim says that week 16 had the least attendance of 74,192. But according to the table, that's not the case. In fact, 74,192 is the highest attendance in week 14.\n\nSo the claim seems incorrect because it's stating that week 16 had the lowest attendance at 74,192, which isn't true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during the 1982 season, week 16 had the least attendance of 74,192 across all 9 games. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- Week 16's attendance is 43,145, not 74,192.\n- The highest attendance in week 14 is 74,192.\n\nThus, the claim is false because week 16 does not have the least attendance as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It has columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific week of the season.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the 1982 season, so I need to focus on that year. However, looking at the table provided, the dates range from September 12 to January 2.

So I need to check the \"attendance\" column for these specific weeks and compare them with other weeks to see if they are indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance is 73,564\n- Week 2: Attendance is 73,899\n- Week 10: The table shows week 10 as November 21 against the Seattle Seahawks.

For example, week 11 is at Jack Murphy Stadium, and week 15 is at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\nSo, for Mile High Stadium attendance, let me list out all the weeks where the game was played there:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n- Week 12: 73,984\n- Week 13: 48,112 (but this week is at Anaheim Stadium)\n- Week 14: 74,192\n- Week 15: 44,160 (at LA Memorial Coliseum)\n- Week 16: 43,145 (Kingdome)\n\nWait, so weeks where the game was at Mile High Stadium are 1,2,10,12,14, and 16? Wait no, week 16 is in January but it's a different venue. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking back, the table shows that for week 13, the game site is Anaheim Stadium, so that week's attendance is not at Mile High.\n\nSimilarly, week 11 is Jack Murphy, week 15 is LA Memorial Coliseum, and week 16 is Kingdome.\n\nSo the Mile High Stadium attendances are in weeks: 1,2,10,12,14.\n\nNow, let me list their attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n- Week 12: 73,984\n- Week 14: 74,192\n\nWait, so week 1 is the lowest, followed by week 2, then week 12, then week 10, and finally week 14.\n\nSo among these weeks, the lowest attendance is week 1 at 73,564. The next lowest is week 2 at 73,899. Then week 12 at 73,984, week 10 at 73,996, and week 14 at 74,192.\n\nWait, so the claim says that weeks 1,2, and 10 had the lowest attendance. But according to this data, week 10 is actually higher than week 2, which itself is lower than week 12, etc.\n\nTherefore, among the Mile High Stadium games, the lowest attendances are week 1 (73,564) and week 2 (73,899). Week 10 has a higher attendance than both of these. So weeks 1 and 2 have the lowest attendances in Mile High Stadium, but week 10 is not among the lowest.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The claim says that weeks 1,2, and 10 had the lowest attendance. But according to the table, week 10 has higher attendance than both week 1 and week 2. So the claim is incorrect because week 10's attendance isn't the lowest; it's actually higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that weeks 1, 2, and 10 had the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium during the 1982 season.
