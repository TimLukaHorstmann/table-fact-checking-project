    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Kristofer Martin was nominated for a Best Actor award in 2012 and won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table for the year 2012 because that's when both events supposedly happened.\n\nLooking at 2012:\n\n1. **The Young Critics Circle Awards**: Nominated for \"Best Performance.\" But Kristofer Martin isn't listed here as nominated in this category.\n   \n2. **28th PMPA Star Awards for Movies**: Nominated for \"New Movie Actor of the Year\" but it's from the \"Tween Academy: Class of 2012,\" which is a different category. The claim doesn't mention this, so probably not relevant.\n\n3. **FAMAS Awards**: Won the \"German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\" That matches part of the claim, so this row is definitely relevant.\n\n4. **1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards**: Won for \"Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching.\" Again, unrelated to Kristofer's acting awards.\n\nSo from 2012, only the FAMAS entry is directly related because it mentions Kristofer Martin winning the German Moreno award. \n\nNow, checking if he was nominated for Best Actor in a supporting role in 2012. Looking through each year:\n\nIn 2013, there are three entries:\n- Nominated for \"Stand Out Season Performer.\"\n- Won \"Honorable Mention\" and \"Best Supporting Actor.\" Both these awards were won by Oros, not Kristofer.\n\nIn 2012, the only nomination related to Kristofer is the FAMAS award he won. There's no mention of a Best Actor in a supporting role nomination in 2012 for him. \n\nWait, the claim says he was \" nominated for 3 act award in 2012.\" The table shows that in 2012, the only award he got was the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, and there's no mention of a Best Actor nomination for him in 2012. So the first part of the claim might be incorrect because he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in 2012.\n\nHowever, he did win the German Moreno award in 2012, so that part is correct. But since the claim includes both events happening in 2012, and only the second part checks out while the first doesn't, does that make the entire claim false?\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"was nominated for a Best Actor award in 2012 and won the German Moreno.\" If he was indeed nominated for Best Actor in 2012 but didn't win it, the claim would be about being nominated and winning something else. But according to the table, in 2013, he was won Best Supporting Actor, not in 2012.\n\nSo in 2012, the table shows only one award: German Moreno which he won. There's no mention of a nomination for Best Actor in 2012. Therefore, the claim is partially incorrect because the first part (nomination) doesn't align with the table data provided.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE because Kristofer wasn't nominated for a Best Actor award in 2012, despite winning another award that year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kristofer Martin was both nominated for a Best Actor award and won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012. \n\nFrom the table:\n- In 2012, he only won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at FAMAS Awards.\n- There is no mention of him being nominated for Best Actor in 2012.\n\nTherefore, since the claim includes a nomination that didn't occur, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

In the table, there are three entries for 2013:\n\n1. 1st Sunday All Stars Awards: Stand Out Season Performer, Nominated.\n2. 16th Long Island International Film Expo: Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Won.\n3. 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Won.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific awards in 2013:\n\n- 16th Long Island International Film Expo: Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor\n- 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nAccording to the table, both of these results are \"won.\" The claim says Kristofer Martin received an honorable mention (which he did) and won the best actor category (also as per the table).\n\nSo the claim seems accurate based on the table.\n\nI should check if all parts are covered. The claim specifies that in Oros, he got the two results.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about Kristofer Martin is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Kristofer Martin have been nominate for 7 act award between 2012 and 2013 , win 4 of those award.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and then cross-reference that with the information in the table.\n\nStarting with the name \"Kristofer Martin,\" the table entries might be under different spellings or variations. In the table, the names mentioned are \"Oros\" appearing multiple times as the nominated for or won by person. I need to check if \"Kristofer Martin\" corresponds to \"Oros.\" Since the claim uses \"Kristofer Martin,\" it's possible that this is a pseudonym or alternative name.\n\nNext, looking at the years 2012 and 2013 in the table, there are several award entries. Each row has the year, award body, category, nominated for, and result. I need to look specifically between 2012 and 2013, so that's rows with year 2012 and 2013.\n\nFor each of those years, let's list the relevant information:\n\nIn 2013:\n- Award: 1st sunday all stars awards\n  - Category: stand out season performer\n  - Nominated for: none\n  - Result: nominated\n\n- Award: 16th long island international film expo\n  - Category: honorable mention for best supporting actor\n  - Nominated for: Oros\n  - Result: won\n\n- Award: 10th golden screen awards\n  - Category: best actor in a supporting role\n  - Nominated for: Oros\n  - Result: won\n\nIn 2012:\n- Award: the young critics circle awards\n  - Category: best performance\n  - Nominated for: Oros\n  - Result: nominated\n\n- Award: 28th pmpc star awards for movies\n  - Category: new movie actor of the year\n  - Nominated for: tween academy : class of 2012\n  - Result: nominated\n\n- Award: famas awards\n  - Category: german moreno youth achievement award\n  - Nominated for: n / a\n  - Result: won\n\n- Award: 1st party pilipinas most liked awards\n  - Category: most liked loveteam with joyce ching\n  - Nominated for: n / a\n  - Result: won\n\nNow, the claim states that Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 acting awards between 2012 and 2013. From the table, let's count how many times Oros (assumed to be Kristofer Martin) was nominated in these years.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- 2013: stand out season performer - nominated for none (row index 0)\n- 2013: honorable mention for best supporting actor - won\n- 2013: best actor in a supporting role - won\n- 2012: best performance - nominated\n- 2012: new movie actor of the year - nominated\n- 2012: german moreno youth achievement award - won (but this category might not be acting)\n- 2012: most liked loveteam with joyce ching - won (this is likely not an acting award)\n\nWait, some categories might not fall under acting awards. For example, \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" and \"german moreno youth achievement award\" are likely not acting categories, so the results for those may not count towards acting nominations or wins.\n\nSo, focusing only on acting-related categories:\n\nIn 2013:\n- honorable mention for best supporting actor: won\n- best actor in a supporting role: won\n\nIn 2012:\n- best performance: nominated\n- new movie actor of the year: nominated\n\nThat's four acting awards where Oros (Kristofer Martin) was either nominated or won. But the claim says he was nominated for 7 awards, which seems too high. However, I'm noticing that in each year (2012 and 2013), there are three award entries each, but not all of them are acting categories.\n\nWait, actually, looking back:\n\nIn 2012:\n- best performance: acting category\n- new movie actor of the year: acting\n- german moreno: non-acting\n- most liked loveteam: non-acting\n\nSo, in 2012, two acting-related awards (best performance and new movie actor), both nominated.\n\nIn 2013:\n- stand out season performer: possibly acting\n- best supporting actor: acting, won\n- best actor in a supporting role: acting, won\n\nBut the first row for 2013 says \"none\" as the nominated for. So that's one acting award (best supporting) and another (best actor), both won.\n\nSo total acting awards:\n\n2012:\n- best performance: nominated\n- new movie actor: nominated\n\nTotal: 2 nominations\n\n2013:\n- best supporting: won\n- best actor: won\n\nTotal: 2 wins\n\nWait, that's four awards where Oros either was nominated or won. But the claim says he was \"nominate for 7 act award,\" which I think refers to being nominated for seven acting awards. The table shows only four such instances.\n\nAdditionally, in 2013, the first row (stand out season performer) was not nominated for anyone, so Oros didn't get a nomination there.\n\nIn 2012, he had two acting nominations, and in 2013, he won two acting awards but wasn't nominated for stand out season.\n\nSo total acting-related nominations: 2 in 2012, plus none in 2013 except the two wins which don't count as nominations. Therefore, total acting nominations are 2 (from 2012) and possibly one more if \"stand out season performer\" is considered an acting category where he was not nominated.\n\nWait, but if we consider only the acting categories where he was either nominated or won:\n\nIn 2013:\n- best supporting: won\n- best actor: won\n\nIn 2012:\n- best performance: nominated\n- new movie actor: nominated\n\nSo that's four awards. But the claim says he was \"nominate for 7 act award,\" which suggests seven acting nominations, but according to the table, it's only two.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all possible awards between 2012 and 2013:\n\nLooking at each row where year is 2012 or 2013, let's check if the category is acting:\n\n- 2013:\n  - stand out season performer: acting? Possibly.\n  - best supporting actor: acting\n  - best actor in a supporting role: acting\n\n- 2012:\n  - best performance: acting\n  - new movie actor of the year: acting\n  - german moreno: not acting\n  - most liked loveteam: not acting\n\nSo, considering all these:\n\nIn 2013:\n- stand out season performer: nominated for none (maybe acting)\n- best supporting: won\n- best actor: won\n\nIn 2012:\n- best performance: nominated\n- new movie actor: nominated\n\nSo, total acting nominations across both years are four. But the claim says he was \"nominate[d] for 7 act award.\" That doesn't align.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row is a separate award. So:\n\n2013:\n1. stand out season performer: not nominated (so no)\n2. best supporting actor: won\n3. best actor: won\n\nSo two acting awards, both wins.\n\n2012:\n1. best performance: nominated\n2. new movie actor: nominated\n3. german moreno: not acting\n4. most liked loveteam: not acting\n\nSo, two acting nominations.\n\nTotal of four acting-related instances (two nominations and two wins), but the claim says \"nominate for 7 act award,\" which is about seven acting awards where he was only in two categories, both years.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the count is different. Maybe I'm missing some categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Oros was part of multiple awards, but they are all in acting categories, so let's recount:\n\n2013:\n- best supporting: won\n- best actor: won\n\nThat's two.\n\n2012:\n- best performance: nominated\n- new movie actor: nominated\n\nThat's two more.\n\nBut the claim says he was \"nominate for 7 act award,\" which seems to suggest seven different acting awards where he was nominated, but in reality, it's only four (two wins and two nominations). Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the table.\n\nAlternatively, if each performance is considered a separate award, perhaps Oros was part of multiple performances leading to more awards. But looking at the table, each row seems to be an individual award, not grouped.\n\nSo, given that, I think the initial analysis stands: only four acting-related awards where he either won or was nominated, but none of them are seven.\n\nBut wait, perhaps each win counts as a separate act award? No, because the term \"nominate for 7 act award\" likely refers to being considered for seven different awards, not just winning them.\n\nTherefore, if Oros was only in four acting-related awards (two wins and two nominations), then he wasn't nominated for seven. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting which categories are acting ones.\n\nWait, \"best performance\" could be a single award, but maybe \"new movie actor of the year\" is another, and in 2013, best supporting and best actor are two more. That's four.\n\nTherefore, he was involved in four acting awards, but not seven. So the claim that he was \"nominate[d] for 7 act award\" seems incorrect.\n\nBut then again, the table shows only four, so unless there's more context or additional awards not listed here, perhaps the initial task is to accept the given data and analyze accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just list all acting-related awards in both years:\n\n2012:\n- best performance: nominated\n- new movie actor of the year: nominated\n\nTotal: 2 nominations\n\n2013:\n- best supporting actor: won\n- best actor in a supporting role: won\n\nTotal: 2 wins\n\nSo, total acting involvement is four (two wins and two nominations). Therefore, he was not \"nominate[d] for 7 act award,\" but rather four.\n\nBut the claim says seven, so according to the table, it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some awards. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n2013:\n1. stand out season performer: not acting? Or is it acting? If \"stand out season performer\" is an acting category, then he was not nominated, but in that case, it would be a fifth acting award where he didn't get a nomination. But if it's non-acting, then only four.\n\n2012:\n1. best performance: acting\n2. new movie actor: acting\n3. german moreno: non-acting\n4. most liked loveteam: non-acting\n\nSo in 2012, two acting awards (nominated)\nIn 2013, two acting awards (won)\n\nTotal of four.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he was \"nominate[d] for 7 act award\" is false based on the table provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each category counts as multiple awards. For example, being in a film might count as multiple awards. But I don't think so; each row seems to be a separate award.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: The claim that he was \"nominate[d] for 7 act award\" is incorrect based on the given table.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim that Oros (assumed to be Kristofer Martin) was \"nominate[d] for 7 act award\" between 2012 and 2013 is incorrect. According to the table, he was involved in four acting-related awards: two nominations in 2012 and two wins in 2013. Therefore, there were only four acting awards where he participated, not seven.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe claim is incorrect. Oros was not nominated for 7 act awards but rather participated in four acting-related awards (two nominations and two wins).",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in Oros.\" So, first, I should look through the table and find all instances where Kristofer Martin was nominated for awards.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a year, the award body, category, nominated for, and result. Let me scan each row:\n\n- 2013: First Sunday All Stars Awards - Stand Out Season Performer, Nominated For: None, Result: Nominated.\n- 2013: 16th Long Island International Film Expo - Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won.\n- 2013: 10th Golden Screen Awards - Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won.\n- 2012: The Young Critics Circle Awards - Best Performance, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Nominated.\n- 2012: 28th PMPC Star Awards for Movies - New Movie Actor of the Year, Nominated For: Tween Academy: Class of 2012, Result: Nominated.\n- 2012: FAMAS Awards - German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, Nominated For: N/A, Result: Won.\n- 2012: 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards - Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching, Nominated For: N/A, Result: Won.\n\nSo Kristofer Martin is mentioned in the table. Let's see which rows apply to him.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0 (2013): The award is for Stand Out Season Performer, but the nominated for field says 'none', so that's not Oros. So this doesn't count towards the claim.\n\nRow 1 (2013): He was given an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor, and the Nominated For is Oros. Since he won this award, does that count as a nomination? Wait, in the table, 'result' is either 'won' or 'nominated'. So if it's 'won', that means he actually received the award, not just a nomination. But the claim talks about nominations, so maybe only 'nominated' results count towards his award nominations.\n\nRow 2 (2013): Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won. Same as above, this is a win, not a nomination.\n\nRows 3 and 4 (2012): Row 3: Best Performance, Nominated For: Oros, so that's a nomination. Row 4: New Movie Actor of the Year, but the Nominated For is Tween Academy, so that doesn't apply to Oros.\n\nSo how many times was he nominated for Oros? In 2013, in rows 1 and 2, he won both categories, which are under Oros. But since they resulted in 'won', not 'nominated', do those count towards his nominations?\n\nWait, the claim is about award nominations, not wins. So we only count entries where the result is 'nominated'. \n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 1 (2013): Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won. So even though he was nominated, he won it, so does that still count as a nomination? The claim is about his award nominations, regardless of the outcome.\n\nSimilarly, in Row 2 (2013), same situation: Nominated For: Oros, but Result: Won.\n\nIn Row 3 (2012): Nominated For: Oros, Result: Nominated. So that's one.\n\nSo total:\n\nRow 1: 1 nomination for Oros (even though he won)\nRow 2: 1 nomination for Oros (even though he won)\nRow 3: 1 nomination for Oros\nSo that's three nominations for Oros.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are indeed three award nominations where Kristofer Martin was nominated for his performance in Oros.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kristofer Martin has three award nominations for his performance in \"Oros.\" By examining each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (2013)**: Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won \u2192 Counts as a nomination.\n- **Row 2 (2013)**: Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won \u2192 Counts as a nomination.\n- **Row 3 (2012)**: Nominated For: Oros, Result: Nominated \u2192 Clearly a nomination.\n\nThus, there are three instances where Kristofer Martin was nominated for \"Oros,\" making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. \n\nI'll start by focusing on 2013 because that's the year mentioned in the claim. Scanning through the 2013 rows:\n\n1. First Sunday All Stars Awards: Stand Out Season Performer, Nominated for: None, Result: Nominated.\n2. 16th Long Island International Film Expo: Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Nominated for: Oros, Result: Won.\n3. 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Nominated for: Oros, Result: Won.\n\nWait, the third row says \"Oros\" was won in the best actor category. So Kristofer Martin (assuming that's who 'Oros' refers to) did win an award in 2013. But the claim states he only nominated once and didn't win any. That seems contradictory because here he actually won two awards: one for honorable mention and another as best supporting actor.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if \"kristofer martin\" is the same as \"oros.\" Maybe Oros is another name or a stage name. If they're the same person, then Kristofer did win in 2013, which contradicts the claim that he didn't win any. \n\nLooking at the other years: 2012 has some nominations but no wins. But the claim is specifically about 2013.\n\nSo based on this, the claim seems to be false because Kristofer Martin (as Oros) won in 2013.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Kristofer Martin, known as Oros, actually won two awards in 2013, contradicting the assertion that he didn't win any. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

The relevant columns here are 'year', 'award giving body', 'category', 'nominated for', and 'result'.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **2013**:\n   - He was nominated for 'stand out season performer' but didn't win.\n   - He won in 'best actor in a supporting role' category, which was awarded by the 10th Golden Screen Awards.\n   - Another award he won in 2013 is 'honorable mention for best supporting actor' from the 16th Long Island International Film Expo.\n\n2. **2012**:\n   - He was nominated for 'best performance'.\n   - He won the 'new movie actor of the year' award at the 28th PMPA Star Awards.\n   - He also won the 'german moreno youth achievement award' and another award for being part of a most liked loveteam.\n\nSo, in total, Kristofer Martin (oros) has three wins between 2012 and 2013. The claim mentions two awards not based on nominations for specific shows.\n\nLooking at each win:\n- **2013 Golden Screen Best Actor**: He was nominated by the 'tween academy : class of 2012' and won.\n- **2013 Long Island Film Expo Honorable Mention**: This is an award, so it's a win. The table doesn't specify whether this was based on nomination or not. However, since he won, perhaps it's based on his performance rather than a specific show's nomination.\n\nWait, the claim says \"not base on nomination for a specific show.\" So if the award was given because of a specific show's nomination, then the claim would be incorrect.\n\nLooking at each win:\n- **2013 Golden Screen Best Actor**: He was nominated by 'tween academy : class of 2012'\u2014so this is based on a nomination from that group. Therefore, this would be one award based on a specific show's nomination.\n- **2013 Long Island Film Expo Honorable Mention**: This category doesn't mention a specific show in the 'nominated for' column. So perhaps this wasn't based on a specific show's nomination.\n- **2012 PMPA Star Awards New Movie Actor**: He was nominated by 'oros' and won, so it's unclear which specific show this is based on. Maybe it's based on his role in a specific movie, not necessarily a show's nomination.\n\nWait, the claim says \"between 2012 and 2013,\" so including both years. In 2012, he had two wins: one for 'new movie actor' and another for 'german moreno youth achievement award.' The latter is likely based on his role in a specific film or show, but the table doesn't specify.\n\nSo, considering all this:\n- He won three awards between these years.\n- Two of them (2013 Golden Screen and 2012 PMPA) were based on nominations for specific groups, possibly tied to shows/movies. The third win (Long Island Film Expo) might not be based on a specific show's nomination.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"two of the award wins... not base on nomination.\" So if two wins are not based on specific show nominations, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the three wins:\n- **2013 Golden Screen**: Based on nomination for 'tween academy : class of 2012' (a specific group), so tied to a show.\n- **2013 Long Island Film Expo**: No specific show mentioned in the 'nominated for' column, so perhaps not based on a specific show's nomination.\n- **2012 PMPA Star Awards**: The 'nominated for' is listed as 'oros', which might be his name or a placeholder. It doesn't specify a specific show, so maybe this win isn't based on a show's nomination.\n\nWait, but the claim is about two of them not being based on nominations for specific shows. If only one (Long Island) isn't based on a specific show, then perhaps it's only one, which would make the claim FALSE because it says two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the PMPA Star Awards are based on his role in a movie, not a specific TV show. So if that's the case, both 2013 Long Island and 2012 PMPA might not be based on specific shows' nominations, making it two awards not based on such nominations, thus supporting the claim as TRUE.\n\nI think I need to clarify this from the table. The 'nominated for' column says:\n\n- **2013 Golden Screen**: oros\n- **2013 Long Island Film Expo**: honorable mention for best supporting actor (no specific show mentioned)\n- **2012 PMPA Star Awards**: new movie actor of the year (oros)\n- **2012 Famas Awards**: n/a\n\nSo, perhaps in 2012, he was nominated by 'oros' for PMPA, which is his name or a group. It's unclear if it's tied to a specific show.\n\nIf we assume that two awards (Long Island and PMPA) are not based on nominations for specific shows because the 'nominated for' column doesn't specify a particular show, then the claim would be TRUE because two of his wins aren't based on such nominations. The Golden Screen was based on a specific group nomination, which might count as a show's nomination.\n\nAlternatively, if PMPA is tied to a specific movie or show, but since it's not specified in the table, perhaps it's considered not based on a specific show's nomination.\n\nTherefore, considering that two of his wins are not based on specific shows' nominations (Long Island and PMPA), the claim would be TRUE. But wait, I'm only seeing three wins: Golden Screen, Long Island, and PMPA. If the claim says \"two,\" then it's referring to two awards not based on specific show nominations.\n\nWait, but in 2012, he had two wins: PMPA and Famas. The Famas was 'german moreno youth achievement award,' which is likely based on his role in a specific film or TV show, so that's one based on a specific show's nomination. Then the other 2012 win (PMPA) might not be.\n\nIn 2013, he had two wins: Golden Screen and Long Island. The Golden Screen was based on a specific group, possibly tied to a show, while Long Island wasn't.\n\nSo in total:\n- **Golden Screen**: Based on a specific group's nomination, possibly tied to a show.\n- **Long Island Film Expo**: Not specified, likely not based on a show's nomination.\n- **PMPA Star Awards**: Unclear but might be based on his role in a movie, not a show.\n- **Famas Awards**: Likely based on his role in a specific film or TV show.\n\nThus, two of his wins (Long Island and PMPA) are not based on specific shows' nominations, supporting the claim as TRUE. But I'm uncertain about PMPA because if it's for a movie, then maybe it's not considered a 'show.' The original task is about shows, so perhaps only Long Island isn't based on a show's nomination.\n\nThis confusion makes me think I need to count only wins not tied to specific shows, which would be Long Island and Famas. But Famas was likely for his performance in a show or movie. If the claim specifies that the two are not based on show nominations, then if only Long Island isn't, it's incorrect.\n\nI'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should consider that the claim is stating that two of his wins aren't based on specific shows' nominations. Based on the table, only the Long Island Film Expo and possibly PMPA are not tied to a specific show, making it two awards. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, in 2012, he had three wins: PMPA (based on oros), Famas, and maybe another. Wait no, the table shows only two wins in 2012: PMPA and Famas. His 2013 wins are Golden Screen and Long Island. So total of four wins.\n\nThe claim says \"two of the award wins,\" so considering that two of them aren't based on specific show nominations (Long Island and PMPA), then it's TRUE.\n\nSo, after this lengthy consideration, I think the answer is that the statement is TRUE because at least two of his awards are not based on specific show nominations.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is **TRUE**. Based on the analysis:\n\n- **2013 Golden Screen Award**: Likely tied to a specific group's nomination, possibly related to a show.\n- **2013 Long Island Film Expo Honorable Mention**: Not specified as tied to a particular show.\n- **2012 PMPA Star Awards New Movie Actor**: Unclear, but not specifically linked to a show in the provided information.\n- **2012 Famas Awards German Moreno Youth Achievement Award**: Likely based on his role in a specific film or TV show.\n\nAmong his four wins, two (Long Island Film Expo and PMPA) are not explicitly tied to a specific show's nomination. Therefore, the statement that two of his award wins are not based on such nominations holds true.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about Kristofer Martin is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in 2013 , kristofer martin receive 2 honorable mention for best support actor in oros , at the 16th long island international film expo , but win best actor in a supporting role for oros at the famas award.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if all parts of this claim are accurate according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various awards, categories, nominated for, and results. The rows are for different years, 2012 and 2013, with several award-giving bodies, categories, nominees, and outcomes.\n\nLet's parse the claim:\n\n1. In 2013, Kristofer Martin received two honorable mentions for best supporting actor in \"Oros\" at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo.\n2. He won the best actor in a supporting role for \"Oros\" at the FAMAS award.\n\nNow, I need to check if these are supported by the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: In 2013, did Kristofer Martin receive two honorable mentions? Looking at the table, in 2013, there's an entry for the 16th Long Island International Film Expo that awarded \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" to \"oros\". So that's one. But the claim says he received two. However, looking through the table, I only see one such entry in 2013. There's another award in 2012 where he was nominated for something else, but that's a different year.\n\nSo, does Kristofer Martin receive two honorable mentions in 2013? From the table, it seems like just one. Therefore, the claim about two may be incorrect.\n\nMoving on to the second part: He won best actor in a supporting role at the FAMAS award for \"Oros\". Looking through the table, there's an entry for 2012 with FAMAS awards where he won something else (german moreno youth achievement award), and another entry for 2013 with FAMAS, but it's about best actor in a supporting role. Wait, actually, looking closely:\n\nWait, no. The table has:\n\nIn 2013:\n- 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best actor in a supporting role, oros, won.\n\nSo that would be the FAMAS award? I think FAMAS is the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences, also known as the \"FAMAS Award\". So if he won best actor in a supporting role for \"oros\" at the FAMAS in 2013, that's correct based on the table.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"at the famas award\", but according to the table, it's the 10th Golden Screen Awards. Wait, is that the same as FAMAS? I'm not entirely sure because sometimes award bodies have different names. Maybe Golden Screen is another name for FAMAS or a related award.\n\nWait, looking up (but since I can't access external info), I recall that the FAMAS Award is given by the Filipino group, so perhaps the \"10th golden screen awards\" refers to FAMAS. Alternatively, maybe it's a different award. Hmm, this could be confusing.\n\nBut according to the table:\n\nIn 2013:\n- At 16th Long Island Film Expo: Honorable mention for best supporting actor (oros), won.\n- At 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best actor in a supporting role (oros), won.\n\nSo, he has two wins in 2013. But the claim says he received two honorable mentions and one win. The table shows that he got an honorable mention at Long Island Expo and won best actor at Golden Screen.\n\nBut the claim says he received two honorable mentions for best support actor. Wait, the table only shows one honorable mention in 2013. So perhaps the claim is incorrect there because it's only one, not two.\n\nSo, the claim has two parts:\n\n- He received two honorable mentions for best supporting actor.\n- He won the FAMAS award for best supporting role.\n\nFrom the table, he got one honorable mention and a win at Golden Screen (which might be FAMAS). So the second part is correct, but the first part says two, which isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the claim is partially incorrect because of the number of honorable mentions.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the table again. In 2013:\n\n- Row 1: 16th Long Island Intl Film Expo: Honorable mention for best supporting actor (oros), result won.\n- Row 2: 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best actor in a supporting role (oros), result won.\n\nSo, he has one honorable mention and one win. The claim says two honorable mentions, which isn't accurate. Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly states that he received two honorable mentions instead of one.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"Kristofer Martin has been nominated for 7 best actor award between 2012 and 2013, win 4 of those awards.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table from 2012 to 2013 to see if Kristofer Martin is mentioned.\n\nStarting with 2013:\n- In 2013, there are three entries. Looking at the \"nominated for\" column, two of them mention \"oros\". Is \"oros\" Kristofer Martin? I'm not sure, but assuming it refers to him.\n- So, in 2013, he was nominated for two awards and won one.\n\nIn 2012:\n- There are four entries. The third row says \"best performance\" for \"oros\", so again likely Kristofer Martin, which was a nomination.\n- The fourth row mentions \"tween academy : class of 2012\" as the nominated work, so that's another nomination.\n- The fifth row shows a win in the Famas Awards.\n\nWait, but according to the table, in 2013 he has three award entries. If \"oros\" is Kristofer Martin, then he was nominated twice and won once in 2013, making it two wins? Or maybe I miscounted. Let me recount each year:\n\nFor 2013:\n1. Nominated for \"stand out season performer\" - so that's one nomination.\n2. Won the honorable mention for best supporting actor.\n3. Won the best actor in a supporting role.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the table again:\n\nIn 2013, there are three entries:\n- The first row (2013) is a nomination.\n- Second row (2013): \"won\" under result.\n- Third row (2013): \"won\".\n\nSo that would be two wins and one nomination in 2013, but the claim says he was nominated for 7 awards between 2012-2013.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list all nominations and wins:\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n2012:\n- The third row (2012): \"nominated\" in \"best performance\".\n- Fourth row (2012): \"nominated\" in \"new movie actor of the year\".\n- Fifth row (2012): \"won\" in Famas Awards.\n\nSo that's two nominations and one win in 2012.\n\n2013:\n- First row: \"nominated\".\n- Second row: \"won\".\n- Third row: \"won\".\n\nThat's three entries, so two wins and one nomination in 2013.\n\nWait, but the claim says he was nominated for 7 awards between 2012 and 2013. If each year has multiple entries, perhaps adding up:\n\nIn 2012:\n- Nominated twice (best performance and new movie actor).\n- Won once (Famas).\n\nIn 2013:\n- Nominated once (stand out season performer).\n- Won twice (honorable mention and best actor).\n\nSo total nominations: 2 +1=3.\nTotal wins:1 +2=3.\n\nBut the claim says he was nominated for 7 awards, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe each award entry is a separate nomination or win.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each row is an award entry. So in 2012, there are four entries, of which two are nominations and one is a win.\n\nSimilarly, in 2013, three entries: two wins and one nomination.\n\nSo total nominations across both years would be:\n\n2012:\n- Nominated for \"best performance\".\n- Nominated for \"new movie actor\".\n\nThat's two.\n\n2013:\n- Nominated for \"stand out season performer\".\n\nThat's three total nominations.\n\nBut the claim says he was nominated for 7, which is more than that. So perhaps my assumption about \"oros\" being Kristofer Martin is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong in assuming \"oros\" refers to him. Maybe it's a different person. If that's the case, then Kristofer Martin might not be in the table at all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"oros\" isn't his name. So, if he wasn't nominated for any awards in 2012-2013 as per the table, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to determine based on the given table. If Kristofer Martin is not mentioned in any of these entries, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"oros\" is his name. Let me check each row for 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn 2012:\n- Nominated for \"best performance\" (could be him).\n- Nominated as \"new movie actor of the year\".\n- Won Famas Awards.\nSo that's two nominations, one win.\n\nIn 2013:\n- Nominated for \"stand out season performer\".\n- Won honorable mention and best actor in supporting role.\n\nThat's one nomination, two wins.\n\nTotal: three nominations (two in 2012, one in 2013), three wins.\n\nBut the claim says he was nominated for 7 awards between 2012-2013. That doesn't add up, so the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each award entry is a separate award, so in 2012 he has two nominations and one win, in 2013 he has one nomination and two wins. So total of five awards (nominations + wins) across both years, but the claim says seven nominations specifically.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about being nominated for 7 best actor awards between those years. Looking at the table, in 2012 he was nominated twice, and in 2013 once, so three total nominations. But the claim says seven, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe each row counts as one award, regardless of category. So in 2012, four entries: two nominations, one win.\n\nIn 2013, three entries: one nomination, two wins.\n\nSo total awards mentioned are 4+3=7 entries. But the claim says he was nominated for seven awards, which isn't accurate because some are wins and some are nominations.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The key is to see how many times he was nominated for best actor awards between 2012-2013.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nIn 2012:\n- Nominated for \"best performance\" (possibly a supporting role).\n- Nominated as \"new movie actor of the year\".\n\nIn 2013:\n- Nominated for \"stand out season performer\" (which might be a best actor category).\n\nSo that's three nominations.\n\nThe claim says he was nominated for seven, which is more than what's shown here. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"all of kristofer martin's award nomination be for his performance in oros.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various awards, categories, nominated for, and results from 2012 to 2013. Each row represents a different award.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Kristofer Martin\" as the individual whose award nominations should all be related to his performance in \"Oros.\" So I need to check each relevant row where Kristofer is nominated or awarded and see if it's for Orus.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. The name of the person is not directly listed; however, the 'nominated for' column might contain names, which could be Kristofer Martin.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n1. 2013: 1st Sunday All Stars Awards - Stand Out Season Performer - Nominated for none. This doesn't mention Kristofer.\n2. 2013: 16th Long Island International Film Expo - Honorable Mention, Best Supporting Actor - Orus won this. So if Kristofer is Orus, then yes, it's for his performance.\n3. 2013: 10th Golden Screen Awards - Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Orus. Again, assuming Orus is Kristofer, this would be relevant.\n4. 2012: Young Critics Circle Awards - Best Performance - Orus. So yes.\n5. 2012: 28th PMPC Star Awards for Movies - New Movie Actor of the Year - Tween Academy: Class of 2012. This doesn't mention Orus; if Kristofer is not in this, then it's irrelevant.\n6. 2012: Famas Awards - German Moreno Youth Achievement Award - N/A. Not relevant unless Kristofer is N/A, which I doubt.\n7. 2012: 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards - Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching - N/A. Also not relevant.\n\nNow, if all of Kristofer's nominations are for Orus, then the claim should be TRUE only if every time he was nominated, it was for Orus. But looking at 2012: PMPC Star Awards for Movies - New Movie Actor of the Year is for Tween Academy: Class of 2012. If that's not Orus, then that particular award isn't relevant to Orus. Therefore, Kristofer might have a nomination outside of Orus in 2012, which would make the claim FALSE.\n\nSo I need to check if all his nominations are indeed for Orus. From the table:\n\n- In 2013: He won two awards as Orus.\n- In 2012: He also got a Best Performance award as Orus and another nomination as New Movie Actor of the Year, possibly not for Orus.\n\nThus, since there's at least one award (2012 PMPC) that might be outside of Orus, the claim is FALSE. But wait, the claim says \"all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations,\" so if any are not for Orus, then it's false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's a nomination in 2012 PMPC Star Awards that isn't for Orus.\n\nRelevant cells would be all rows where Kristofer is nominated as Orus and the 2012 PMPC row to check if it's not Orus. So I'll include those cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about an award table is true or false. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the table lists various awards given from 2012 to 2013, including details like the awarding body, category, who was nominated for, and the result (whether they won or were nominated). The claim in question says: \"All of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 are based on nomination for a specific show.\"\n\nI need to check each relevant row and column to see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row:\n\n1. **2013 Row:**\n   - The first three rows are from 2013.\n   - In the second row (16th Long Island International Film Expo), Kristofer Martin (aka Kristoffer Martin) was given an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor. So, he didn't win but got a nomination.\n   - The third row (10th Golden Screen Awards) lists him as winning in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role category.\n\n2. **2012 Rows:**\n   - Next, looking at 2012 rows:\n     - The fourth row (Young Critics Circle Awards) shows he was nominated for Best Performance.\n     - The fifth row (28th PMPA Star Awards) lists him as New Movie Actor of the Year, but it's noted as \"nominated.\"\n     - Wait, actually in the table, for 2012, the fifth row under result is \"nominated,\" so he didn't win there.\n     - Then, the sixth row (FAMAS Awards) says he won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. This might not be tied to a specific show's nomination.\n     - The seventh row (1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards) mentions he won for being part of the most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching, but it's also marked as \"won.\"\n\nNow, the claim says all his award wins are based on nominations for specific shows. So, I need to check each win:\n\n- **2013:** He won two awards. For both, was he nominated for a specific show? The second row (honorable mention) is a nomination, but the third row (Golden Screen) is a win. Wait, in 2013, the Golden Screen Award win: was that based on a nomination for a specific show? Looking at the table, yes, it's \"10th Golden Screen Awards\" and category is Best Actor in a Supporting Role. So he was nominated there, then won.\n\n- **2012:** His FAMAS win (sixth row) is unclear because the nominated for field says \"n/a.\" That might mean it wasn't related to a specific show's nomination. Similarly, his 1st Party Pilipinas award also has \"n / a\" for nominated for, which suggests it wasn't tied to a specific show.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says all of his wins are based on nominations for a specific show. But if in 2012, he won two awards without being nominated for specific shows (since one is marked as \"n/a\"), then the claim isn't entirely true.\n\nHowever, looking at the table again:\n\n- In the sixth row (2012 FAMAS), \"nominated for\" is \"n / a,\" which might mean not applicable or that the award wasn't tied to a specific show's nomination. Similarly, the seventh row's \"nominated for\" is also \"n/a.\"\n\nSo, Kristofer Martin won two awards in 2012 where the nominated for field is blank. Therefore, those wins aren't based on nominations for specific shows.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the claim: it says \"all of the award wins.\" So if he has any wins not tied to a specific show's nomination, the claim is false.\n\nSo, in 2012, his FAMAS and Party Pilipinas awards were won without being based on nominations for specific shows. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each of Kristofer Martin's award wins between 2012 and 2013 whether they were based on a nomination for a specific show.\n\n1. **2013:**\n   - He won two awards:\n     - **16th Long Island International Film Expo:** Honorable mention (nomination).\n     - **10th Golden Screen Awards:** Best Actor in a Supporting Role (won after nomination).\n\n2. **2012:**\n   - His wins:\n     - **FAMAS Awards:** German Moreno Youth Achievement Award (\"n / a\" for nominated, not tied to a show's nomination).\n     - **1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards:** Most liked loveteam (not specified as based on a show's nomination).\n\nSince some of his wins in 2012 were not tied to specific shows' nominations, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
