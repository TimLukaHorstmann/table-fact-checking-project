    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Mr Thomas Andrews, Mr Roderick Robert Crispin Chisholm, and Mr William Henry Marsh Parr, all board first class from Belfast.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by breaking down the claim into its components to understand what it's stating. It mentions three individuals: Mr Thomas Andrews, Mr Roderick Robert Crispin Chisholm, and Mr William Henry Marsh Parr. The claim says that all of them \"board first class\" from Belfast.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: name, class, hometown, boarded, and position. My task is to check each person mentioned in the claim against these columns to see if their class is indeed first and if they board from Belfast.\n\nLet's go through each individual one by one.\n\nStarting with Mr Thomas Andrews:\n- In the table, under the \"name\" column, there's an entry: \"andrews , mr thomas\". So that's Thomas Andrews. Looking at his \"class\" column, it says \"first\", which matches what the claim states.\n- His \"hometown\" is Belfast, Ireland, and he boards from Belfast as well. So both conditions are satisfied for him.\n\nNext is Mr Roderick Robert Crispin Chisholm:\n- The table has a row with name: \"chisholm , mr roderick robert crispin\". His class is listed as first, which aligns with the claim.\n- His hometown and boarded locations are also Belfast. So he meets both criteria.\n\nNow, Mr William Henry Marsh Parr:\n- Looking at the table, the entry is \"parr , mr william henry marsh\". His class is first, matching the claim.\n- Both his hometown and boarded fields are Belfast. So he too satisfies both conditions.\n\nSince all three individuals have a class of first and board from Belfast, the claim seems to be supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should also check if there's any discrepancy in the names as they appear in the claim vs the table. The claim lists them with different ordering: \"Mr Thomas Andrews, Mr Roderick Robert Crispin Chisholm, and Mr William Henry Marsh Parr.\" In the table, their order is slightly different but the key identifiers are the same. For example, Mr Thomas Andrews is at row 0, column name as \"andrews , mr thomas\", which matches.\n\nTherefore, all three individuals in the claim have the specified class and boarded from Belfast, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"andrew , mr thomas , chisholm , mr roderick robert crispin , parr , mr william henry marsh all board second class from belfast.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into individual names:\n\n1. Andrew, Mr. Thomas\n2. Chisholm, Mr. Roderick Robert Crispin\n3. Parr, Mr. William Henry Marsh\n\nI need to check each of these individuals in the table and see if they board second class from Belfast.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Andrew, Mr. Thomas is in first class, boards from Belfast.\n- **Row 2**: Chisholm, Mr. Roderick Robert Crispin is in first class, boards from Belfast.\n- **Row 8**: Parr, Mr. William Henry Marsh is in second class, boards from Belfast.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So Andrew and Chisholm are first class, while Parr is second class. The claim says all of them board second class, which isn't true for the first two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. Each of these individuals has a row index:\n\n- Andrew: Row 0\n- Chisholm: Row 2\n- Parr: Row 8\n\nEach of their \"class\" and \"boarded\" columns need to be checked. So I'll extract the class and boarded for each.\n\nFor Andrew (Row 0):\n- Class: first\n- Boarded: belfast\n\nRelevant cells: row_index=0, column_name=\"class\"\n\nFor Chisholm (Row 2):\n- Class: first\n- Boarded: belfast\n\nRelevant cells: row_index=2, column_name=\"class\"\n\nFor Parr (Row 8):\n- Class: second\n- Boarded: belfast\n\nRelevant cells: row_index=8, column_name=\"class\"\n\nWait, the claim says they all board second class. So the relevant cells should include their boarded status as well.\n\nSo for each individual:\n\nAndrew's boarded is first class, so \"boarded\" column is relevant (row 0, column boarded).\n\nChisholm same: row 2, column boarded.\n\nParr: row 8, column boarded.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells will be the rows for these individuals and their respective columns.\n\nSo, compiling all:\n\n- For Andrew: row 0, \"class\" and \"boarded\".\nWait, no. The claim is about both class and boarded. So I need to check that each of them boards second class.\n\nBut for Andrew, he's first class, so his boarding status isn't relevant in terms of the claim, since the claim is incorrect for him, but perhaps we only need to show why it's false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just their class column is enough because the claim says they are all second class, so if any are not, it's false. So for each name, check their class.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- Andrew: row 0, \"class\"\n- Chisholm: row 2, \"class\"\n- Parr: row 8, \"class\"\n\nBut since the claim is about boarding second class, maybe also include boarded. Hmm, perhaps to show that some board first, which contradicts the claim.\n\nBut per instructions, I need to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n\n1. All listed individuals are in second class.\n2. They all boarded from Belfast.\n\nSo for each individual, I need to check if their class is second and boarded is belfast.\n\nBut since Andrew's class is first, that's a contradiction. So the relevant cells would be the class column for all three, and the boarded column for all three.\n\nWait, but the claim is about both boarding second class from Belfast. So each should have:\n\n- class: second\n- boarded: belfast\n\nSo if any of them don't meet these two conditions, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, for each individual, their row index, \"class\", and \"boarded\" are relevant.\n\nBut that might be too much. Let me see: The claim is stating both that they are second class and boarded from Belfast. So to verify, we need to check if each individual has those two attributes. Therefore, the columns to check are:\n\n- For each person: their class (to ensure it's second) and boarded (to ensure it's belfast).\n\nThus, for each relevant person, their row index, \"class\", and \"boarded\" would be the relevant cells.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, only two columns were mentioned. Maybe I need to include all three? Or perhaps just class is sufficient since the claim is about the class.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the instructions:\n\n\"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\"\n\nThe claim has two aspects: class and boarded location. So to check if the claim is true, each individual must have both attributes as stated.\n\nTherefore, to verify, we need to check for both columns for each person.\n\nSo for Andrew, even though his class is first, he's boarding from Belfast. But since his class isn't second, the claim fails.\n\nSimilarly, Chisholm has first class, so same issue.\n\nParr is correct: second class and boards from Belfast.\n\nTherefore, to identify the relevant cells:\n\nEach of the three individuals' row indices, and their \"class\" and \"boarded\" columns.\n\nBut that might be a lot. Alternatively, maybe just their \"class\" column suffices since the claim is incorrect for Andrew and Chisholm.\n\nI think the correct approach is to list all relevant cells that directly relate to the claim's conditions. Since the claim states two things: class and boarded location, we need to verify both for each individual mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\nFor each person:\n- their row index\n- \"class\" column (to check if they are second)\n- \"boarded\" column (to check if they board from Belfast)\n\nSo for Andrew:\n\nrow 0, \"class\", and \"boarded\".\n\nChisholm: row 2, \"class\", and \"boarded\".\n\nParr: row 8, \"class\", and \"boarded\".\n\nBut in the table, some columns have spaces, like \"electrician 's apprentice\". Does that affect anything? Probably not. The key is to get the right column names.\n\nSo I'll list each person's relevant cells accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if all individuals board second class from Belfast. Andrew and Chisholm are first class, making the claim false. The relevant cells include their row indices, \"class\", and \"boarded\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"boarded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"boarded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boarded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
