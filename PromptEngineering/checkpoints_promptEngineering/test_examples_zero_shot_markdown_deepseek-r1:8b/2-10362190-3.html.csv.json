The claim is about an attendance number on a specific date.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"on november 12 , 1995 , there be an attendance of 51342.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the date is November 12, 1995. Let's go through each week:\n\n- Week 1: September 3\n- Week 2: September 10\n- Week 3: September 17\n- Week 4: September 24\n- Week 6: October 8\n- Week 7: October 15\n- Week 8: October 22\n- Week 9: October 30\n- Week 10: November 5\n- Week 11: November 12, 1995\n\nSo that's week 11. Now, I'll check the attendance for that week. The attendance column shows 51342.\n\nThe claim states that on November 12, 1995, the attendance was 51342. That matches exactly with what's in the table. So there's a direct match here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because the attendance figure for November 12, 1995, is indeed 51,342 as listed in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on November 12, 1995, the attendance was 51,342. Looking at the table, week 11 corresponds to November 12, and the attendance for that week is 51,342.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant cells:**  \n- Week 11's attendance column is relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about week 7 and attendance being 55703 is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific week of games, with details about each game.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"during week 7\", so my first task is to find the relevant week in the table that matches week 7. I'll scan through the 'week' column to locate the row for week 7.\n\nLooking at the weeks listed: week 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, etc., I see that week 7 is there on October 15, 1995 against Tampa Bay Buccaneers. So that's the relevant row for week 7.\n\nNext, the claim states that the attendance was 55703 during week 7. I need to check what number is listed under the 'attendance' column for that particular week.\n\nIn the table, under week 7, the attendance is indeed 55703. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other relevant cells needed beyond this one. The only other columns are date and opponent, but those don't pertain to the attendance number. So, the only cell that matters here is the 'attendance' column for week 7.\n\nTherefore, since the claim's number matches exactly with what's in the table, the statement should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because week 7's attendance is exactly 55703.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a team's loss in week 16 against the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 37-30 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"during week 16 , the team lose to the san francisco 49ers wtih a score of 37 - 30.\"\n\nI should check each part of this claim against the table. Let's break it down into parts:\n\n1. Week number: The claim mentions week 16.\n2. Opponent: San Francisco 49ers.\n3. Result: Team loses (so result should be 'l' for loss).\n4. Score: 37 - 30.\n\nNow, I'll refer to the table provided. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week, with corresponding data.\n\nI need to find the row where week is 16. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Chicago Bears.\n- Week 2: Detroit Lions.\n- Week 3: Dallas Cowboys.\n- Week 4: Pittsburgh Steelers.\n- Week 6: Houston Oilers.\n- Week 7: Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n- Week 8: Green Bay Packers.\n- Week 9: Chicago Bears again.\n- Week 10: Green Bay Packers.\n- Week 11: Arizona Cardinals.\n- Week 12: New Orleans Saints.\n- Week 13: Detroit Lions.\n- Week 14: Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n- Week 15: Cleveland Browns.\n- Week 16: San Francisco 49ers.\n\nWait, week 16's opponent is indeed the San Francisco 49ers. So that part matches.\n\nNow, checking the result column for week 16. The result is listed as 'l 37 - 30'. Wait, in the table, the results are sometimes written with an 'l' or 'w' for loss or win. For example, week 1 has 'l 31 - 14', so 'l' indicates a loss.\n\nIn week 16's result, it says 'l 37 - 30'. That means the team lost to the San Francisco 49ers with that score. So the claim states that they lost, which is correct based on the table.\n\nAlso, the score in the claim is 37-30, which matches exactly what's in the table.\n\nSo all parts of the claim check out: week 16, opponent San Francisco 49ers, loss with a 37-30 score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table. Week 16 shows the team lost to the San Francisco 49ers with a 37-30 score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The rows are numbered from 1 to 17, with dates ranging from September 3, 1995, up to December 24, 1995.\n\nI need to identify all games before November 12, 1995. Let me list the weeks that occurred before that date. Week 1 is September 3, then week 2 on September 10, week 3 on September 17, week 4 on September 24, week 6 on October 8 (skipping week 5?), wait, no, looking at the table, week 5 isn't listed. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or missing? But the user provided weeks up to 17, so perhaps week 5 is just not present here.\n\nWait, let me check the weeks again. The table has weeks from 1 to 17 but skips some numbers like week 5 and 13 (which might be a correction). Wait, no, week 6 is October 8. So between September 24 (week 4) and October 8 (week 6), there's a missing week 5. So the games before November 12 would include all weeks from 1 to whatever comes before that date.\n\nLet me list all the rows where the date is before November 12, 1995.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nWeek 1: September 3\nWeek 2: September 10\nWeek 3: September 17\nWeek 4: September 24\nWeek 6: October 8\nWeek 7: October 15\nWeek 8: October 22\nWeek 9: October 30\nWeek 10: November 5 (this is before November 12)\nWeek 11: November 12 (this is the date in question, so up to Week 10)\n\nSo rows up to week 10 are before November 12.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of these weeks have an attendance of 51342.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Week 1: 63036\n- Week 2: 52234\n- Week 3: 60088\n- Week 4: 57853\n- Week 6: 56430\n- Week 7: 55703\n- Week 8: 60332\n- Week 9: 61238\n- Week 10: 62839\n\nNone of these attendances equal 51342.

The claim says, \"before week 16, the score be a loss of 37 - 30.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It mentions \"before week 16,\" which means we're looking at games that occurred in weeks 1 through 15. The result they're referring to is a loss with a score of 37-30.\n\nNext, I'll look into the table provided. Each row represents a different week, from week 1 to week 17. For each week, there's a date, opponent, result, and attendance. My focus should be on the 'result' column for weeks before 16 (i.e., weeks 1-15).\n\nI'll go through each week one by one:\n\nWeek 1: Result is \"l 31 - 14\" \u2013 that's a loss, but not 37-30.\nWeek 2: \"w 20 - 10\" \u2013 win, so doesn't apply.\nWeek 3: \"l 23 - 17 (ot)\" \u2013 loss, but different score.\nWeek 4: \"w 44 - 24\" \u2013 win.\nWeek 6: \"w 23 - 17 (ot)\" \u2013 win.\nWeek 7: \"l 20 - 17 (ot)\" \u2013 loss, not the right score.\nWeek 8: \"l 38 - 21\" \u2013 loss, different score.\nWeek 9: \"l 14 - 6\" \u2013 loss, nope.\nWeek 10: \"w 27 - 24\" \u2013 win.\nWeek 11: \"w 30 - 24 (ot)\" \u2013 win.\nWeek 12: \"w 43 - 24\" \u2013 win.\nWeek 13: \"l 44 - 38\" \u2013 loss, different score.\nWeek 14: \"w 31 - 17\" \u2013 win.\nWeek 15: \"w 27 - 11\" \u2013 win.\n\nLooking through all these results, none of the weeks before week 16 (weeks 1-15) show a game where the result was a loss with a 37-30 score.
