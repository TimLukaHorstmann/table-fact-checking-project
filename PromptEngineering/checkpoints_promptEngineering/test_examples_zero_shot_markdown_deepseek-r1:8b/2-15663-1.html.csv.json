    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"43243 live birth have a migration of -14873\" is true based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"live births.\" Looking at the table, there's a column called \"live births.\" So I should focus on that. The number given in the claim is 43243, so I'll look for rows where the live births are around that number. However, looking at the table, I see that live births range from about 40k to almost 50k. Wait, but the first row's live births are 49,291 and 47,464, which are close to 50k, so maybe I should check if any row has exactly 43,243 live births.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rows:\n\n- The second row has live births of 47,464\n- Third: 45,559\n- Fourth:44,843\n- Fifth:46,370\n- Sixth:43,243\n- Seventh:43,385\n- Eighth:43,112\n- Ninth:42,782\n- Tenth:40,508\n- Eleventh:39,673\n- Twelfth:39,348\n\nSo yes, the sixth row has live births of 43,243. That matches the number in the claim.\n\nNext part of the claim is \"migration of -14873.\" Let me see where migration is recorded. There's a column called \"migration\" which has both positive and negative numbers. The claim says the migration is negative 14,873. So I need to check if any row has a migration value of -14,873.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- First row: -26,342\n- Second: -21,177\n- Third:-18,789\n- Fourth:-18,959\n- Fifth:-19,436\n- Sixth:-14,873\n- Seventh:-13,470\n- Eighth:-13,741\n- Ninth:-14,515\n- Tenth:-9,718\n- Eleventh:-14,488\n- Twelfth:-15,000\n\nYes, the sixth row has a migration of -14,873. That matches exactly.\n\nSo in this specific row (row index 6), both \"live births\" and \"migration\" are as stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in that particular row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"live births\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"migration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
