    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"episode number 202 air on february 4 , 2008.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. My main focus is on verifying two pieces of information from the claim: that the episode number is 202 and that it aired on February 4, 2008.\n\nStarting with the episode number, I need to find if there's an entry where \"episode no\" is 202. Scanning through each row, I see that in row 2 (since the first row is production no 15), the episode no is 202. So, this matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking the airdate for episode number 202. In the same row as episode 202, the original airdate is listed as February 4, 2008. This exactly matches the date in the claim.\n\nNow, I'll cross-check to ensure there's no other entry that might confuse this verification. All other episodes have different numbers and dates, so it seems isolated.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"episode number 202 air on february 4 , 2008,\" we need to check two specific cells in the table:\n\n1. **Episode Number**: Ensure that episode number 202 exists in the table.\n2. **Air Date**: Confirm that episode 202 aired on February 4, 2008.\n\nBoth conditions are met in row 2 (index 1) of the table. Thus, the claim is fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"the title of the episode that aired on March 31, 2008, be 'new york : secret societies'.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant. The key points are the date and the title of the episode. So, looking at the table, I need to find the row where the production no, episode no, original airdate, and episode title match March 31, 2008, specifically.\n\nLet me look through each row:\n\n- Row 15: January 28, 2008 \u2013 not March.\n- Row 16: February 4, 2008 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 17: February 11 \u2013 still early February.\n- Row 18: February 25 \u2013 end of February.\n- Row 19: March 3 \u2013 close but not the 31st.\n- Row 20: March 10 \u2013 yeah, March is there, but not the 31st.\n- Row 21: March 17 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 22: March 24 \u2013 closer.\n- Row 23: March 31, 2008 \u2013 this matches the date in the claim.\n  \nNow, check the episode title for that row. The title is \"new york : secret societies,\" which exactly matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, both the date and the title align with the claim, so it's TRUE. I should list the relevant cells: row index 23 (since it starts counting from 0? Wait, no\u2014the table shows production no starting at 15, but row indices in the instructions are probably 0-based. Let me check the first row: production no 15 is row 0, right? So each row increments by one.\n\nSo, for March 31, 2008, that's row index 22 (since row 23 would be 24th production number). Wait, wait\u2014wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the table has production no from 15 to 27. Each row corresponds to production numbers starting at 15 as the first row? Or is it a different order?\n\nLooking again: The table starts with production no 15 in the first data row, so if I'm using 0-based indexing, the first data row is index 0 (prod 15), then index 1 (prod16), and so on. So March 31, 2008, is production no23, which would be row index22.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- original_airdate: March 31, 2008\n- episode_title: \"new york : secret societies\"\n\nTherefore, in the JSON, I'll list two objects: one for row_index=22 and column_name='original airdate', another for 'episode title'.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the title of the episode that aired on January 28, 2008, was 'Vietnam' and it was hosted by Don Wildman.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. Each row represents an episode with specific details.\n\nI need to find the episode that aired on January 28, 2008. So I'll scan down the 'original airdate' column for that date. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: january 28 , 2008\n- That's production no 15, episode no 201, title 'underground apocalypse', host Don Wildman.\n\nWait, but the claim says the title is 'Vietnam'. Hmm, in row 1, we have February 4, 2008, with production no 16, episode no 202, title 'vietnam' by Don Wildman. So that's a different date than January 28, 2008.\n\nSo the claim is associating the wrong date with the title. The title 'Vietnam' aired on February 4, not January 28. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's mixing up the dates and titles.\n\nAlso, checking the host for January 28, it's Don Wildman, but that doesn't change anything since the host is correct in both cases. But the main issue is the date mismatch.\n\nSo putting it all together, the relevant cells are production no (15), episode no (201), original airdate (january 28 , 2008), and episode title ('underground apocalypse'). These show that on January 28, the episode was titled 'underground apocalypse', not 'Vietnam'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly attributes the wrong title to the correct date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"production no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"episode number 213 air on january 28 , 2008.\" So, I'm looking for an episode with number 213 that aired on January 28, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. The relevant information here is the 'episode no' and 'original airdate'.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match both the episode number 213 and the airdate January 28, 2008.\n\nStarting from row 0: production 15, episode 201, aired on Jan 28, 2008. That's episode 201, not 213, so it doesn't fit.\n\nRow 1: production 16, episode 202, Feb 4, 2008. Not our number or date.\n\nRow 2: production 17, episode 203, Feb 11, 2008. Again, not matching.\n\nRow 3: production 18, episode 204, Feb 25, 2008. Nope.\n\nRow 4: production 19, episode 205, March 3, 2008. Not our target.\n\nRow 5: production 20, episode 206, March 10, 2008. No match.\n\nRow 6: production 21, episode 207, March 17, 2008. Still not there.\n\nRow 7: production 22, episode 208, March 24, 2008. Not it.\n\nRow 8: production 23, episode 209, March 31, 2008. Nope.\n\nRow 9: production 24, episode 210, April 14, 2008. No match.\n\nRow 10: production 25, episode 211, April 21, 2008. Still not there.\n\nRow 11: production 26, episode 212, April 28, 2008. Not our number or date.\n\nRow 12: production 27, episode 213, May 5, 2008. Hmm, this is episode 213, but the airdate is May 5, not January 28. So it's close but doesn't match the date in the claim.\n\nSo, looking through all the rows, there is no episode with number 213 that aired on January 28, 2008. The closest is production 27, episode 213, which aired much later in May.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by any cell in the table. So the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that episode number 213 aired on January 28, 2008. However, checking each row, there's no entry with both the episode number 213 and the airdate of January 28, 2008. The only match is production 27, episode 213, which aired on May 5, 2008. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
