The claim states: \"hani said scored 3 goal total and sabry raheel score 1 goal total.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately.\n\nStarting with Hani Said. I'll search for \"Hani Said\" in the table to find their scoring details. Scanning through the rows, I see that Hani Said is listed as row number 5. In that row, under the 'egyptian premier league' column, it says 3 goals. The next columns are egypt cup (0) and caf champions league (0). Adding these together gives a total of 3 goals for Hani Said. So the first part of the claim is correct.\n\nNext, checking Sabry Raheel. I'll search for \"Sabry Raheel\" in the table. I find him in row number 13. In that row, under egyptian premier league, it's 1 goal. The egypt cup and caf champions league columns are both 0. So the total is 1 goal. Therefore, the second part of the claim is also correct.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

The claim says: \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in more than 1 event.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. The table has columns like egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league, and total. Each row is a different player with their stats across these competitions.\n\nThe key here is \"score in more than 1 event,\" which means the player must have scored in at least two of these events (e.g., both Egyptian Premier League and CAF Champions League). \n\nLooking at each player:\n- Gamal Hamza: He has 1 goal in Egyptian Premier League and 2 in CAF Champions League. So, he scored in more than one event.\n- Junior Agogo: He has 3 goals in Egyptian Premier League and 1 in CAF Champions League. That's two events where he scored, so yes.\nNow, I need to check if any other players have scored in more than one event.\n\nLet me go through each player:\n1. Sherif Ashraf: Only 6 in Egyptian Premier League. No other goals elsewhere. So only one event with goals.\n2. Mahmoud Fathallah: 5 in Egyptian Premier League. No others. One event.\n3. Junior Agogo: As above, two events.\n4. Abdel Halim Ali: 3 in Egyptian Premier League. Only that, so one event.\n5. Hani Said: Same as above.\n6. Shikabala: Also same, three goals in Egyptian Premier League.\n7. Gamal Hamza: Two events with goals.\n8. Ahmed Magdy: 2 goals in Egyptian Premier League. No others. One event.\n9. Mostafa Gaafar: Same as Magdy.\n10. Alaa Kamal: Only one goal.\n11. Mahmoud Samir: One goal.\n12. Ricardo Alves Fernandes: One goal.\n13. Sabry Raheel: One goal.\n14. Wisam El Abdy: One goal.\n15. Amr El-Safty: He has 0 in Egyptian Premier League but 1 in CAF Champions League. So only one event with a goal.\n16. Own Goals: Only one, so not a player.\n\nWait, the own goals are separate and don't count as players scoring, I think.\n\nSo, from this, only Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo have scored in more than one event (both scored in two events each). \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because these two are indeed the only ones who scored in more than one event.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}]}",

The claim says: \"amr el - safty be the only player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant parts of the table. The columns involved are 'egyptian premier league', 'egypt cup', 'caf champions league', and 'total'. But for this claim, we're focusing on the 'egyptian premier league' scores.\n\nIn the table, there's a row for \"amr el - safty\" where the egyptian premier league column is 0. That means he didn't score in that league.

The table shows 3 goals in the egyptian premier league and 0 in the others, so total is 3.\n\nNext, for sabry raheel, looking at the same columns: he has 1 goal in the egyptian premier league and 0 elsewhere, so his total is also 1.\n\nNow, comparing their totals: shikabala has 3 goals, sabry raheel has 1. The difference is 2, which aligns with the claim that shikabala scores 2 more than sabry.\n\nI should make sure there are no other relevant cells beyond these two.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim that \"gamal hamza scored the most goals in the caf champion league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify which columns are relevant. The table has columns for egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league, and total. The claim specifically mentions the \"caf champions league,\" so that's the primary column of interest here. Also, the name of the player in question is gamal hamza.\n\nNow, I'll scan through each row to find where gamal hamza is listed. Looking at the table:\n\n- sherif ashraf: ... 0\n- mahmoud fathallah: ... 0\n- junior agogo: ... 1 (caf champions league)\n- abdel halim ali: ... 0\n- hani said: ... 0\n- shikabala: ... 0\n- gamal hamza: ... 2 in caf champions league\n- ahmed magdy: ... 0\n- mostafa gaafar: ... 0\n- alaa kamal: ... 0\n- mahmoud samir: ... 0\n- ricardo alves fernandes: ... 0\n- sabry raheel: ... 0\n- wisam el abdy: ... 0\n- amr el - safty: ... 1 (caf champions league)\n- own goals: ... 0\n\nSo, gamal hamza has a value of 2 in the caf champions league column. \n\nNext, I need to check if he scored the most goals in that competition. To do this, I'll look at all the players who have non-zero values in the caf champions league column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- junior agogo: 1\n- gamal hamza: 2\n- amr el - safty: 1\n\nNo one else has a higher number than gamal hamza. His score of 2 is higher than 1 for both junior agogo and amr el - safty. Therefore, gamal hamza did indeed score the most goals in the caf champions league.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the one where gamal hamza's row index is 6 (since the table starts at 0; let me count: sherif ashraf is row 0, then each subsequent player increments by 1. So gamal hamza is row 6) in the \"caf champions league\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Gamal Hamza scored 2 goals in the CAF Champions League, which is more than any other player.

The claim says: \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in at least 1 event.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which cells are relevant to this claim. The key points here are \"only\" and \"scored in at least 1 event.\" So I need to look at each player mentioned and see if they scored in any of the competitions listed.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league, and total. The relevant data is under these columns for each player.\n\nLet me start with gamal hamza. In the egyptian premier league column, he has 1 goal, and in the caf champions league, he has 2 goals. So he scored a total of 3 goals across both competitions. That means he scored in at least 1 event, so he qualifies.\n\nNext, junior agogo. He has 3 goals in the egyptian premier league and 1 in the caf champions league, totaling 4 goals. So he definitely scored in at least one event as well.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players besides these two have scored in at least one event. Let's go through each player:\n\n- sherif ashraf: 6 goals in egyptian premier league only.\n- mahmoud fathallah: 5 in egyptian premier league.\n- junior agogo: already covered, 4 total.\n- abdel halim ali: 3 in egyptian premier league.\n- hani said: same as above, 3 goals.\n- shikabala: 3 in egyptian premier league.\n- gamal hamza: covered, 3 total.\n- ahmed magdy: 2 in egyptian premier league.\n- mostafa gaafar: same as ahmed, 2 goals.\n- alaa kamal: 1 goal.\n- mahmoud samir: 1 goal.\n- ricardo alves fernandes: 1 goal.\n- sabry raheel: 1 goal.\n- wisam el abdy: 1 goal.\n- amr el - safty: 0 in egyptian premier league, but 1 in caf champions league.\n- own goals: 1 in egyptian premier league.\n\nWait a minute. The player amr el-safety has 0 in the egyptian premier league and 1 in the caf champions league. So he scored at least one goal as well. That means his total is 1, but it's from the caf champions league. Similarly, own goals have 1 in the egyptian premier league.\n\nSo the claim says \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in at least 1 event.\" But amr el-safety and own goals also scored in at least one event each. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are other players who scored in at least one event besides gamal and junior.\n\nAdditionally, the \"totals\" row shows that total goals across all competitions sum up to 38, which makes sense as it's a combination of individual player goals plus any own goals and possibly others, but for this claim, the key is identifying the relevant players who scored in at least one event.\n\nSo based on the table, amr el-safety and own goals also scored in events, making the original claim false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n]}",

From the table, hani said has a total of 3 goals. That part checks out.\n\nNext, Sabry Raheel's data is on row 12. Looking at his 'total' column, it shows he scored 1 goal. Now, the claim says Sabry scored 1 less than Hani. Since Hani has 3 and Sabry has 1, 3 minus 1 equals 2, which means Sabry scored 2 less, not 1 less. Wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the 'egyptian premier league' or other columns for both players to see if there's a different calculation. But according to the total column, Hani has 3 and Sabry has 1.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's about Gamal Hamza scoring the second highest goal in the CAF Champions League. So, I need to find out how many goals he scored in that competition and see if it's the second highest.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to identify where Gamal Hamza is listed. Scanning down the rows, I spot his name: Gamal Hamza. His row has values for Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, CAF Champions League, and total goals.\n\nIn the column for the CAF Champions League, Gamal Hamza has 2 goals. So that's straightforward\u2014he scored two goals in that competition.\n\nNext, I need to see if he is the second highest scorer. To do this, I should check how many other players scored more than him or if his score is indeed the second highest.\n\nLooking at the same column (CAF Champions League), let me list out all the numbers:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: 0\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: 0\n- Junior Agogo: 1\n- Abdel Halim Ali: 0\n- Hani Said: 0\n- Shikabala: 0\n- Gamal Hamza: 2\n- Ahmed Magdy: 0\n- Mostafa Gaafar: 0\n- Alaa Kamal: 0\n- Mahmoud Samir: 1\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes: 1\n- Sabry Raheel: 1\n- Wisam El Abdy: 1\n- Amr El-Safty: 1\n- Own Goals: 0\n\nWait, that's not all. The last row is \"totals\" which shows the total goals for each category. But I think each player's data is in their respective rows. So looking at the CAF Champions League column:\n\nThe highest score seems to be 2 by Gamal Hamza. Then, Junior Agogo has 1 and several others have 1 as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check again. The CAF Champions League column shows each player's goals in that competition. So the numbers are:\n\nSherif Ashraf: 0\n\nMahmoud Fathallah: 0\n\nJunior Agogo: 1\n\nAbdel Halim Ali: 0\n\nHani Said: 0\n\nShikabala: 0\n\nGamal Hamza: 2\n\nAhmed Magdy: 0\n\nMostafa Gaafar: 0\n\nAlaa Kamal: 0\n\nMahmoud Samir: 1\n\nRicardo Alves Fernandes: 1\n\nSabry Raheel: 1\n\nWisam El Abdy: 1\n\nAmr El-Safty: 1\n\nOwn Goals: 0\n\nSo, the highest is Gamal Hamza with 2. Next, some players have 1. So if someone scored more than him, they would have a higher number. But since he has 2 and others have 1 or 0, it seems his score is the highest in CAF Champions League.\n\nWait, but the claim says he scored the second highest. If there's no one above him with 3 or more, then having 2 would make him the highest, not second. So that might mean the claim is false because he actually has the highest, not second.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me check again: in CAF Champions League column, Gamal Hamza has 2 goals. Are there any players with more than 2? Looking at the list, no one else has more than 1 except him. So he is the highest scorer.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he scored the second highest would be incorrect because he actually scored the highest in CAF Champions League.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes all players who played for Egyptian clubs, and perhaps other players outside this table might have scored higher. But based on the data given, Gamal Hamza has 2, which is more than anyone else here.\n\nSo, the claim is false because he didn't score second; he was first.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"amr el - safty be only 1 of 2 player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the relevant players and their performance in the Egyptian Premier League (EPL). From the table, the EPL column has numbers indicating how many goals each player scored. Let me scan through the row for amr el - safty.\n\nLooking at the \"name\" column, I find \"amr el - safty.\" Now, checking his score in the \"egyptian premier league\" column. It shows 0. So he didn't score any goals there.\n\nThe claim states that he is one of two players who did not score in the EPL. That means there should be exactly one other player who also has a score of 0 in the EPL column.\n\nI'll go through each row to identify all players with a score of 0 in the EPL. Starting from the top:\n\n- sherif ashraf: 6 goals.\n- mahmoud fathallah: 5 goals.\n- junior agogo: 3 goals.\n- abdel halim ali: 3 goals.\n- hani said: 3 goals.\n- shikabala: 3 goals.\n- gamal hamza: 1 goal.\n- ahmed magdy: 2 goals.\n- mostafa gaafar: 2 goals.\n- alaa kamal: 1 goal.\n- mahmoud samir: 1 goal.\n- ricardo alves fernandes: 1 goal.\n- sabry raheel: 1 goal.\n- wisam el abdy: 1 goal.\n- amr el - safty: 0 goals (this is the first player without a goal).\n- own goals: 1 goal (but this might not be a player, so perhaps it's not counted as a player without scoring? Or does it count towards total goals, but not in the individual players' stats.)\n\nWait, the \"own goals\" row has a value of 1. But is that under the EPL column or the egypt cup? Looking at the table headers: \"egyptian premier league,\" so own goals might be a separate category. Maybe it's not relevant to the count of players who didn't score in the EPL, but rather as an additional goal type.\n\nBut back to the main point: how many players have 0 in the EPL column. From what I can see:\n\n- amr el - safty is one.\n- Are there others? Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at \"egyptian premier league\" column:\nsherif ashraf:6, mahmoud fathallah:5, junior agogo:3, abdel halim ali:3, hani said:3, shikabala:3, gamal hamza:1, ahmed magdy:2, mostafa gaafar:2, alaa kamal:1, mahmoud samir:1, ricardo alves fernandes:1, sabry raheel:1, wisam el abdy:1.\n\nWait, I don't see another player with 0 in the EPL column. Amr el - safty is 0, but are there others? Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the \"egyptian premier league\" numbers:\n\n- The row for amr el - safty is 0.\n- Any other players have 0?\n\nI see that all other players in the EPL column have non-zero values except perhaps 'own goals,' but as I thought earlier, maybe it's not a player. So only amr el - safty has 0 in EPL.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table again:\n\nThe table shows the \"egyptian premier league\" column for each player:\n\n- sherif ashraf:6\n- mahmoud fathallah:5\n- junior agogo:3\n- abdel halim ali:3\n- hani said:3\n- shikabala:3\n- gamal hamza:1\n- ahmed magdy:2\n- mostafa gaafar:2\n- alaa kamal:1\n- mahmoud samir:1\n- ricardo alves fernandes:1\n- sabry raheel:1\n- wisam el abdy:1\n- amr el - safty:0\n- own goals:1\n\nSo, only amr el - safty has 0 in EPL. Therefore, there's only one player who didn't score in the EPL, not two as the claim suggests.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014did I miss any players? Let me count again:\n\nPlayers with 0 in EPL: 1 (amr el - safty)\nOthers: all have at least 1 goal except perhaps own goals. But own goals might be a separate category, not an individual player's statistic. So the claim says amr is one of two players who didn't score in EPL. But if only he didn't, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but looking again, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 8: ahmed magdy has 2 goals.\n- Row 9: mostafa gaafar has 2.\n- Row 10: alaa kamal has 1.\n- Row 11: mahmoud samir has 1.\n- Row 12: ricardo alves has 1.\n- Row 13: sabry raheel has 1.\n- Row 14: wisam el abdy has 1.\n\nSo, yes, only amr el - safty is 0. Therefore, the claim says he's one of two players not scoring, but there's only one. So the claim is false.\n\nWait, but wait another thing\u2014the table includes 'own goals' as a row with 1 in EPL. Does that mean that own goals count towards the total, but they're not attributed to any player? Or perhaps it's an additional goal type beyond individual players.\n\nIf own goals are counted separately and don't affect individual player statistics, then only amr el - safty didn't score in the EPL. So the claim is false because there's only one such player.\n\nBut let me think again: does the 'own goals' column affect the count? Because if a goal is an own goal, it's scored by the team but not against another player. But in terms of individual player statistics, they might have 0 or more depending on whether their own goals are included.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the table structure isn't entirely clear. The columns are: egyptian premier league, egypt cup, total goals, etc., and then \"own goals.\" So perhaps 'own goals' is a separate column, not under EPL or Egypt Cup, but its own column with 1.\n\nIf that's the case, then in terms of individual player statistics for the EPL, only amr el - safty has 0. All others have at least 1, and the own goals are an additional category.\n\nSo in that interpretation, the claim is incorrect because only one player didn't score in the EPL, not two. Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether the given statement about Egyptian Premier League (EPL) statistics is accurate. \n\n**Statement:** \"Amr El-Safty is one of two players who did not score a goal in the EPL.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Reviewing Player Statistics:** We examine each player's goals in the EPL.\n   - Sherif Ashraf: 6 goals\n   - Mahmoud Fathallah: 5 goals\n   - Junior Aguilar: 3 goals\n   - Abdel Halim Ali: 3 goals\n   - Hani Al-Masri: 3 goals\n   - Shikabara: 3 goals\n   - Gamal Hamza: 1 goal\n   - Ahmed Magdy: 2 goals\n   - Mostafa Gaafar: 2 goals\n   - Alaa Kamal: 1 goal\n   - Mahmoud Samir: 1 goal\n   - Ricardo Alves: 1 goal\n   - Sabry Raheal: 1 goal\n   - Wisam El-Abdy: 1 goal\n   - Amr El-Safty: 0 goals\n   - Own Goals: 1 (separate category)\n\n2. **Interpretation of Statistics:** \n   - Only Amr El-Safty has a score of 0 in the EPL.\n   - All other players have scored at least one goal.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** The claim is incorrect because there is only one player, Amr El-Safty, who did not score a goal in the EPL. There are no other players besides him with a score of zero.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement is false; Amr El-Safty is actually the sole player who did not score in the EPL.",
