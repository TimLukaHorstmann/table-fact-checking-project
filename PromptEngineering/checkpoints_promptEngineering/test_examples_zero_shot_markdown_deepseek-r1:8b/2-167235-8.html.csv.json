The claim says that bashkim fino's term start is after vilson ahmeti's. But 11 March 1997 is after 10 December 1991. So Bashkim Fino started his term later than Vilson Ahmeti.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the rows to make sure I didn't mix them up. Yes, bashkim fino's term start is indeed later than vilson ahmeti's. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the \"term start\" of Bashkim Fino and Vilson Ahmeti.\n\n- **Bashkim Fino**: 11 March 1997\n- **Vilson Ahmeti**: 10 December 1991\n\nSince 11 March 1997 is after 10 December 1991, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"ilir meta, bashkim fino, ylli bufi and pandeli majko (1st time) be all member of the socialist party of albania political party.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each individual in the claim and check their details from the table.\n\nStarting with ilir meta. Scanning through the table, I find a row where name is \"ilir meta.\" Looking at the columns: born-died is 1969- , term start is 29 october 1999, term end is 22 february 2002, and political party is socialist party of albania. So ilir meta is indeed a member of the socialist party.\n\nNext is bashkim fino. Checking the table for \"bashkim fino,\" his term starts on 11 march 1997 and ends on 24 july 1997. His political party is listed as socialist party of albania. So bashkim fino is also a member of that party.\n\nThen, ylli bufi. In his row, the political party column says \"socialist party of albania.\" So he's part of the same party as well.\n\nLastly, pandeli majko (1st time). His term starts on 2 october 1998 and ends on 29 october 1999. The political party is socialist party of albania.

I need to determine whether the claim about the term ends for Wilson Ahmeti and Ylli Bufi is true based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the term end for Wilson Ahmeti be after the term end for Ylli Bufi.\" So, I need to check when each of their terms ended.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a person with details like name, birth and death years (though that might not be relevant here), and then term start and term end dates. \n\nI'll locate Wilson Ahmeti in the table. Scanning down, I see his row: \"vilson ahmeti\" (note the spelling is \"vilson\" as per the table). His term started on 10 December 1991 and ended on 13 April 1992.\n\nNext, Ylli Bufi's row is next. His term started on 5 June 1991 and ended on 10 December 1991. So, his term end date is earlier than Wilson Ahmeti's term start date. That means Wilson Ahmeti's term began after Ylli Bufi's term had already ended.\n\nWait, but the claim says Wilson Ahmeti's term end is after Ylli Bufi's. But looking at the dates: Wilson's term was from December 1991 to April 1992, and Ylli's term ended in December 1991 as well. So, Wilson's term started in December, right when Ylli's term ended.\n\nSo, technically, Wilson's term end is after Ylli's term end because his term started in the same month that Ylli's ended. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to compare the term end dates of Wilson Ahmeti and Ylli Bufi.\n\n1. **Wilson Ahmeti**:\n   - Term Start: 10 December 1991\n   - Term End: 13 April 1992\n\n2. **Ylli Bufi**:\n   - Term Start: 5 June 1991\n   - Term End: 10 December 1991\n\nSince Wilson Ahmeti's term ended on 13 April 1992, which is after Ylli Bufi's term ended on 10 December 1991, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Sali Berisha be the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is asserting. It's stating that Sali Berisha is the first individual after Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i who has been elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania. So, I should look into their affiliations and the order in which they were elected.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see each person's name, their dates of birth and death (though that might not be directly relevant here), the start and end of their term, and their political party. Sali Berisha is listed with a term from September 11, 2005, to September 15, 2013, and her political party is the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nAleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i served earlier, from April 13, 1992, to March 11, 1997, also affiliated with the Democratic Party. So, Me\u00e7i was an earlier member of that party. The claim says Berisha is the first after Me\u00e7i, so I need to check if there were any other members of the Democratic Party between Me\u00e7i and Berisha.\n\nLooking through the table, after Me\u00e7i's term ended in 1997, the next person listed is Bashkim Fino, who was part of the Socialist Party. Then Fatos Nano (2nd time), also Socialist, followed by Pandeli Majko (1st time) with the Socialist Party. Ilior Meta came next with the Socialist. Then Pandeli Majko again and Fatos Nano again, still Socialists.\n\nSo from 1997 to 2005, when Berisha started her term, all the intervening Prime Ministers were either Socialist or other parties, not Democratic. Therefore, Sali Berisha is indeed the first after Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania. \n\nWait, but I should make sure that there are no others between them. The next person after Me\u00e7i in terms of party affiliation is none, because all subsequent PMs until 2005 were Socialists or non-party, so yes, Berisha is indeed the first.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim means. It seems to state that only one individual has been a member of the Party of Labour of Albania and was elected. So, I need to look through the table to see if there's only one person who fits both being a member of that party and holding an elective position.\n\nLooking at the table column by column, particularly focusing on \"political party\" and whether they were in the Party of Labour of Albania. The relevant column here is \"political party,\" so I'll scan each row to see which ones list \"party of labour of albania.\"\n\nStarting from the top, the first row is a header, so it doesn't count. Then:\n\n- fatos nano (1st time): Party of Labour\n- ylli bufi: Socialist\n- vilson ahmeti: Non-party\n- aleksand\u00ebr meski: Democratic\n- bashkim fino: Socialist\n- fatos nano (2nd time): Socialist\n- pandeli majko (1st time): Socialist\n- ilir meta: Socialist\n- pandeli majko (2nd time): Socialist\n- fatos nano (3rd time): Socialist\n- sali berisha: Democratic\n- edi rama: Socialist\n\nSo, only fatos nano is explicitly listed as a member of the Party of Labour of Albania. Now, I need to check if he was elected. Looking at the \"term start\" and \"term end\" columns:\n\nFor fatos nano (1st time), his term started on 22 Feb 1991 and ended on 5 June 1991. I'm assuming that being a prime minister is an elective position, so yes, he was elected.\n\nNow, are there any other members of the Party of Labour of Albania in the table? From what I can see, no one else is listed as part of that party. Therefore, only one person (fatos nano) fits both conditions: being a member of the Party of Labour and holding an elective position.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure there are no others. Scanning through again:\n\n- fatos nano is the only one in the \"party of labour of albania\" column.\n- Other individuals like ylli bufi, bashkim fino, etc., are part of other parties.\n\nSo yes, only one person meets both criteria.

His details are:\n- Born: 1948 -\n- Term start: 5 June 1991\n- Term end: 10 December 1991\n- Political party: Socialist Party of Albania\n\nNext, Vilson Ahmeti is in row 3:\n- Born: 1951 -\n- Term start: 10 December 1991\n- Term end: 13 April 1992\n- Political party: Non-party\n\nWait a minute. So Ylli Bufi's term started on June 5, 1991, and Vilson Ahmeti's term started on December 10, 1991. That means Ylli's term started earlier than Vilson's.\n\nBut the claim is saying that Ylli's term start was after Vilson's. That seems incorrect because December comes after June. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, checking which cells are relevant. The claim refers to two columns: \"term start\" for both individuals. So I need to extract their term start dates and compare them.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 2 (Ylli Bufi) for \"term start\"\n- Row 3 (Vilson Ahmeti) for \"term start\"\n\nSo, in terms of JSON format, that's row indices 2 and 3 with column names \"term start\".\n\nBut wait, the table starts counting rows from 0.

This already suggests the claim might be FALSE, but I'll check others to be thorough.\n\nNext, bashkim fino: His political party listed in the table is also \"socialist party of albania,\" not democratic. So he's not in the democratic party either.\n\nThen ylli bufi: The table shows his political affiliation as \"socialist party of albania.\" Again, not democratic. So he's out.\n\nLastly, pandeli majko (1st time): His entry in the table states that he is part of the \"socialist party of albania\" during his first term.

Scanning through the table, I see that Ylli Bufi is in the second row, with his term start on June 5, 1991, and term end on December 10, 1991. Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i is listed later, specifically in the fourth row, starting on March 13, 1992, and ending on March 11, 1997.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the table to make sure I didn't misread it. Ylli Bufi's term starts in June 1991 and ends in December 1991. Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i's term starts in April 1992 and ends in March 1997. So, logically, Me\u00e7i's term began after Bufi's term ended because Me\u00e7i started in 1992, which is after Bufi's end in 1991.\n\nBut the claim says that Me\u00e7i's term end is after Bufi's. Looking at the dates, Me\u00e7i ended on March 11, 1997, and Bufi ended on December 10, 1991. So yes, Me\u00e7i's term definitely ends after Bufi's. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n\nI should also make sure that there are no other factors affecting this. For example, if both terms were still ongoing or something, but in this case, they are clearly separated in time. So, I think the conclusion is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the term end dates for Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i and Ylli Bufi.\n\n1. **Ylli Bufi's Term End**: December 10, 1991.\n2. **Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i's Term End**: March 11, 1997.\n\nSince March 11, 1997, is after December 10, 1991, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the \"name\" column, I see that Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i appears in row 4 with the term start and end dates as 13 April 1992 to 11 March 1997. His political party is listed as the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nNext, I need to find out when \"ilir meta\" became a member of the same party. Checking the table again, Ilir Meta appears starting from row 8 with his term start on 29 October 1999. His political party is the Socialist Party of Albania, not the Democratic one. Wait, that's different. The claim mentions he's elected as a member of the Democratic Party, but according to the table, he's part of the Socialist Party.\n\nSo, the key point is whether Ilir Meta was the first after Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i to be elected into the Democratic Party. But from the table, Ilir Meta is in the Socialist Party. The claim might be incorrect because it says he joined the Democratic Party, but he actually joined the Socialist Party.\n\nLooking further down, I see Sali Berisha (row 14) who is part of the Democratic Party, and Edi Rama (still incumbent), also from the Socialist Party. So after Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u0161i, there's no one else in the table until Sali Berisha who is in the same party as Me\u0161i.\n\nWait, no, because Me\u015fi was in the Democratic Party, and later, others like Bashkim Fino, Fatos Nano, etc., are in Socialist. Then Sali Berisha comes back to the Democratic Party after a while. So, perhaps Ilir Meta didn't switch parties; he's always been in the Socialist.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Ilir Meta wasn't elected as part of the Democratic Party but rather the Socialist.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Ilir Meta was elected as a member of the Socialist Party of Albania, not the Democratic Party. The relevant cells are his row and party column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 person have be a member of the socialist party of albania\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that only one person has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania. Looking at the table provided, which lists various individuals along with their terms, political parties, and other details, I need to check how many people are associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0:** This is a header row, so it doesn't list an individual.\n2. **Row 1:** Fatos Nano (first time) is listed as being from the \"party of labour of albania.\" I'm not sure if this is the same as the Socialist Party. The name seems slightly different\u2014\"Labour\" versus \"Socialist.\"\n3. **Row 2:** Ylli Bufi is from the \"socialist party of albania.\" So that's one person.\n4. **Row 3:** Vilson Ahmeti is non-party, so not relevant here.\n5. **Row 4:** Aleksand\u00ebr Meskic is a member of the Democratic Party, so no.\n6. **Row 5:** Bashkim Fino is a Socialist, so that's two people now.\n7. **Row 6:** Fatos Nano (second time) is a Socialist, making it three.\n8. **Row 7:** Pandeli Majko (first time) is a Socialist, four.\n9. **Row 8:** Iliar Meta is a Socialist, five.\n10. **Row 9:** Pandeli Majko (second time) is a Socialist, six.\n11. **Row 10:** Fatos Nano (third time) is a Socialist, seven.\n12. **Row 11:** Sali Berisha is from the Democratic Party, so no.\n13. **Row 12:** Edi Rama is a Socialist, making it eight.\n\nSo, counting them up, there are at least eight individuals who have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania. This contradicts the claim that only one person has been a member.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Rows 2,5,6,7,8,9,10,12\u2014all of these are Socialists. That's eight people. So the claim is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"only 1 person have been a member of the socialist party of albania,\" we need to examine each row in the table to count how many individuals belong to that party.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 2 (Ylli Bufi)\n- Row 5 (Bashkim Fino)\n- Row 6 (Fatos Nano (2nd time))\n- Row 7 (Pandeli Majko (1st time))\n- Row 8 (Iliar Meta)\n- Row 9 (Pandeli Majko (2nd time))\n- Row 10 (Fatos Nano (3rd time))\n- Row 12 (Edi Rama)\n\nEach of these rows lists an individual who is a member of the Socialist Party of Albania, totaling eight members. Therefore, the claim that only one person has been a member is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
