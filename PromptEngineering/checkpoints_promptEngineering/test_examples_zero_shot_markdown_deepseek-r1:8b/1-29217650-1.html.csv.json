    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 28 be p13.6 million.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate this specific information in the table. The table has several columns: movies, december 25, december 26, december 27, december 28, and two other columns that are the totals for dec 25-28 and total 2-week gross.\n\nLooking at the first row of the table under \"movies,\" it says ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) with values p20 million, p18 million, p16.5 million, and p13.6 million across december 25 to 28 respectively. So, the claim is specifically about the figure on december 28 for this movie.\n\nIn the table, each row corresponds to a different movie. The first row is ang tanging ina mo, so that's the one we're interested in. Now, I need to find which cells correspond to december 28 and the revenue figure p13.6 million.\n\nLooking at the columns, december 28 is the fourth column after dec25-28 total. Each movie has a value for december 28, which is the fourth data point. For ang tanging ina mo, the december 28 cell is p13.6 million. \n\nSo, to verify the claim, we need to check two cells: the row for ang tanging ina mo and the specific dec28 column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be row_index 0 (since it's the first row) and column_name \"december 28\". Wait, no, looking at the table structure, each movie is a row with the columns: movies, then dec25 to dec28, then two totals. So, the fourth data point is dec28.\n\nSo, the claim refers to dec28 figure for ang tanging ina mo being p13.6 million. So, relevant cells are:\n\n- The first row (row_index 0), and within that row, the fourth column which is december 28. But looking at the table headers, it's not explicitly named as a separate header beyond \"december 25 - 28 total\". Wait, no\u2014 the columns after movies are dec25, dec26, etc., so each cell under those columns corresponds to their respective dates.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count them:\n\nFor each movie row, the first four cells after \"movies\" are for dec25, dec26, dec27, dec28. Then there's a total of these four, and then the two-week gross.\n\nSo, for ang tanging ina mo, p20 million is dec25, p18 is dec26, p16.5 is dec27, and p13.6 is dec28. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are row 0 (ang tanging ina mo) and the december 28 column data. But since each movie's dec28 figure is a separate cell, I need to specify which columns correspond to those dates.\n\nWait, but looking at the table structure, the columns after \"movies\" are:\n\n- december 25\n- december 26\n- december 27\n- december 28\n- dec25-28 total\n- total 2-week gross\n\nSo, each of these is a separate column. Therefore, for ang tanging ina mo, the cells under december 28 is p13.6 million.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should be:\n\nEach movie's row has five data points: dec25, dec26, dec27, dec28, and two totals. So, to confirm that on dec28, ang tanging ina mo's figure is p13.6, I need to check both the row for that movie and the specific dec28 column.\n\nWait no\u2014 actually, the claim is about the figure on dec28 being p13.6 million, which is a specific cell in the table. So, to verify it, we look at the row for ang tanging ina mo and the cell labeled december 28.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For row_index 0 (ang tanging ina mo), check the \"december 28\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as the table confirms that ang tanging ina mo's figure on December 28 is p13.6 million.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december 28\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 27 be p16.5 million.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate where this information is in the table. The table has movies listed, and under each movie name are several columns like dec25, dec26, etc., up to dec28 and some totals. So, for \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\", I should look at its row.\n\nLooking at the table, the first column is \"movies\", so that's where the movie names are. The next columns are dates: december 25, 26, 27, 28, and totals. So for each movie, there's a row with their respective revenues on these dates.\n\nThe claim mentions December 27 specifically, so I need to check which column corresponds to dec27. The table shows that the fourth column is dec27. Let me make sure: looking at the headers, it's december25, then 26, 27, 28, then totals. So yes, dec27 is the third column after date.\n\nNow, for \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\", I need to find its row and check the value under dec27. Looking through each row:\n\n1. ang tanging ina mo: the first row. Its dec25 is 20 million, dec26 is 18 million, dec27 is 16.5 million. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not confusing rows. The table starts with \"ang tanging ina mo\" as the first movie. So row index 0 corresponds to that movie. Then each column after that is dec25, 26, 27, 28, and then totals.\n\nSo for row 0, column 3 (since dec25 is column1, dec26 col2, dec27 col3). The value is p16.5 million, which matches the claim. \n\nTherefore, the figure on december 27 is indeed p16.5 million for that movie.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the table shows that \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" has a revenue of p16.5 million on december 27.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"dec27\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the movie rosario earn p3.2 million on december 25.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part of the claim means. The movie in question is \"rosario,\" and it earned p3.2 million specifically on December 25th.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different movie, with columns for each day from December 25 to 28, as well as some totals. So, I need to look for the row where the movie is \"rosario.\"\n\nScanning through the rows:\n\n1. ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!') - p20 million on Dec 25\n2. dalaw - p12.5 million on Dec 25\n3. father jejemon - p1.4 million on Dec 25\n4. rosario - p3.2 million on Dec 25\n5. rpg : metanoia - p5.1 million on Dec 25\n6. shake, rattle & roll xii - p11.8 million on Dec 25\n\nSo, the fourth row is for \"rosario,\" and under December 25, it's p3.2 million. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI also need to check if any other cells are relevant beyond this one. The claim mentions earning on December 25th, so I should consider the specific day's column but not necessarily the total or any other days. However, since the claim is about a specific figure for that date, only the cell for December 25 under \"rosario\" is relevant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified with the relevant data from the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"December 25\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a movie's gross figures is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the film for december 25 with a figure of p5.1 million total p15.3 million for the december 25 - 28 total.\" So, they're talking about a movie that had a certain revenue on December 25 and an accumulated total from the 25th to 28th of p15.3 million.\n\nLooking at the table structure: It's a markdown table with columns like movies name, then each day (december 25 to december 28), followed by two totals: \"december 25 - 28 total\" and \"total 2 - week gross\". Each row represents a different movie.\n\nMy task is to find out which rows correspond to the claim. Let's parse the claim:\n\n1. The film for December 25 with p5.1 million.\n2. This film's December 25-28 total is p15.3 million.\n\nSo, I need to locate the row where the December 25 figure is p5.1 million and check if the \"december 25 - 28 total\" column has p15.3 million for that row.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- The first row after headers is \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" with dec25: p20M, which doesn't match.\n- Next, \"dalaw\": dec25: p12.5M \u2013 not matching.\n- Then \"father jejemon\": dec25: p1.4M \u2013 nope.\n- \"rosario\": dec25: p3.2M \u2013 no.\n- \"rpg : metanoia\": dec25: p5.1M \u2013 this matches the first part of the claim.\n- \"shake, rattle & roll xii\": dec25: p11.8M \u2013 not relevant.\n- \"si agimat at si enteng kabisote\": dec25: p31M \u2013 nope.\n\nSo, the row for \"rpg : metanoia\" has the correct December 25 figure of p5.1 million. Now, I need to check if their \"december 25 - 28 total\" is p15.3 million.\n\nLooking at that same row:\n\n- dec25: p5.1M\n- dec26: p4.8M\n- dec27: p3.5M\n- dec28: p1.9M\n\nNow, adding these up: 5.1 + 4.8 + 3.5 + 1.9 = let's compute that.\n\n5.1 + 4.8 is 9.9, plus 3.5 makes 13.4, plus 1.9 is 15.3 million. So yes, the total is p15.3 million as stated in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, there's another column called \"total 2 - week gross.\" For this movie, it's p27 million. But the claim doesn't mention that part, so we don't need to check it unless the claim refers to it. Since the claim only mentions December 25 and the four-day total, that's all that matters.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are met: the film for December 25 with p5.1 million has a four-day total of p15.3 million.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the relevant cells in the table. The movie \"rpg : metanoia\" has a December 25 figure of p5.1 million and a four-day total of p15.3 million.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"december 25\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"december 25 - 28 total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The rows represent different films.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"father jejemon\" earning p1.4 million on December 27. So I should focus on that row in the table. \n\nLooking at the row for father jejemon, the numbers are:\n- december 25: p1.4 million\n- december 26: p1.2 million\n- december 27: p0.8 million\n- december 28: p0.6 million\n\nWait a minute, the claim says p1.4 million on December 27, but according to the table, on that date, father jejemon earned p0.8 million, not p1.4 million. That seems like a discrepancy.\n\nSo, does this mean the claim is false? Because the amount mentioned doesn't match the actual figure in the table for that specific date. \n\nBut I should also check if there's another angle.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in front of me, and I need to determine whether the claim is true or false. The claim is that \"p18 million be the figure for rosario on december 27.\" Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate where \"rosario\" is in the table. Looking at the first column labeled \"movies,\" I see entries like \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!),\" \"dalaw,\" and so on. Scanning through, I find \"rosario\" as one of the rows. So that's row 3.\n\nNow, the claim is specifically about December 27th. Looking at the table headers, there are columns for different dates: december 25, 26, 27, 28. So December 27 is the third column in the table.\n\nI need to check what value is in the \"rosario\" row under the \"december 27\" column. From the table:\n\n- The row for \"rosario\" has values p3.2 million on december25, p2.5 million on december26, and p2.1 million on december27.\n\nWait, so December 27th figure is p2.1 million? But the claim says it's p18 million. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in reading the table.\n\nLet me double-check. The row for \"rosario\" shows:\n\n- december25: p3.2 million\n- december26: p2.5 million\n- december27: p2.1 million\n- december28: p1.4 million\n\nSo on December 27, it's indeed p2.1 million. But the claim says p18 million. That's a big discrepancy.\n\nWait, could there be another row named \"rosario\" that I'm missing? Let me check again. The rows are ang tanging ina mo, dalaw, father jejemon, rosario, rpg : metanoia, shake , rattle & roll xii, and si agimat at si enteng kabisote. So only one row for \"rosario.\"\n\nAnother possibility is that the claim might be confusing \"december 27\" with another date or perhaps misreading the figure. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct column.\n\nYes, December 27 is the third column after dates. So for \"rosario,\" the figure on december27 is p2.1 million. Therefore, the claim that it's p18 million is false.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the row index? Let me count again: row 0 is ang tanging ina mo..., row 1 is dalaw, row 2 is father jejemon, row 3 is rosario. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the figure for \"rosario\" on december27 was p18 million in another month or year? But the table is specific to December 25-28, so no, it's within this time frame.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"p18 million be the figure for rosario on december 27.\" Checking the table, under \"rosario,\" the value for December 27 is p2.1 million, not p18 million. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"december 27\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
