    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the team 's score against detroit be w 97 - 72 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a game where the team scored 97 against Detroit in overtime (OT). I need to check if such a game exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details: game number, date, opposing team, score, etc. The column for the score is labeled \"score\" and shows the result of each game.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the opposing team is Detroit and see what the score was.\n\nRow 19: Opponent is Detroit. The score is w 97 - 72 (ot). That's exactly what the claim says. So this seems to match.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other games against Detroit in case there's more than one. Scanning through, I see that row 19 is the only one where the opponent is Detroit with a score of w 97 -72 (ot). The other rows have different opponents like Cleveland, Atlanta, etc.\n\nSo since row 19 matches the claim exactly, the statement should be TRUE. The relevant cells are the game number (row_index 19) and the \"score\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 19 under the \"score\" column, which matches the described outcome against Detroit.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
