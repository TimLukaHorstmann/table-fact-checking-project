    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the home team, fitzroy, lose to the away team, south melbourne, 12.15 (87) to 11.22 (88).\"\n\nI'll break down each part of the claim and see if it matches the data in the table.\n\nThe home team is Fitzroy, so I need to find their row in the table. Looking at the 'home team' column, Fitzroy is listed as the first entry with a score of 11.22 (88). The away team in this row is South Melbourne, with a score of 12.15 (87).\n\nWait, the claim says that Fitzroy loses to South Melbourne, but according to the scores, Fitzroy has 11.22 and South Melbourne has 12.15. In Australian rules football, the team with the higher score wins. So, if South Melbourne scored more, they would be the winners, meaning Fitzroy lost.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not misunderstanding anything. The claim states that Fitzroy loses, so their score should be lower than the away team's score. In this case, 11.22 (88) for Fitzroy and 12.15 (87) for South Melbourne. Wait a minute, South Melbourne has 12.15, which is 145 points, and Fitzroy has 88 points. So yes, South Melbourne scored higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Fitzroy lost to South Melbourne with those scores seems correct because Fitzroy's score is lower than South Melbourne's. However, I notice that in the table, the venue for this game was junction oval on May 15, 1976, and the crowd was about 11,267 people.\n\nNow, checking the relevant cells: The home team is Fitzroy, so the row index would be 0 (since it's the first entry). The columns we need are 'home team', 'away team', 'home team score', and 'away team score'. So for this comparison, those four columns are relevant.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is correct because Fitzroy did lose to South Melbourne with those scores. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 0 and columns as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that the crowd for the game on May 15, 1976 between Carlton and Richmond was 30,095.\n\nFirst, I should locate the specific parts of the table related to this claim. Let me look at each row in the table to see if it matches the description given in the claim.\n\nLooking at the \"home team\" column: The first two rows are fitzroy and carlton, but then the third is melbourne, fourth geelong, fifth st kilda, and sixth collingwood. So, I'm looking for a game where the home team is Carlton.\n\nIn row 1, the home team is fitzroy; in row 2, it's Carlton. That seems relevant because the claim mentions Carlton as one of the teams.\n\nNext, the away team: The claim says Richmond, so I need to check if that's the away team in any row where the home team is Carlton.\n\nLooking at row 2, the away team is Richmond, which matches the claim. So, this row (row index 1) is relevant because it has both the correct home and away teams.\n\nNow, checking the crowd number: In row 2, the crowd is listed as 30095.

The claim is: \"the crowd for the game on may 15 1976 between melbourne and hawthorn be 25876\". \n\nFirst, I'll parse this claim to identify the key components. The claim mentions a specific date (May 15, 1976), two teams (Melbourne and Hawthorn), and an expected crowd number of 25,876.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game between a home team and an away team, along with their scores, the venue, the crowd size, and the date. My task is to find the row where both the home team and the away team match those in the claim and then check the crowd number.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for the presence of Melbourne as the home team or Hawthorn as either the home or away team on May 15, 1976.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Home team: Fitzroy\n- Away team: South Melbourne\n- Date: 15 May 1976\n\nThis doesn't match our claim because neither team is Melbourne nor Hawthorn.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home team: Carlton\n- Away team: Richmond\n- Date: 15 May 1976\n\nAgain, not matching the teams in question.\n\nThird row:\n- Home team: Melbourne\n- Away team: Hawthorn\n- Date: 15 May 1976\n\nThis matches both the home and away teams as per the claim. Now, I'll check the crowd number for this specific game. The crowd listed here is 25,876, which exactly matches the claim.\n\nFourth row:\n- Home team: Geelong\n- Away team: Footscray\n- Date: 15 May 1976\n\nNot relevant to our teams.\n\nFifth row:\n- Home team: St Kilda\n- Away team: Essendon\n- Date: 15 May 1976\n\nNo match.\n\nSixth row:\n- Home team: Collingwood\n- Away team: North Melbourne\n- Date: 15 May 1976\n\nAgain, not matching the required teams.\n\nSo, only the third row matches both the home and away teams as per the claim.

The claim mentions three key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Date**: May 15, 1976\n2. **Teams**: Geelong (home team) vs. Footscray (away team)\n3. **Crowd Size**: 30,395\n\nSo I'll start by identifying which rows in the table match these criteria.\n\nEach row represents a game, with columns for home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne on May 15, 1976. The crowd is 11,267. Not our game.\n- **Row 1**: Carlton vs. Richmond on May 15, 1976. Crowd is 30,095. Not matching the team names either.\n- **Row 2**: Melbourne vs. Hawthorn on May 15, 1976. Crowd is 25,876. No match.\n- **Row 3**: Geelong vs. Footscray on May 15, 1976. Crowd is 30,395. This matches all criteria.\n- **Row 4**: St Kilda vs. Essendon on May 15, 1976. Crowd is 19,864.

The claim says, \"the crowd for the game on May 15, 1976 between Collingwood and North Melbourne be 34051.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. I'm looking for the crowd number for a specific game that happened on May 15, 1976, involving Collingwood as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it's structured with several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game.\n\nI'll need to check each row to find the one where the home team is Collingwood and the away team is North Melbourne, and then see what the crowd number was for that specific game on May 15, 1976.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Home team - Fitzroy, away team - South Melbourne. Not relevant because the home team isn't Collingwood.\n\nRow 1: Home team - Carlton, away team - Richmond. Again, not our teams.\n\nRow 2: Home team - Melbourne, away team - Hawthorn. Not matching.\n\nRow 3: Home team - Geelong, away team - Footscray. Still not.\n\nRow 4: Home team - St Kilda, away team - Essendon. Nope.\n\nRow 5: Home team - Collingwood, away team - North Melbourne. This looks promising because it matches both teams in the claim.\n\nNow, I should check the date for this row. The date is listed as \"15 may 1976.\" That's exactly what the claim mentions, so that part checks out.\n\nThe crowd number for this specific game (Collingwood vs. North Melbourne) is listed as 34051. The claim states the same number, so it matches.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows that might fit, but given the structure of the table and the specific team names, only Row 5 fits both the home and away teams mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim align with the information in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the crowd size is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the crowd for the game on 15 may 15 , between melboume and hawthom be 25876.\" Hmm, I notice a few things here. The date is written as \"15 may 15,\" which seems off because it looks like there might be a typo. Normally, dates are formatted with the day first, then month, then year. So \"15 May 1976\" makes sense from the table's data. But the claim says \"15 may 15,\" which I think is incorrect.\n\nNext, looking at the teams involved: melboume and hawthom. In the table, there are two clubs named melbourne and hawthorn. So it seems like the claim has a typo here as well. The correct names in the table are \"melbourne\" and \"hawthorn,\" without the 'b' in \"melboume\" or 'o' in \"hawthom.\" \n\nNow, checking the date column in the table: I see that all the games listed have a date of \"15 may 1976.\" The claim mentions May 15, which is a different format but probably refers to May 15, 1976. So that part might still check out.\n\nLooking for the crowd size: the claim states it's 25876. Scanning the table, I see that melbourne's game against hawthorn has a crowd of 25876. That matches exactly with the figure in the claim.\n\nWait, but there are two potential issues here: typos in the team names and possibly an incorrect date format. However, when verifying claims, we focus on whether the numerical values match, not necessarily the formatting of text unless specified otherwise. Since the crowd number is 25876 and that's present for melbourne vs. hawthorn, the numeric part is correct.\n\nSo, despite the minor typos in team names and date format, the crowd size figure is accurate. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the crowd number matches.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because the crowd size of 25876 matches the game between melbourne and hawthorn on May 15, 1976.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the home team, carlton, lose to the away team richmond, 9.15 (69) to 21.14 (140).\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of this claim correspond to cells in the table. Let me break down the claim into key points:\n\n1. Home team: Carlton.\n2. Away team: Richmond.\n3. Score: Carlton's score is 9.15 (69), and Richmond's score is 21.14 (140).\n\nI'll start by finding where Carlton is the home team in the table. Looking at the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. The first column is \"home team\" and the second is \"home team score.\" \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team Fitzroy, score 11.22 (88)\n- Row 1: Home team Carlton, score 21.14 (140)\n- Row 2: Melbourne\n- Row 3: Geelong\n- Row 4: St Kilda\n- Row 5: Collingwood\n\nSo, Carlton is the home team in row 1. Now, checking their score: it's 21.14 (140). The claim says Carlton scored 9.15 (69), which doesn't match. That might be a red flag.\n\nNext, the away team is Richmond. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Away team South Melbourne\n- Row 1: Away team Richmond\n- Row 2: Away team Hawthorn\n- Row 3: Away team Footscray\n- Row 4: Away team Essendon\n- Row 5: Away team North Melbourne\n\nSo, in row 1, the away team is Richmond. Their score is 9.15 (69). The claim says Richmond scored 21.14 (140), which doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute. There's a contradiction here. According to the table, Carlton as the home team scored 21.14 (140) and Richmond as the away team scored 9.15 (69). But the claim states that Carlton lost with a lower score of 9.15 (69) to Richmond's higher score of 21.14 (140).\n\nSo, in the table, Carlton has the higher score, which would mean they won, not lost. The claim is stating the opposite. Therefore, the claim's assertion that Carlton lost is incorrect.\n\nBut let me double-check the scores again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. \n\nIn row 1:\n- Home team: Carlton\n- Score: 21.14 (140)\n- Away team: Richmond\n- Score: 9.15 (69)\n\nYes, that's correct. So Carlton scored more points than Richmond and thus should have won, not lost.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states that Carlton lost when they actually won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Carlton lost to Richmond based on their scores. The table shows Carlton as the home team with a higher score of 21.14 (140) against Richmond's score of 9.15 (69). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's about the attendance (crowd) at a specific football match between St Kilda and Essendon on May 15, 1976, and the number given is 19,864.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details such as home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date.

Then, check the crowd number for that specific game.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Fitzroy vs South Melbourne**: Fitzroy is the home team, so this isn't the game we're looking for.\n2. **Carlton vs Richmond**: Carlton is home, not St Kilda or Essendon.\n3. **Melbourne vs Hawthorn**: Same here, not the teams in question.\n4. **Geelong vs Footscray**: Geelong and Footscray are the teams; not relevant.\n5. **St Kilda vs Essendon**: This looks promising because the home team is St Kilda, and the away team is Essendon.

Specifically, I should focus on the \"crowd\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Home team: Fitzroy (row 0)\n- Away team: South Melbourne (row 0)\n- Date: May 15, 1976 (row 0)\n- Crowd: 11267 (row 0)\n\nAll these elements in row 0 match the claim. Therefore, the crowd number is indeed 11,267 on that specific date and for that particular game.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
