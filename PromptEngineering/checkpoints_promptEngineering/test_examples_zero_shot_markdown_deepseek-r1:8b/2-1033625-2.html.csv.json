    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the score for March 24, 1982 be 1 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table to find any matches where the date is March 24, 1982. Let me go row by row.\n\nLooking at the first column, which is the date. The rows are:\n\n1. 27 March 1974\n2. 4 September 1974\n3. 28 September 1974\n4. 16 March 1975\n5. 24 September 1975\n6. 15 October 1975\n7. 22 September 1976\n8. 13 October 1976\n9. 10 November 1976\n10. 5 December 1976\n11. 15 December 1976\n12. 30 April 1977\n13. 24 August 1977\n14. 15 February 1978\n15. 3 June 1978\n16. 7 June 1978\n17. 21 June 1978\n18. 30 August 1978\n19. 28 March 1979\n20. 29 August 1979\n21. 17 October 1979\n22. 15 November 1980\n23. 28 May 1981\n24. 17 June 1981\n25. 24 March 1982\n26. 21 June 1982\n\nWait, I see a row with the date \"24 March 1982\" at position 25 (if we start counting from 0, it's index 25). Now, I need to check what the score is for that particular row.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column for that date: It says \"1 - 1\". So the score is indeed 1-1. \n\nNext, I should verify if there are any other relevant cells beyond the date and score columns. The claim mentions checking all conditions in the claim against the table. Since the claim only refers to the score being 1-1 on that specific date, the relevant cells would be the ones containing \"date\" as March 24, 1982, and \"score\" as 1 - 1.\n\nWait, but the user's example includes both row_index and column_name. So for the date, it's at row index 25 (assuming rows are 0-based), and the column is \"date\". For the score, it's also at row index 25, column \"score\".\n\nSo I need to include both of these in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific score at a venue is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the score at the venue of praterstadion , vienna at the euro 1980 qualifier be 4 - 0\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The venue in question is \"praterstadion , vienna\", and it's related to the \"euro 1980 qualifier\". The score being claimed is \"4 - 0\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. I need to scan through these rows to find any that match all three criteria: venue is Praterstadion in Vienna, the competition is Euro 1980 qualifier, and the score is 4-0.\n\nI'll start by examining each row one by one to see if it fits.\n\n1. The first few rows don't mention \"euro 1980 qualifier\" or are about different competitions like friendly matches.\n2. Moving down, I notice a row with date 29 august 1979 and venue Praterstadion, Vienna. The competition is \"euro 1980 qualifier\", the score is 4 - 0. This seems to match exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there are no other rows that fit as well. Scanning further, I see a row on 17 October 1979 at Hampden Park with Euro 1980 qualifier, but the score isn't 4-0. Then in May and June 1981, there's another Praterstadion match for 1982 World Cup Qualifier, which is a different competition.\n\nSo only one row matches: the one on 29 August 1979 at Praterstadion, Vienna, with Euro 1980 qualifier and score 4-0. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other relevant rows. Let me double-check each row carefully:\n\n- The last row before 1980 is in August 1979, which matches.\n- No other Praterstadion, Vienna entries for Euro 1980 are present except that one.\n- All other scores at that venue either don't match the competition or the score.\n\nSo yes, it's correct. The relevant cells are where the row index is 28 (assuming rows start at 0; let me check). Wait, looking back, each row has a unique index starting from 0. Let me count:\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, the first entry is at row_index 0: \"praterstadion , vienna\" on 15 November 1980 with score 5-0 for World Cup Qualifier. Then later, there's another Praterstadion entry on May 28, 1981, then again on June 17, 1981, and again in March 1982.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me recount the table:\n\nLooking at each row with \"Praterstadion , vienna\" as venue:\n\n- Row 14: November 15, 1980 \u2013 5-0, Euro 1980 qualifier? No, it's World Cup.\nWait no, in the table, let me check again:\n\nRow index 0: date 15 Nov 1980, Praterstadion, score 5-0, competition 1982 world cup qualifier.\n\nThen row 14 (I think I might be mixing up indices; perhaps better to list all relevant rows):\n\nWait, the user provided a table with multiple entries. Let me parse it correctly:\n\nThe table starts from 15 Nov 1980 as row index 0? Or does each row have an implicit index based on their order?\n\nIn any case, I need to find the exact row where venue is Praterstadion, Vienna, competition is Euro 1980 qualifier, and score is 4-0.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 18: 29 August 1979 \u2013 venue Praterstadion, Vienna; competition Euro 1980 qualifier; score 4-0. Yes, that's the one.\n\nSo in the JSON output, I need to specify the row_index and column_name for each relevant cell. Since it's a single match, there's only one relevant cell.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE with that single relevant cell.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"On April 30, 1977, Stadion Lehen, Salzburg have a score of 1-0, 2-0, 0-3, 4-0, 6-0, and 8-0 for the 1978 World Cup qualifier.\"\n\nFirst, I should check if there's an entry in the table for April 30, 1977, at Stadion Lehen, Salzburg. Looking through the table, yes, on that date there are multiple games listed with the same venue and competition.\n\nNext, I need to look specifically at the scores mentioned in the claim. The scores given are 1-0, 2-0, 0-3, 4-0, 6-0, and 8-0, all marked as \"1978 world cup qualifier.\" \n\nNow, checking each relevant row for April 30, 1977:\n\nRow 14: 1-0 score vs. 9-0 result, but it's a World Cup qualifier.\nWait, that doesn't match the scores listed in the claim.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check all rows with the same date and venue. Looking through row indices:\n\n- Row 14: score 1-0, result 9-0\n- Row 15: score 2-0, result 9-0\n- Row 16: score 3-0, result 9-0\n- Row 17: score 4-0, result 9-0\n- Row 18: score 6-0, result 9-0\n- Row 19: score 8-0, result 9-0\n\nWait a minute, these are all different from the scores in the claim. The claim mentions several specific scores like 1-0, 2-0, etc., but in reality, the scores for that date are all leading to a 9-0 result.\n\nThis means none of the scores listed in the claim match the actual scores in the table. So the claim is not supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's specific scores do not match any entries in the table on April 30, 1977, at Stadion Lehen, Salzburg. The scores listed are all 9-0, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
