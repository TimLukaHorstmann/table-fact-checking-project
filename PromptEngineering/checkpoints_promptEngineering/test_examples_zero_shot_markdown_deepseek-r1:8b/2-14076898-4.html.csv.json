    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"when the goal difference be 11 - 71 the point be 0.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table carefully. It has several columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. Each row represents a different scenario with varying numbers in these columns.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two things:\n1. The goal difference is 11 - 71.\n2. The points are 0.\n\nI should check if there's any row where both of these conditions are met. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and see what the goal difference is and the corresponding points.\n\nRow 0: GD is 51-10=41, points=12 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 1: GD=40-13=27, points=12 \u2192 No.\nRow 2: GD=41-19=22, points=10 \u2192 No.\nRow 3: GD=34-25=9, points=7 \u2192 No.\nRow 4: GD=36-29=7, points=7 \u2192 No.\nRow 5: GD=32-27=5, points=6 \u2192 No.\nRow 6: GD=17-68=-51, points=2 \u2192 No.\nRow 7: GD=11-71=-60, points=0 \u2192 Yes!\n\nSo in row 7, the goal difference is indeed 11 -71 which equals -60, and the points are 0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a row where when the goal difference is 11-71 (or -60), the points are 0.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells. The row in question is index 7, and the columns involved are \"goal difference\" and \"points\". So I'll include both their row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 7 where the goal difference is 11-71 and points are 0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"when the point be 12 the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It seems to say that when the points column equals 12, there are two corresponding goal differences: one is 51-10 and another is 40-13.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"points\" column has values from 0 to 12. So, I need to find all rows where the points column is exactly 12. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: points = 12. The goal difference here is 51 -10.\n2. Row 1: points = 12. The goal difference here is 40 -13.\n3. Rows 2 to 7 have points less than or equal to 12, but I'm focusing only on when the points are exactly 12.\n\nSo, in row 0, the \"goal difference\" column shows 51-10. In row 1, it's 40-13. These match the values stated in the claim.\n\nI need to ensure that all conditions of the claim are met. The claim specifies both 51-10 and 40-13 as goal differences when points are 12.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"there be never a time when point be greater than 12 and only 1 occasion when the point be less than 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part means.\n\nThe first part says that points are never greater than 12. So I need to check all the 'points' column values in the table. Let me look at each row:\n\nRow 0: Points = 12\nRow 1: Points = 12\nRow 2: Points = 10\nRow 3: Points = 7\nRow 4: Points = 7\nRow 5: Points = 6\nRow 6: Points = 2\nRow 7: Points = 0\n\nLooking at these, the highest points are 12. So yes, there's no instance where points exceed 12. That part of the claim holds.\n\nNext, the second part says only one occasion when points are less than 2. Checking the 'points' column again:\n\nPoints less than 2 would be row 6 with 2 points and row 7 with 0 points. Wait, but 2 is not less than 2; it's equal to 2. So actually, there are zero occasions where points are less than 2 because only the last row has 0, which is less than 2, but the sixth row has exactly 2.\n\nWait, the claim says \"less than 2,\" so strictly less than 2. That would mean points must be 1 or lower. Looking at the table:\n\nOnly row 7 has points equal to 0, which is less than 2. The other rows either have 12, 12, 10, 7, 7, 6, and 2. So only one occurrence where points are less than 2.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the sixth row (row 6) has points = 2. Since it's equal to 2, not less than, that doesn't count. So yes, only one occasion when points are less than 2.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are true based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all rows in the 'points' column because they directly affect the conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table has several columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. The claim says, \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\"\n\nAlright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim fully. It's talking about three instances where a team drew their games (drawn column) and had specific goal differences: 34-25 and 36-29. Wait, that part is a bit confusing because the goal difference is given as two separate numbers in each row. For example, one row shows a goal difference of 51 - 10, which I think means the team scored 51 goals and conceded 10, resulting in a positive goal difference of 41.\n\nSo the claim is looking for three rows where the team drew their games (drawn is 1), and then within those, specifically checking if any of them have a goal difference that includes 34-25 or 36-29. But wait, each row only has one goal difference number. So maybe the claim is saying that in those three drawn games, there are two instances where the goal difference is either 34-25 or 36-29.\n\nWait no, perhaps the claim is a bit off. Let me read it again: \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\" So maybe the claim is stating that there are three instances where the team drew and also had either 34-25 or 36-29 as their goal difference. Or perhaps it's looking for exactly two such instances within three drawn games.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row where 'drawn' is 1 because the claim mentions \"a team drew.\" So let me go through the rows one by one.\n\nRow 0: games=7, drawn=0. Not relevant.\nRow 1: games=7, drawn=0. Not relevant.\nRow 2: games=7, drawn=0. Not relevant.\nRow 3: games=7, drawn=1. Relevant because the team drew. The goal difference is 34-25. So that's one occurrence.\nRow 4: games=7, drawn=1. Goal difference is 36-29. That's another occurrence.\nRow 5: games=7, drawn=0. Not relevant.\nRow 6: games=7, drawn=0. Not relevant.\nRow 7: games=7, drawn=0. Not relevant.\n\nSo in total, I found two rows where the team drew (drawn=1) and had a goal difference of either 34-25 or 36-29. The claim says there are three occasions. So does that mean the claim is false because there's only two instances?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. It says \"3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\" Maybe it's saying that in three drawn games, both goal differences occurred at least once? Or perhaps that there are three instances where they drew and had either of those two specific goal differences.\n\nWait no, the wording is a bit unclear. It says \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\" So it's possibly stating that in three separate occasions, the team both drew and had either 34-25 or 36-29 as their goal difference.\n\nIn our table, rows 3 and 4 are the only ones where drawn=1 and they have those specific goal differences. That's two instances. Therefore, there aren't three such occasions in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that a team had three draws and also achieved both of those goal difference numbers (34-25 and 36-29) across those three draws. But looking at row 3 and 4, each has only one of the two goal differences. There's no row where the team drew and had both 34-25 and 36-29.\n\nWait, but each row only reflects a single game or instance. So for each draw, they have their own goal difference. So if you look at all draws in the table (rows where drawn=1), there are two rows that match either 34-25 or 36-29 as their goal difference.\n\nSo the claim says \"3 occasions,\" but we only find two. Therefore, the claim is false because there aren't three such instances.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are three draws with specific goal differences. However, only two rows in the table meet both conditions: drawn=1 and either 34-25 or 36-29 goal difference.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be only 2 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" So, it's asserting that there are exactly two instances where the points column has a value of 7 and the lost column also has a value of 3 for those rows. \n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I'll go through each row to check where both 'points' is 7 and 'lost' is 3.\n\nStarting from row 0: points are 12, so not relevant.\nRow 1: same as row 0, no.\nRow 2: points are 10, moving on.\nRow 3: points are 7. Let's check the lost column here. It says 3. So that's one instance where both points=7 and lost=3.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3 in points and lost, so another one. That makes it two instances so far.\n\nRow 5: points are 6, not relevant.\nRows 6 and 7 have points less than 7, so no.\n\nSo, rows 3 and 4 meet the criteria of having points=7 and lost=3 each time. Therefore, there are exactly two such cases, which matches the claim's assertion.\n\nI don't see any other rows that satisfy both conditions beyond these two. So, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells, I need their row indices and column names. For rows 3 and 4, looking at the 'points' and 'lost' columns.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has several columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, points.\n\nSo for each of these two rows, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0), so rows 3 and 4. Wait no, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the first data row is |7|0|1|51-10|12|. So that's row 0.\n\nThen, the next row with points=7 is the fourth one: games=7, drawn=1, lost=3, goal difference=34-25, points=7. That's row index 3.\n\nThe fifth row also has points=7 and lost=3: same numbers as row 4? Wait no, let me recount:\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 0: games=7, drawn=0, lost=1, goal difference=51-10, points=12\nRow 1: same as row 0?\nNo, wait no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the markdown table seems to have each row as a separate line. So the first data row is:\n\n|       7 |       0 |      1 | 51 - 10           |       12 |\n\nThat's row 0.\n\nThen next row:\n\n|       7 |       0 |      1 | 40 - 13           |       12 |\n\nRow 1.\n\nThird row:\n\n|       7 |       0 |      2 | 41 - 19           |       10 |\n\nRow 2.\n\nFourth row:\n\n|       7 |       1 |      3 | 34 - 25           |        7 |\n\nRow 3: points=7, lost=3.\n\nFifth row:\n\n|       7 |       1 |      3 | 36 - 29           |        7 |\n\nRow 4: same as row 3. So that's another one with points=7 and lost=3.\n\nSixth row:\n\n|       7 |       0 |      4 | 32 - 27           |        6 |\n\nRow5.\n\nSeventh row:\n\n|       7 |       0 |      6 | 17 - 68           |        2 |\n\nRow6.\n\nEighth row:\n\n|       7 |       0 |      7 | 11 - 71           |        0 |\n\nRow7.\n\nSo the two rows where points=7 and lost=3 are rows 3 and 4, which correspond to row indices 3 and 4 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor row 3: columns 'points' (column index 4) and 'lost' (column index2). But in the table, the columns are games, drawn, lost, goal difference, points. So their column names are \"games\", \"drawn\", \"lost\", \"goal difference\", \"points\".\n\nSo for row 3: column_names would be \"points\" and \"lost\".\nSimilarly for row4.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include both of these rows, specifying their row_index and column_name.\n\nSo the JSON object will have:\n\nanswer: \"TRUE\"\n\nrelevant_cells: two entries:\n{\n   \"row_index\": 3,\n   \"column_name\": \"points\"\n},\n{\n   \"row_index\": 4,\n   \"column_name\": \"points\"\n}\n\nWait no, wait. Because each row is a separate entry with multiple columns. So for each of the rows where points=7 and lost=3, we need to include both 'points' and 'lost' columns.\n\nSo for row3 (row_index:3), the relevant columns are 'points' (4th column) and 'lost' (3rd column).\n\nSimilarly, for row4 (row_index:4), same columns.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells list will have four entries:\n\nFor row3:\n{\n   \"row_index\": 3,\n   \"column_name\": \"points\"\n},\n{\n   \"row_index\": 3,\n   \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n}\n\nAnd for row4:\n{\n   \"row_index\": 4,\n   \"column_name\": \"points\"\n},\n{\n   \"row_index\": 4,\n   \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n}\n\nSo the JSON should have all four cells.\n\nWait, but maybe I can list each cell individually. So in total, four relevant_cells: two from row3 and two from row4.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON would include these four entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"when the goal difference be 11 - 71 , the point be 1\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a specific goal difference: 11 - 71. I think this might be a typo because typically, goal difference is calculated as goals for minus goals against, and it's usually represented as a positive or negative number, not as a subtraction expression like \"11 - 71.\" But maybe in this context, they mean the value of the goal difference being 11 minus 71. So I'll take that as given.\n\nThe claim states that when this specific goal difference occurs, the points should be 1. My task is to check the table provided and see if there's any row where the goal difference is \"11 - 71\" and the points column shows a value of 1.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to go through each row and check two columns: \"goal difference\" and \"points.\" \n\nLet me list out the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: goal diff is 51-10 (which equals 41), points are 12\n2. Row 1: goal diff is 40-13 (27), points are 12\n3. Row 2: goal diff is 41-19 (22), points are 10\n4.

Row 7: goal diff is 11-71 (-60), points are 0\n\nWait, in the table, \"goal difference\" seems to be written as two numbers separated by a minus sign, like \"51 - 10\". So for each row, I need to parse that into a numerical value.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nRow 0: 51-10 = 41\nRow 1: 40-13 = 27\nRow 2: 41-19 = 22\nRow 3: 34-25 = 9\nRow 4: 36-29 = 7\nRow 5: 32-27 = 5\nRow 6: 17-68 = -51\nRow 7: 11-71 = -60\n\nSo none of these goal differences match \"11 - 71\" because that would be -60, but looking at the rows, only Row 6 has a negative value of -51 and Row 7 is -60. So in Row 7, the goal difference is indeed 11 - 71 = -60.\n\nNow, let's look at the points column for each row:\n\nRow 0:12\nRow1:12\nRow2:10\nRow3:7\nRow4:7\nRow5:6\nRow6:2\nRow7:0\n\nThe claim says that when the goal difference is 11-71, the points should be 1. But in Row 7, where the goal difference is -60 (which is 11-71), the points are 0, not 1.\n\nTherefore, there's a discrepancy here. The claim is stating that points would be 1 when this specific goal difference occurs, but according to the table, the points are actually 0 in that case.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim is false because the points don't match as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the goal difference is \"11 - 71,\" the points should be 1. However, checking each row:\n\n- Only Row 7 has a goal difference of \"11 - 71\" (-60), with points equal to 0.\n\nThus, the points do not match the claim, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table has several columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. Each row represents a different game with specific data.\n\nThe claim says, \"there be 2 times when the point be greater than 12 and no time when the point be less than 2.\" So I need to check each row's points column to see if it meets these conditions.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'points' column. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Points are 12. That's equal to 12, not greater than. So that doesn't count for the first part.\n\nRow 1: Also 12. Same as above.\n\nRow 2: Points are 10. That's less than 12 and more than 2, but it's not over 12.\n\nRow 3: 7 points. Again, less than 12 and above 2.\n\nRow 4: Also 7. Same as row 3.\n\nRow 5: 6 points. Still between 2 and 12.\n\nRow 6: 2 points. That's exactly the lower bound mentioned in the claim. The claim says \"no time when the point be less than 2,\" which I interpret as points never being below 2, but here it's equal to 2. So does that count? The wording is a bit ambiguous. If \"less than 2\" means strictly below 2, then 2 would be acceptable. But if it includes equal to 2, then this row might violate the claim.\n\nRow 7: 0 points. That's definitely less than 2, which violates the second part of the claim.\n\nSo from this analysis, let's see:\n\n1. Are there two rows where points are greater than 12? Looking at the table, I don't see any points over 12. The highest is 12 in row 0 and 1. So that condition isn't met. There are zero times when points exceed 12.\n\n2. Does any row have points less than 2? Yes, rows 6 (2) and 7 (0). Wait, but the claim says \"no time when the point be less than 2.\" But here, at least two rows (rows 6 and 7) have points below or equal to 2. So that part is violated.\n\nWait, actually, row 6 has 2 points. If the claim is about being \"less than 2,\" then 2 is not less than 2. So maybe only row 7 violates it. That's one instance where points are less than 2 (since 0 < 2). Row 6 is equal to 2, which might be acceptable depending on interpretation.\n\nBut the claim says \"no time when the point be less than 2,\" so as long as there are no points below 2, it's true. However, row 7 has 0 points, which is less than 2. So that violates the claim. Therefore, the overall statement is false because there is a time when points were less than 2.\n\nWait, but I need to check both parts: the claim says two times when points are over 12 and no times under 2. Since neither of those conditions are met (only one row has points equal to 12), the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table's 'points' column never exceeds 12, so there aren't two instances where points are greater than 12. Additionally, row 7 shows points at 0, which is less than 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"when the point be 13 , the goal difference be 51 -10 and 40 -13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table where the points column equals 13. Points are listed as 12, 12, 10, 7, 7, 6, 2, 0. Scanning through these, I notice there's no row with exactly 13 points. The closest is 12 and 10, but not 13. So the condition \"when the point be 13\" might not have any relevant data in the table.\n\nHowever, maybe the claim is trying to say that when points are 13, both 51-10 and 40-13 goal differences exist. But since no row has 13 points, I need to check if there's a misunderstanding or if it's referring to two separate rows where points aren't 13 but their goal differences include those values.\n\nLooking at the table again, let's find rows with specific goal differences. The claim mentions 51-10 and 40-13 as goal differences. \n\nFirst, for 51 - 10: Looking through each row, I see that in the first row, goal difference is 51-10, which equals 41. Points here are 12. So this row has points=12, not 13.\n\nNext, for 40 -13: That's 27. Checking the second row, yes, it shows 40-13 as the goal difference with points=12 again. \n\nSo even though neither of these rows have 13 points, they do show the specified goal differences. The claim might be implying that both goal differences (51-10 and 40-13) exist when points are 13, but since there's no row with 13 points, it's misleading.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is trying to say that for rows where points are 13, those specific goal differences apply. But since there are no such rows, perhaps the claim is incorrect because those goal differences don't occur when points are 13.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that maybe the user made a mistake and meant points=12 instead of 13, then both goal differences would be relevant for points=12. However, the claim specifically says 13, so it's important to check against that.\n\nAnother angle: The table shows two rows with 51-10 (points=12) and 40-13 (points=12). So perhaps the claim is trying to associate these goal differences with a points value of 13, which isn't accurate. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no row where points are 13, but if it's about whether those specific goal differences exist regardless of points, then maybe.\n\nBut looking at the instructions, I need to check if the claim is fully supported by the table. The claim links the point value to both goal differences. Since there's no 13 points, and the two mentioned goal differences occur with different points (12), it seems the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, checking for cells where points=13 and also for those specific goal differences. But since points never reach 13 in the table, there are no relevant rows. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE because the condition of points being 13 isn't met, making the claim unsupported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is asserting that when the points column equals 13, certain goal differences (51-10 and 40-13) exist. However, upon examining the table, there are no rows with a points value of 13. The two specific goal differences mentioned do appear in different rows but with points values of 12. Thus, the claim's condition isn't met, making it incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be 3 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two conditions:\n\n1. There are 3 instances where the points column equals 7.\n2. Each of these instances has a loss count of exactly 3.\n\nSo, I need to check the table and see if any rows meet both these criteria: points = 7 and losses = 3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different scenario with varying numbers of games drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. My task is to scan through each row and check for these two conditions.\n\nLet me start by scanning each row's \"points\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Points =12\n- Row1:12\n- Row2:10\n- Row3:7 \u2192 Now, I need to check the loss column here. Looking at row3's \"lost\" column, it says 3. So this row meets both conditions.\n- Row4:7 again. Checking loss for row4: it's also 3. So that's another one.\n- Moving on, row5 has points=6, so not relevant.\n- Row6: Points=2\n- Row7: Points=0\n\nSo from the points column, only rows 3 and 4 have points equal to 7.\n\nNow, for these two rows, I need to check if their \"lost\" column is exactly 3 each time.\n\nRow3's lost is 3 \u2192 meets condition.\nRow4's lost is also 3 \u2192 meets condition.\n\nSo that gives us two instances where points=7 and losses=3. The claim says there should be three such instances, but the table only has two. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because it states \"3 times\" when in reality only two exist.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a row? Let's go through each row again:\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow0: points=12\nRow1:12\nRow2:10\nRow3:7, lost=3\nRow4:7, lost=3\nRow5:6\nRow6:2\nRow7:0\n\nYes, only two instances where points are 7 and losses are 3. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims there are three such cases.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three rows where points equal 7 and losses equal 3. Upon examining the table, only two rows meet both conditions: row3 and row4.
