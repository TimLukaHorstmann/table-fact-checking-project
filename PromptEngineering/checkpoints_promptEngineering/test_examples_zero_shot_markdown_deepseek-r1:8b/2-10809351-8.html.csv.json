    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"During the 1949 VFL season, prince park venue recorded the highest crowd participation.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check the table for any mention of Prince Park. Looking at the table headers, the venues listed are Kardinia Park, Victoria Park, Princes Park, MCG, Lake Oval, and Western Oval. Wait, there's no Prince Park here. So maybe it's a typo or a different name.\n\nI should consider that \"Prince Park\" might actually be \"Princes Park.\" Let me check the table again. Yes, I see a row where the home team is Carlton versus North Melbourne at Princes Park. The crowd for that game is 29500.\n\nNow, the claim mentions Prince Park having the highest crowd participation in the 1949 VFL season. So I need to verify if Princes Park had the highest attendance among all games listed on that date (4 June 1949).\n\nLooking at each row's crowd numbers:\n- Geelong vs Richmond: 22500\n- Collingwood vs St Kilda: 12000\n- Carlton vs North Melbourne: 29500\n- Melbourne vs Hawthorn: 11000\n- South Melbourne vs Fitzroy: 12500\n- Footscray vs Essendon: 12500\n\nThe highest crowd is indeed 29500 at Princes Park. So the claim, if referring to Princes Park as Prince Park, would be true. Therefore, the relevant cells are the ones for Carlton (home team) and North Melbourne (away team) in the crowd column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each venue's attendance for the 1949 VFL season. The highest attendance was at Princes Park with 29500 spectators. This supports the claim if \"Prince Park\" is a reference to Princes Park.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by reading both the claim and the table carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"melbourne home team have a home score of 10.17 (77) while the south melbourne home team have a home score of 12.7 (79).\" \n\nI need to check if this matches what's in the table provided. Let me look at the table structure. It has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nFirst, I should locate the rows for Melbourne and South Melbourne as they're mentioned in the claim. Looking through the table, I see:\n\n- The first row is about Geelong, so no.\n- Second row is Collingwood vs St Kilda \u2013 not relevant.\n- Third row is Carlton vs North Melbourne \u2013 still no.\n- Fourth row: Melbourne vs Hawthorn. Here, the home team is Melbourne with a score of 10.17 (77).\n- Fifth row: South Melbourne vs Fitzroy. The home team here is South Melbourne with a score of 12.7 (79).\n\nSo, both Melbourne and South Melbourne are home teams in their respective rows. Their scores match exactly what's stated in the claim. There's no discrepancy here.\n\nI should also make sure that it's the correct columns being referenced. The \"home team score\" column is clearly where the scores are listed for each home team. So, yes, those numbers are directly from that column.\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim correctly reference the right teams and their scores as per the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately references the correct scores for both Melbourne and South Melbourne in their respective matches, matching the data provided in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"western oval be 1 of the 2 venue that record a crowd participation of 12500 each.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and \"crowd.\" Since the claim mentions \"western oval\" as one of two venues with 12,500 participants, I need to check how many times this venue had a crowd participation of exactly 12,500.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row lists \"kardinia park\" with a crowd of 22,500.\n2. Second is \"victoria park,\" 12,000.\n3. Third is \"princes park,\" 29,500.\n4. Fourth is \"mcg,\" 11,000.\n5. Fifth is \"lake oval,\" 12,500.\n6. Sixth is \"western oval,\" 12,500.\n\nSo, western oval has a crowd of 12,500, and lake oval also has the same figure. That makes two venues with 12,500 each. Therefore, the claim is true because western oval is one of these two.\n\nI'll check which cells are relevant. The \"crowd\" column for both western oval (row index 6) and lake oval (row index 5).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about Victoria Park being one of the six venues in use on June 4, 1949 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand exactly what the claim is saying. It states that \"victoria park be 1 of the 6 venue that be in use on 4 june 1949.\" So, the key points here are:\n- The venue is Victoria Park.\n- It should be one of six venues used.\n- The date is June 4, 1949.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. Each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, along with details like scores, venue, crowd size, and date. My goal is to check if Victoria Park appears in the 'venue' column for that specific date.\n\nI'll start by examining each row's 'home team', 'away team', 'venue', and 'date' columns to see which matches the criteria.\n\n1. The first match is between Geelong (home) and Richmond (away). Venue is Kardinia Park, date is 4 June 1949.\n2. Next, Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park on 4 June 1949.\n3. Carlton against North Melbourne at Princes Park, also on 4 June 1949.\n4. Melbourne plays Hawthorn at the MCG with a crowd of 11,000 on that date.\n5. South Melbourne faces Fitzroy at Lake Oval, same date.\n6. Finally, Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval, again on 4 June 1949.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Victoria Park is indeed one of the six venues listed for 4 June 1949. It's the second match in the table.\n\nNow, to verify this claim, I need to check the 'venue' column and confirm if Victoria Park appears there along with the correct date. The relevant cells are where the venue is Victoria Park and the date is 4 june 1949.\n\nIn terms of JSON structure, each relevant cell should have a \"row_index\" (which seems to be the index based on their order in the table) and the \"column_name\", which here would be 'venue' since that's the column we're checking against the claim.\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm only including the exact cells that are necessary. Since Victoria Park is listed once, there's one relevant cell. So, the JSON will include an array with a single object indicating row_index 1 (since it's the second entry in the table) and column_name 'venue'.\n\nFinally, since all the conditions of the claim are met\u2014Victoria Park is one of six venues used on that date\u2014the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Victoria Park was one of six venues in use on June 4, 1949, we check the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Geelong vs Richmond at Kardinia Park (not relevant)\n2. **Row 1**: Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park (relevant)\n3. **Row 2**: Carlton vs North Melbourne at Princes Park (not relevant)\n4. **Row 3**: Melbourne vs Hawthorn at MCG (not relevant)\n5. **Row 4**: South Melbourne vs Fitzroy at Lake Oval (not relevant)\n6. **Row 5**: Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval (not relevant)\n\nOnly Row 1's venue is Victoria Park on the specified date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"During the 1949 VFL season, Prince Park venue recorded the lowest crowd participation.\" So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that supports this statement.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. The relevant columns for the claim would be 'venue' and 'crowd'. Since the claim is about Prince Park's crowd participation being the lowest, I need to find the crowd numbers associated with games played at Prince Park.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Geelong vs Richmond: Venue is Kardinia Park.\n2. Collingwood vs St Kilda: Venue is Victoria Park.\n3. Carlton vs North Melbourne: Venue is Princes Park. Hmm, that's the venue we're interested in.\n4. Melbourne vs Hawthorn: Venue is MCG.\n5. South Melbourne vs Fitzroy: Venue is Lake Oval.\n6. Footscray vs Essendon: Venue is Western Oval.\n\nWait, I don't see a row where the venue is Prince Park. So, does that mean there's no match at Prince Park in 1949? Or maybe I missed it? Let me double-check the table.\n\nLooking back, yes, only matches for Kardinia Park, Victoria Park, Princes Park, MCG, Lake Oval, and Western Oval are listed. No mention of Prince Park. So, if there's no match at Prince Park in 1949, then the claim about Prince Park having the lowest crowd participation can't be supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no evidence in the table that Prince Park hosted any matches with the lowest attendance during that season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false as there are no entries for Prince Park in the 1949 VFL season, so no crowd data can support it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the crowd numbers at two venues is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"kardinia park venue have a 10000 crowd participant more than that of the western oval venue.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. There's a markdown table with several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. My focus is on the \"crowd\" column for two specific venues: kardinia park and western oval.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to find where these venues are mentioned and their corresponding crowd numbers.\n\nLooking at the first row, it's about geelong as the home team with a crowd of 22500. The venue is kardinia park, so that's one relevant cell.\n\nNext, the second row is collingwood vs st kilda at victoria park with 12000 attendees\u2014no match for our venues.\n\nThe third row is carlton vs north melbourne at princes park with 29500\u2014again, not our venues.\n\nFourth row: melbourne vs hawthorn at mcg with 11000. Not relevant.\n\nFifth row: south melbourne vs fitzroy at lake oval with 12500. Still not kardinia or western oval.\n\nSixth row: footscray vs essendon at western oval, crowd of 12500. That's the other venue in question.\n\nSo, from the table, kardinia park had a crowd of 22500 and western oval had 12500 on that date.\n\nNow, the claim says kardinia park has more than 10000 attendees. Since 22500 is definitely higher than 10000, this seems true at first glance.\n\nBut wait, I need to check exactly what the claim states: it specifies \"kardinia park venue have a 10000 crowd participant more than that of the western oval venue.\" So it's about kardinia having more than 10,000 attendees compared to western oval.\n\nIn the table, kardinia had 22500 and western oval 12500. Both are above 10,000, but the question is whether kardinia has more than 10k more than western oval. Wait, no\u2014it's just comparing that kardinia's crowd is more than 10k. Since both are over 10k, the claim is true because 22500 > 10000 and 12500 < 10000? No, wait\u2014wait, no: the claim isn't about the difference; it's about whether kardinia's crowd is more than 10,000. Since both are above 10k, but the claim is that kardinia has more than western oval. Wait, no\u2014the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, let me re-read the claim: \"kardinia park venue have a 10000 crowd participant more than that of the western oval venue.\" So it's saying kardinia had at least 10,000 attendees, and western oval less? Or that kardinia has more than 10k compared to western oval.\n\nBut looking at the numbers: both are above 10k. So does the claim hold? It says kardinia park has a 10000 crowd participant more than western oval. Wait, perhaps it's implying that kardinia had over 10k, while western oval didn't. But in reality, both have over 10k.\n\nWait, no\u2014the exact wording is: \"kardinia park venue have a 10000 crowd participant more than that of the western oval venue.\"\n\nSo, does it mean that kardinia's crowd is greater than 10,000? Because 22500 > 10000, yes. But also, is the comparison to western oval necessary? So the claim could be interpreted as stating that kardinia has a crowd of more than 10k compared to western oval.\n\nBut in reality, both have over 10k: 22,500 vs 12,500. So the claim's statement about kardinia having more than 10k is true because 22,500 > 10,000. However, the wording also says \"more than that of\" western oval, which implies a comparison between the two. Since both are above 10k, but kardinia has a larger crowd, so it's not just about being over 10k but more than western oval.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is stating that kardinia park had more than 10,000 attendees, which is true because it was 22,500. It doesn't matter what western oval had; the key point is whether kardinia exceeded 10k. Since both are above 10k, but the claim specifically mentions comparing to western oval, perhaps implying that kardinia's attendance was higher than 10k (which it is) and also higher than western oval's.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the ones for kardinia park and western oval. From the table:\n\n- Kardinia Park: row index 0, crowd column value 22500.\n- Western Oval: row index 5, crowd column value 12500.\n\nSince 22500 > 10000, the claim is true because kardinia had a larger attendance than 10k and also more than western oval's 12.5k.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014does the claim say that kardinia has more than 10k attendees, regardless of western oval? Or does it say that kardinia has more attendees than western oval by more than 10k?\n\nThe wording is a bit unclear, but I think it's stating that kardinia park had a crowd of at least 10,000, which is true. It might also imply that this number is higher than western oval's, but in any case, both are above 10k.\n\nSo, to check the claim: Does kardinia have more than 10k attendees? Yes. So the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the crowd figures for Kardinia Park and Western Oval from the table. Both venues had more than 10,000 attendees, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"melbourne home team have a home score of 14.13 (97) while the south melbourne home team have a home score of 12.7 (79).\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and identify which rows and columns are relevant. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nThe first part of the claim is about the Melbourne home team having a home score of 14.13 (97). So I'm looking for the row where the home team is Melbourne and the column for the home score. Looking at the table, there's only one row for Melbourne. It's the fifth row: \"melbourne\" as the home team with a home score of 10.17 (77). Hmm, that's not matching the claim. The claim says 14.13 (97), but in the table, it's 10.17 (77). So that part doesn't seem to match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The fifth row is melbourne with home score 10.17 (77). So yes, it's not matching the claim. So there's an issue here already.\n\nThe second part of the claim is about the South Melbourne home team having a home score of 12.7 (79). Looking for the South Melbourne row, I see that it's actually the sixth row: \"south melbourne\" as the home team with a home score of 12.7 (79). That does match the claim.\n\nSo, putting this together, the first part of the claim is false because Melbourne's score in the table doesn't match what's stated. The second part is true. But since one part is wrong, the entire claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if there are multiple instances of Melbourne or South Melbourne. No, each team appears only once in this table on 4 June 1949. So only one game per team.\n\nTherefore, the claim has an error because it incorrectly states Melbourne's score as 14.13 (97) when the actual score is 10.17 (77).

The columns related are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and importantly, \"crowd\" for each game. Each row represents a match between two teams on a specific date.\n\nI should locate both Kardinia Park and Lake Oval in the table. Scanning through the 'venue' column:\n\n- Kardinia Park is associated with Geelong's home game against Richmond.\n- Lake Oval is linked to South Melbourne's game against Fitzroy.\n\nNow, I need to extract their respective crowd numbers from the 'crowd' column. From the table:\n\n- Kardinia Park had a crowd of 22,500.\n- Lake Oval had a crowd of 12,500.\n\nWait, the claim says that Kardinia Park had 10,000 more attendees than Lake Oval. So, let's calculate the difference: 22,500 - 12,500 equals 10,000. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nBut hold on, I should double-check to ensure there are no other entries for these venues.

The claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the crowd numbers from the table, confirming that Kardinia Park had a larger attendance than Lake Oval.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"western oval be 1 of the 2 venue that record a crowd participation of 11000 each.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim to understand what it's saying. It mentions two venues where the crowd participation was exactly 11,000 each. So, I need to check if Western Oval is one of these two and whether there's another venue with the same number.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, along with details like venue, crowd size, and date. My focus here is on the \"crowd\" column because the claim mentions the crowd participation numbers.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Geelong vs Richmond**: The crowd is 22,500.\n2. **Collingwood vs St Kilda**: Crowd is 12,000.\n3. **Carlton vs North Melbourne**: Crowd is 29,500.\n4. **Melbourne vs Hawthorn**: Crowd is 11,000.\n5. **South Melbourne vs Fitzroy**: Crowd is 12,500.\n6. **Footscray vs Essendon**: Crowd is 12,500.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Western Oval isn't directly listed as a venue in the \"venue\" column. Wait, no\u2014the claim doesn't mention the venues but focuses on crowd numbers. So perhaps the issue is whether Western Oval is one of the two with 11,000.\n\nWait, looking again at the table, the fourth row has the venue as McG and the crowd as 11,000. So Melbourne vs Hawthorn took place at McG with 11,000 people. That's one venue with 11,000.\n\nNow, does Western Oval have a crowd of 11,000? Looking through each row:\n\n- The fifth row is South Melbourne vs Fitzroy at Lake Oval, crowd 12,500.\n- The sixth row is Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval, but the crowd is listed as 12,500. So no, Western Oval's crowd isn't 11,000; it's 12,500.\n\nWait, that contradicts my initial thought. Maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 0: geelong, 22,500\n- Row 1: collingwood, 12,000\n- Row 2: carlton, 29,500\n- Row 3: melbourne, 11,000\n- Row 4: south melbourne, 12,500\n- Row 5: footscray, 12,500\n\nSo only the fourth row has a crowd of exactly 11,000. Western Oval is mentioned in row 5 as the venue, but the crowd there was 12,500, not 11,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that Western Oval is one of two venues with 11,000 each. But from the table, only McG has 11,000, and Western Oval has 12,500. So the claim isn't accurate because Western Oval's crowd wasn't 11,000. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in looking at the venues. Let me check again: row 3 is melbourne vs hawthorn at McG, crowd 11k. Row 5 is footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval, crowd 12,500. So only one venue has 11k. The claim says there are two, so it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Western Oval and another venue each had a crowd of 11,000. However, upon reviewing the table, only McG had an 11,000 attendance, while Western Oval recorded 12,500. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
