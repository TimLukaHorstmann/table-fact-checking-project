    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"pontyclun rfc have more point than cilfynydd rfc for the 20 game they play.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to data in the table. The key elements are \"pontyclun rfc,\" \"cilfynydd rfc,\" \"points,\" and that it's based on 20 games each.\n\nLooking at the table headers, there's a column named \"points.\" So that's what I need to check for both clubs. Also, I should make sure that each has played 20 games. From the table, it seems like all the clubs have played 20 matches since their 'played' cell is 20 for every row.\n\nSo, the relevant columns are definitely \"points\" for both pontyclun rfc and cilfynydd rfc. I should find where each of these clubs is in the table to get their respective points.\n\nLooking through the rows, pontyclun rfc is first with 86 points. Then, moving down, cilfynydd rfc is the next row with 74 points. Since 86 is greater than 74, this means that according to the table, pontyclun rfc has more points than cilfynydd rfc.\n\nI should also confirm the other parts of the claim to ensure there's no trick here. The claim mentions they both played 20 games, which they did. There's no part about tries or bonuses needed because the claim is specifically about points, so I don't need to consider other columns like \"tries for\" or \"losing bonus.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the \"points\" column for both clubs. Pontyclun rfc has 86 points, while cilfynydd rfc has 74.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions two clubs: Canton RFC and Dinas Powys RFC.\n\nI'll locate their respective rows in the table. Canton RFC is at row index 9, and Dinas Powys RFC is at row index 10.\n\nNext, I need to check how many games each club lost. For Canton RFC, under the 'lost' column, it's 18. For Dinas Powys RFC, the 'lost' column shows 17.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the difference in the number of losses. Canton RFC lost 18 games, and Dinas Powys RFC lost 17.

The claim says that Pontyclun RFC and Barry RFC have an average of 1 drawn during their 20-game season. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Since there are two clubs mentioned in the claim, I should focus on their respective rows. So, I'll find Pontyclun RFC and Barry RFC in the table.\n\nLooking for Pontyclun RFC, I see it's the first row after the headers. The number of drawn games is 0. Then, for Barry RFC, it's the third row with 2 drawn games.\n\nNow, since each team has played 20 games, the average would be the total number of draws divided by 20. For Pontyclun, that's 0/20, which is 0. For Barry, it's 2/20, which equals 0.1.\n\nThe claim says their average is 1 drawn per game on average, but both teams have averages much lower than that\u20140 and 0.1 respectively.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that for the total 20 games these teams play, Canton RFC achieves the lowest points. Let me look at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where Canton RFC is in the table. Scanning through each row, I see a row labeled \"canton rfc\" towards the bottom. So, their data is there. Now, I need to find their total points across 20 games.\n\nLooking at the columns, the last column is labeled \"points,\" so that's what we're interested in for Canton RFC. Their points are listed as 10. Now, I have to check if this is indeed the lowest among all teams.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the points:\n\n- Pontyclun RFC: 86\n- Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n- Barry RFC: 63\n- St Albans RFC: 55\n- Deri RFC: 52\n- Hirwaun RFC: 51\n- Penygraig RFC: 43\n- Cowbridge RFC: 37\n- Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n- Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n- Canton RFC: 10\n\nWait, hold on. The lowest points would be the smallest number here. Looking at all the points, I see that the points go from 86 down to 10. So, the smallest is 10 by Canton RFC. But I notice another team, Dinas Powys RFC, has 19 points, which is higher than 10 but lower than many others.\n\nWait, no, wait. The table shows Canton RFC at 10 and Dinas Powys at 19. So 10 is indeed the lowest in the entire table. Therefore, the claim that Canton RFC achieves the lowest points across 20 games would be true.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no other teams with lower points than 10. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through each row's \"points\" column:\n\n- 86,74,63,55,52,51,43,37,33,19,10.\n\nYes, all the points are above 10 except for Canton RFC.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"for the total 20 games these teams play, Penygraig RFC have the lowest losing bonus.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what a losing bonus means in this context. Looking at the table, there are several columns: club name, played, drawn, lost, points for, points against, tries for, tries against, try bonus, losing bonus, and points. The losing bonus seems to be an additional points team gets when they lose a game.\n\nSo, the claim is about Penygraig RFC having the lowest losing bonus out of all the teams in the table. To verify this, I need to check each row for the 'losing bonus' column and see which team has the smallest value there.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. pontyclun rfc: 2\n2. cilfynydd rfc: 2\n3. barry rfc: 2\n4. st albans rfc: 4\n5. deri rfc: 3\n6. hirwaun rfc: 2\n7. penygraig rfc: 1\n8. cowbridge rfc: 4\n9. old penarthians rfc: 3\n10. dinas powys rfc: 3\n11. canton rfc: 1\n\nSo, the losing bonuses range from 1 to 4. The lowest is 1, which is shared by Penygraig RFC and Cant\u00f3n RFC.\n\nWait, so both have a losing bonus of 1. But the claim specifically mentions Penygraig RFC having the lowest. So, technically, there's another team with the same lowest value. Does that mean the claim isn't fully accurate? Because \"lowest\" implies being the only one with that value or at least having the smallest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check the losing bonus for each team:\n\n- Penygraig RFC: 1\n- Cant\u00f3n RFC: 1\n\nSo both have a losing bonus of 1. Therefore, Penygraig isn't unique in having the lowest. Thus, the claim is not fully supported because there's another team with the same value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the 'losing bonus' column is only applicable when they lose, so maybe it's a different calculation. But looking at the table, the losing bonus seems to be an attribute of each team regardless of their performance.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Losing bonus should be based on how many times they lost and perhaps how many points they get from those losses. But according to the column names, 'losing bonus' is a separate value for each team.\n\nTherefore, since both Penygraig and Cant\u00f3n have a losing bonus of 1, which is the lowest among all, but it's not unique. So the claim says \"lowest,\" but there are two teams with that value. Therefore, the claim isn't fully accurate because there's another team (Cant\u00f3n) with the same losing bonus.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in checking the losing bonuses. Let me go through each row again:\n\n1. pontyclun rfc: 2\n2. cilfynydd rfc: 2\n3. barry rfc: 2\n4. st albans rfc: 4\n5. deri rfc: 3\n6. hirwaun rfc: 2\n7. penygraig rfc: 1\n8. cowbridge rfc: 4\n9. old penarthians rfc: 3\n10. dinas powys rfc: 3\n11. canton rfc: 1\n\nYes, both Penygraig and Cant\u00f3n have losing bonus of 1, which is the smallest. So the claim that Penygraig has the lowest is technically true because they do have one of the lowest values, but not necessarily the only one. However, sometimes in such contexts, the term \"lowest\" can mean the minimum value regardless of uniqueness. But if the claim says \"the lowest,\" it might imply they are the sole team with that value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing bonus is calculated as points from losses, so maybe I'm misunderstanding how it's calculated. Let me think: usually, in rugby, a losing bonus is given for each loss, but I'm not sure if it's per game or total. But according to the table, 'losing bonus' seems to be a direct value assigned per team, so it's just a number without further breakdown.\n\nSo, based on that, both Penygraig and Cant\u00f3n have losing bonus of 1, which is the lowest. Therefore, the claim is only partially true because there's another team with the same value. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Penygraig RFC has the lowest losing bonus among all teams in the table. However, upon examining the 'losing bonus' column, both Penygraig RFC and Cant\u00f3n RFC have a losing bonus of 1, which is the smallest value. Since there are two teams with this value, Penygraig isn't unique in having the lowest losing bonus. Therefore, the claim is not fully accurate.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"losing bonus\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"losing bonus\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"cilfynydd rfc have the most point through 20 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it says that cilfynydd RFC has the most points after 20 games. So, my main focus should be on the 'points' column for this club.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different club and their performance in 20 games. The relevant column here is \"points\". I'll need to find the value for cilfynydd RFC under the points column.\n\nI notice that the first row is the header, so the data starts from row index 1. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: pontyclun rfc has 86 points.\nRow 2: cilfynydd rfc has 74 points.\nRow 3: barry rfc has 63 points.\nRow 4: st albans rfc has 55 points.\nRow 5: deri rfc has 52 points.\nRow 6: hirwaun rfc has 51 points.\nRow 7: penygraig rfc has 43 points.\nRow 8: cowbridge rfc has 37 points.\nRow 9: old penarthians rfc has 33 points.\nRow 10: dinas powys rfc has 19 points.\nRow 11: canton rfc has 10 points.\n\nNow, comparing these values, the highest points among all clubs is 86 from pontyclun RFC. Cilfynydd RFC only has 74, which is lower than that.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"canton rfc lost all 20 games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has several columns: club name, played, drawn, lost, points for, points against, tries for, tries against, try bonus, losing bonus, and points. Each row represents a different club's performance over 20 games.\n\nThe claim in question is about Canton RFC. It says they lost all 20 games. So I need to check the 'lost' column for Canton RFC in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific club. For example, the second row is cilfynydd rfc with played=20, drawn=1, lost=4, etc. Similarly, Canton RFC's row is the last one in the table, which is labeled as 'canton rfc'.\n\nIn that row, I see:\n- Played: 20\n- Drawn: 0\n- Lost: 18\n\nSo, according to this data, Canton RFC lost 18 out of their 20 games. That means they did not lose all 20 games; they actually have 18 losses and 2 draws (since played=20, drawn=0, so lost=20 - 0 = 20, but wait, that doesn't add up).\n\nWait, no, the sum should be played + drawn + lost. For Canton RFC: played is 20, drawn is 0, lost is 18. So total games are 20 + 0 + 18 = 38? That can't be right because each match is a game, so it's impossible for a team to have more than one result per game. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table.\n\nWait, no, in rugby league or union, each game is between two teams, and each game contributes to the results of both teams involved. So each row in the table represents one club's performance across all their games.\n\nLooking back, for Canton RFC: played=20, drawn=0, lost=18. That would mean they have 20 games, 0 draws, and 18 losses, which sums up to 38? That doesn't make sense because each game is a single entity. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table.\n\nWait, maybe 'played' refers to the number of games played as home or away, but that's not how it works. Each game contributes one win, one loss, or one draw for both teams. So in reality, if a club has 20 games, they can't have more than 20 results. So having played=20, drawn=0, lost=18 would imply 38 total games, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me check other rows to see if this makes sense. For example, Dinas Powys RFC has played=20, drawn=0, lost=17. That's 37 total results, which also doesn't make sense because each game should result in one entry for two teams.\n\nThis seems odd. Perhaps the 'played' column refers to something else, or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps each team plays all other teams once, but that would vary depending on how many clubs there are.\n\nBut regardless of that confusion, the key point is the specific claim about Canton RFC losing all 20 games. According to their row in the table, they have lost 18 games and drawn none, meaning they didn't lose all 20 games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because they only lost 18 out of 20.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. If a team plays 20 games, how can they have lost 18? That would mean they lost 18, drew 0, so played 20: 18 + 0 = 18, which leaves 2 unaccounted for. This might indicate an error in the table, but regardless, according to the data provided, Canton RFC did not lose all 20 games; they only lost 18.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"canton rfc lost all 20 game\" is FALSE because, based on the table, Canton RFC only lost 18 of their 20 games. \n\nTo verify this:\n- Locate the row for Canton RFC.\n- Check the 'lost' column, which shows 18.\n\nSince they did not lose all 20 games, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Barry RFC is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Barry RFC be the only team with more than 1 game drawn through 20 games.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of the claim means. The key points here are that we're looking for teams that have drawn more than 1 game out of their total 20 games played. Also, it's important whether Barry RFC is the only team with this characteristic.\n\nI'll start by examining the 'drawn' column in the table because the claim is about the number of draws each team has. The 'drawn' column shows how many games each club has drawn. \n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Pontyclun RFC: 0 drawn\n- Cilfynydd RFC: 1 drawn\n- Barry RFC: 2 drawn\n- St Albans RFC: 0 drawn\n- Deri RFC: 0 drawn\n- Hirwaun RFC: 1 drawn\n- Penygraig RFC: 1 drawn\n- Cowbridge RFC: 1 drawn\n- Old Penarthians RFC: 0 drawn\n- Dinas Powys RFC: 0 drawn\n- Canton RFC: 0 drawn\n\nNow, I need to check which teams have more than 1 drawn game. Looking at each team's 'drawn' count:\n\n- Pontyclun RFC has 0, so no.\n- Cilfynydd RFC has 1, which is not more than 1.\n- Barry RFC has 2, which is more than 1.\n- St Albans, Deri, Hirwaun, Penygraig, Cowbridge, Old Penarthians, Dinas Powys, and Canton all have 0 or 1 drawn games.\n\nSo, only Barry RFC meets the condition of having more than 1 game drawn (specifically 2). Now, I need to see if this makes them \"the only team\" with such a record. \n\nLooking through all other teams again, none have 2 or more draws. The next highest is Cilfynydd RFC with 1 draw. Therefore, Barry RFC is indeed the only one with more than 1 drawn game.\n\nSo, the claim should be TRUE because Barry is the sole team with over 1 drawn game out of their 20.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"canton rfc gain the fourth - least point through 20 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means.\n\nThe claim says that Canton RFC has the fourth-least points after playing 20 games. So, first, I should find Canton's points in the table. Looking at the table, there are multiple clubs listed. The last club is \"canton rfc\" with a points value of 10. \n\nNext, I need to list all the points each club has and then rank them from least to most. Let me go through each row:\n\n- pontyclun rfc: 86\n- cilfynydd rfc: 74\n- barry rfc: 63\n- st albans rfc: 55\n- deri rfc: 52\n- hirwaun rfc: 51\n- penygraig rfc: 43\n- cowbridge rfc: 37\n- old penarthians rfc: 33\n- dinas powys rfc: 19\n- canton rfc: 10\n\nNow, arranging these points from least to most:\n\n1. dinas powys rfc - 19\n2. old penarthians rfc - 33\n3. cowbridge rfc - 37\n4. penygraig rfc - 43\n5. hirwaun rfc - 51\n6. deri rfc - 52\n7. st albans rfc - 55\n8. barry rfc - 63\n9. cilfynydd rfc - 74\n10. pontyclun rfc - 86\n\nWait, but the claim says Canton is fourth-least. So that would mean they are in position 4 when ordered from least to most. Looking at my list, the fourth club is penygraig with 43 points. However, Canton has 10 points, which is actually higher than several clubs like old penarthians (33), cowbridge (37), and others. So I must have messed up.\n\nWait no, perhaps I need to rank from least to most. So starting from the lowest:\n\n- dinas powys rfc:19\n- old penarthians:33\n- cowbridge:37\n- then next would be canton at 10? No, that doesn't make sense because 10 is less than 33 but higher than 19. Wait no, wait. The points for each club are:\n\ncanton rfc:10\n\nThen deri:52, hirwaun:51, etc. So actually, the lowest is dinas powys with 19, then old penarthians at 33, then cowbridge at37, then next would be... wait, no, because canton has 10, which is lower than all except dinas and old pen.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a list in order from lowest to highest:\n\n1. dinas powys rfc -19\n2. canton rfc -10\n3. old penarthians rfc -33\n4. cowbridge rfc -37\n5. penygraig rfc -43\n6. hirwaun rfc -51\n7. deri rfc -52\n8. st albans rfc -55\n9. barry rfc -63\n10. cilfynydd rfc -74\n11. pontyclun rfc -86\n\nWait, that can't be right because 10 is less than 33 and 19. So actually, the correct order would have canton higher than some but lower than others. Let me list them properly:\n\nThe lowest points are dinas powys with 19.\n\nThen old penarthians at 33, cowbridge at37, then come the rest starting from st albans rfc at55? No, wait, that's not correct because there are clubs like barry, cilfynydd, etc., which have higher points than some but lower than others.\n\nWait no, I think I'm overcomplicating. The key is that Canton has 10 points, and we need to see if they are in the fourth position from the bottom. So let's list all clubs with their points:\n\n- dinas powys:19 (lowest)\n- old penarthians:33\n- cowbridge:37\n- st albans:55\n- deri:52\n- hirwaun:51\n- penygraig:43\n- barry:63\n- cilfynydd:74\n- pontyclun:86\n\nWait, no. That's not correct because the points are:\n\ncanton rfc:10 (lowest)\nold penarthians:33\ncowbridge:37\nthen deri:52? No, wait, deri has 52 which is higher than hirwaun's51.\n\nSo let me list them all in order from lowest to highest points:\n\n1. canton rfc -10\n2. dinas powys rfc -19\n3. old penarthians rfc -33\n4. cowbridge rfc -37\n5. penygraig rfc -43\n6. hirwaun rfc -51\n7. deri rfc -52\n8. st albans rfc -55\n9. barry rfc -63\n10. cilfynydd rfc -74\n11. pontyclun rfc -86\n\nWait, but that can't be because 10 is less than 19 and 33. So actually, the correct order should start with dinas powys at19 as the lowest, then old penarthians 33, cowbridge37, then comes hirwaun51, deri52, st albans55, barry63, cilfynydd74, and finally pontyclun86.\n\nBut where does canton fit in? Cantons' points are10, which is lower than all except dinas powys (19). So actually, the order should be:\n\n1. canton rfc -10\n2. dinas powys rfc -19\n3. old penarthians rfc -33\n4. cowbridge rfc -37\n5. penygraig rfc -43\n6. hirwaun rfc -51\n7. deri rfc -52\n8. st albans rfc -55\n9. barry rfc -63\n10. cilfynydd rfc -74\n11. pontyclun rfc -86\n\nYes, that makes sense. So canton is first with the lowest points at10, then dinas powys second with19, old pen third with33, cowbridge fourth with37, etc.\n\nSo the claim says \"fourth-least\", meaning they are in position4 when ordered from least to most. But according to my list, position1 is canton, 2 is dinas,3 old pen,4 cowbridge.\n\nBut wait, that's if we count them starting at1. So if someone is fourth-least, they have the fourth highest points but worst to first being the lowest.\n\nWait, no. \"fourth-least\" probably means fourth from the bottom, i.e., the fourth lowest score.\n\nSo in the list above:\n\n1. canton -10 (lowest)\n2. dinas -19\n3. old pen -33\n4. cowbridge -37\n\nSo yes, cowbridge is fourth-least with37 points, not canton.\n\nBut the claim says \"Canton is fourth-least\", which would mean their 10 points are in position4 from the bottom, but that's not correct because they are actually first.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. Canton has the lowest points at10, so they should be ranked1st least, not4th.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think my initial assumption was wrong. The points for each club:\n\nLooking back: \n\nThe user's task says \"Canton is fourth-least\", meaning in their league table, Canton is in the fourth position from the bottom when ordered by points.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\ncanton rfc:10\n\nThen dinas powys:19\n\nold penarthians:33\n\ncowbridge:37\n\npenygraig:43\n\nhirwaun:51\n\nderi:52\n\nst albans:55\n\nbarry:63\n\ncilfynydd:74\n\npontyclun:86\n\nSo arranging from lowest (most negative) to highest:\n\n1. canton rfc -10\n\n2. dinas powys rfc -19\n\n3. old penarthians rfc -33\n\n4. cowbridge rfc -37\n\n5. penygraig rfc -43\n\n6. hirwaun rfc -51\n\n7. deri rfc -52\n\n8. st albans rfc -55\n\n9. barry rfc -63\n\n10. cilfynydd rfc -74\n\n11. pontyclun rfc -86\n\nSo in this list, canton is first, dinas second, old pen third, cowbridge fourth.\n\nThus, Canton is not fourth-least; cowbridge is fourth-least.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Canton is fourth-least\" is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in points. Let me check again:\n\nThe user said:\n\n- dinas powys rfc:19\n\n- old penarthians rfc:33\n\n- cowbridge rfc:37\n\n- st albans rfc:55\n\n- barry rfc:63\n\n- cilfynydd rfc:74\n\n- pontyclun rfc:86\n\nBut where are the other clubs? Wait, in the list I made earlier, including all 11 teams.\n\nWait, no. The user probably provided points for some of them, but maybe not all. Let me see.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Dinas Powys RFC:19\n\nOld Penarthians RFC:33\n\nCowbridge RFC:37\n\nSt Albans RFC:55\n\nBarry RFC:63\n\nCilfynydd RFC:74\n\nPontyclun RFC:86\"\n\nSo that's seven teams. But what about the other four? hirwaun, deri, penygraig, canton.\n\nhirwaun rfc:51\n\nderi rfc:52\n\npenygraig rfc:43\n\ncanton rfc:10\n\nSo adding these four, we have 11 teams in total.\n\nThus, the correct order from least to most points is:\n\n1. canton rfc -10\n\n2. dinas powys rfc -19\n\n3. old penarthians rfc -33\n\n4. cowbridge rfc -37\n\n5. penygraig rfc -43\n\n6. hirwaun rfc -51\n\n7. deri rfc -52\n\n8. st albans rfc -55\n\n9. barry rfc -63\n\n10. cilfynydd rfc -74\n\n11. pontyclun rfc -86\n\nSo in this order, Canton is first, Dinas second, Old Pen third, Cowbridge fourth.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Canton is fourth-least\" is wrong because they are actually the least (first). The correct fourth-least is Cowbridge with37 points.\n\nThus, the user's statement is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Canton RFC is fourth-least is incorrect. Based on the provided data:\n\n1. **Canton RFC**: 10 points (lowest)\n2. **Dinas Powys RFC**: 19 points\n3. **Old Penarthians RFC**: 33 points\n4. **Cowbridge RFC**: 37 points (fourth-least)\n\nTherefore, Canton RFC is actually the least, not fourth.",
