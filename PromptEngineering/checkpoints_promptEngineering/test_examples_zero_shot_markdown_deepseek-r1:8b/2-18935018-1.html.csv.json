The claim says, \"there be 2 school who have a location of greensburg.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table's columns to understand what information I'm dealing with. The relevant column here is \"location\" because the claim is about where the schools are located.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row and check the \"location\" cell to see how many schools are in Greensburg. Let me list out the locations:\n\n1. eastern hancock - charlottesville\n2. indian creek - trafalgar\n3. knightstown - knightstown\n4. milan - milan\n5. north decatur - greensburg\n6. south decatur - greensburg\n\nFrom this, I can see that two schools are located in Greensburg: north decatur and south decatur. That's exactly the number the claim is talking about.\n\nI should also note down which rows these are so that I can provide the relevant cells. North Decatur is row 5 (if we start counting from 0, it's index 5), and South Decatur is row 6 (index 6).\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because there are exactly two schools in Greensburg.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"there be more school whose primary conference be mid - hoosier , than any other conference.\" So, it's stating that there are more schools in the 'mid - hoosier' primary conference than any other conference listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several columns relevant to this claim. The key column here is \"primary conference,\" as it directly relates to the conferences each school is part of. The claim specifically refers to 'mid - hoosier,' so I need to count how many schools have this as their primary conference.\n\nLet me go through each row and note down the primary conference:\n\n1. Eastern Hancock: mid - hoosier\n2. Indian Creek: mid - hoosier\n3. Knightstown: mid - hoosier\n4. Milan: ohio river valley\n5. North Decatur: mid - hoosier\n6. South Decatur: mid - hoosier\n\nSo, counting them up, I see Eastern Hancock (1), Indian Creek (2), Knightstown (3), North Decatur (4), and South Decatur (5) all have 'mid - hoosier' as their primary conference. That makes five schools.\n\nNow, checking the other conferences: Milan is part of 'ohio river valley.' There are no other conferences listed in the table besides 'mid - hoosier' and 'ohio river valley.' Since there's only one school in 'ohio river valley,' it can't have more than five. \n\nSo, comparing the two conferences:\n- mid - hoosier: 5 schools\n- ohio river valley: 1 school\n\nSince 5 is greater than 1, the claim holds true.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The primary conference is in the \"primary conference\" column, so each row where the primary conference is 'mid - hoosier' should be included. Looking at the table, rows 0,1,2,4,5 have that value. But wait, let me double-check:\n\n- Row 0: mid - hoosier \u2192 yes\n- Row 1: mid - hoosier \u2192 yes\n- Row 2: mid - hoosier \u2192 yes\n- Row 3: ohio river valley \u2192 no\n- Row 4: mid - hoosier \u2192 yes\n- Row 5: mid - hoosier \u2192 yes\n\nWait, that's rows 0,1,2,4,5. So five rows in total.\n\nBut in the table, each row has a unique index starting from 0 up to 5. So the relevant cells are at indices 0,1,2,4,5 and their column is \"primary conference.\"\n\nSo, I'll list those as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are more schools in the 'mid - hoosier' primary conference than any other. From the table, five schools belong to this conference, while only one school is part of another. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is: \"north decatur do not have ohio river valley as their primary conference.\" \n\nFirst, I should find where \"north decatur\" is in the table. Looking at the first column, school names are listed as:\n\n1. eastern hancock\n2. indian creek\n3. knightstown\n4. milan\n5. north decatur\n6. south decatur\n\nSo north decatur is row index 5.\n\nNow, I need to look for their primary conference. The last column is \"primary conference.\" For row 5, the primary conference is listed as \"ohio river valley.\"\n\nWait, but the claim says that north decatur do not have ohio river valley as their primary conference. However, according to the table, they do have it. That would mean the claim is false.\n\nBut let me double-check the table. In row 5 (north decatur), the primary conference is indeed \"ohio river valley.\" So the statement in the claim is incorrect because north decatur does have that conference.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant.

It's stating that among all the schools listed, Indian Creek has the highest enrollment. So my task is to look at the table and verify if this is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. The key column here is \"enrollment,\" so that's what I should focus on for comparing the schools.\n\nI'll list out the enrollment numbers for each school to make it easier:\n\n1. Eastern Hancock: 348\n2. Indian Creek: 598\n3. Knightstown: 397\n4. Milan: 417\n5. North Decatur: 397\n6. South Decatur: 316\n\nNow, I'll compare these numbers. The highest enrollment is 598, which is for Indian Creek. So that seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each school one by one:\n\n- Eastern Hancock has 348 students.\n- Indian Creek has 598, which is higher than all others.\n- Knightstown and North Decatur both have 397, which is less than 598.\n- Milan has 417, still below 598.\n- South Decatur has 316, the lowest.\n\nSo yes, Indian Creek does have the highest enrollment. \n\nI also need to consider if there's any possibility that another school could tie or surpass this number. Looking at the list again, none of them reach 598. The next closest is Knightstown and North Decatur with 397 each, which is significantly lower.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Indian Creek has the highest enrollment. From the table, Indian Creek indeed has the highest enrollment number (598) compared to all other listed schools. \n\n**Answer: TRUE**\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For \"Indian Creek,\" locate the row with the highest enrollment.

The claim says, \"north decatur have an enrollment that be 81 student higher than south decatur.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate both north decatur and south decatur in the table. Looking at the 'school' column, I see two entries: one for north decatur with a location of greensburg and another for south decatur also located in greensburg. So both are from the same county but different rows.\n\nNext, I need to find their enrollments. North Decatur has an enrollment of 397 students, and South Decatur has 316. The claim is about north Decatur being 81 students higher than south Decatur. Let me check that calculation. \n\nSo, if I subtract the enrollment numbers: 397 (north) minus 316 (south). That gives me 81. So yes, north Decatur's enrollment is exactly 81 more than south Decatur's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other relevant information. The claim only mentions enrollment, so I don't need to check other columns like location or mascot. \n\nI should also confirm that the rows are correctly identified. North Decatur is at row index 5 and South Decatur is at row index 6 in the table provided. So the relevant cells for this comparison would be the 'enrollment' column for both of these schools.\n\nPutting it all together, since north Decatur's enrollment is indeed 81 higher than south Decatur's, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because north decatur's enrollment is exactly 81 students higher than south decatur's.

First, I'll look at the table structure and see what information is provided.\n\nThe table has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. The claim mentions \"indian creek\" and refers to being one of three schools in greensburg. So I should focus on the 'school' column for indian creek and see if there are other schools listed with the same location as greensburg.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row's location column:\n\n1. eastern hancock - charlottesville\n2. indian creek - trafalgar\n3. knightstown - knightstown\n4. milan - milan\n5. north decatur - greensburg\n6. south decatur - greensburg\n\nSo, the two schools in greensburg are north decatur and south decatur. The claim says \"indian creek be 1 of 3,\" but according to the table, only two schools are listed for greensburg. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there aren't three schools mentioned as being in greensburg. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The 'location' column for north decatur and south decatur is greensburg, so that's two schools. Indian Creek is in trafalgar, not greensburg. So the claim is definitely FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key columns here are 'school' and 'location'. For indian creek (row index 1), the 'location' column is trafalgar. Since we're checking if it's in greensburg, that cell is relevant because it shows the location of indian creek isn't greensburg.\n\nAlso, for the schools in greensburg, their rows are 4 and 5. So I need to include those cells as well because they show which schools are in greensburg, confirming there aren't three.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- The 'location' cell of indian creek (row 1).\n- The 'school' cells for north decatur (row 4) and south decatur (row 5).\n\nThat should cover all the necessary information to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that every single school listed in the table has their primary conference set as \"mid - hoosier\". So I need to check each row and see if the primary conference column matches this.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six schools:\n\n1. Eastern Hancock - primary conference is mid - hoosier.\n2. Indian Creek - same here.\n3. Knightstown - also mid - hoosier.\n4. Milan - wait, its primary conference is ohio river valley.\n5. North Decatur - mid - hoosier.\n6. South Decatur - mid - hoosier.\n\nSo out of the six schools, four have mid - hoosier as their primary conference and one (Milan) does not. That means the claim that all of them are mid - hoosier is incorrect. \n\nNow, to map this out, I should check each row's primary conference column.

Looking at the 'school' column: there's eastern hancock, indian creek, knightstown, milan, north decatur, and south decatur. So, that's six schools in total.\n\nThe claim is specifically about indian creek having the least enrollment among all these schools. To verify this, I need to look at the 'enrollment' column for each school and find out which one has the lowest number.\n\nLooking at the 'enrollment' numbers:\n- eastern hancock: 348\n- indian creek: 598\n- knightstown: 397\n- milan: 417\n- north decatur: 397\n- south decatur: 316\n\nNow, let's list these out to find the minimum. The smallest number here is 316, which is for south decatur. Indian Creek has an enrollment of 598, which is much higher than that.\n\nWait, so if the claim is that indian creek has the least enrollment, but their actual enrollment is one of the highest, then the claim must be false. However, I should double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything.\n\nLet me go through each row again:\n1. eastern hancock: 348\n2. indian creek: 598\n3. knightstown: 397\n4. milan: 417\n5. north decatur: 397\n6. south decatur: 316\n\nYes, south decatur is the lowest at 316, followed by knightstown and north decatur at 397, then milan at 417, eastern hancock at 348, and indian creek at 598. So, definitely, south decatur has the least enrollment, not indian creek.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the data shows that indian creek's enrollment is higher than all other schools listed in the table. Wait, but the table only includes these six schools, right? The claim says \"all the school,\" which might imply all schools, but in this table, it's just these six.

It has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference.\n\nThe claim mentions two schools: north devatur and milan. Wait, looking at the table's \"school\" column, I don't see \"north devatur.\" Instead, there are entries like \"eastern hancock,\" \"indian creek,\" \"knightstown,\" \"milan,\" \"north decatur,\" and \"south decatur.\" So maybe it's a typo. Perhaps it should be \"north decatur\" instead of \"north devatur\"? That makes sense because \"north decatur\" is in the table.\n\nSo, I need to check if both \"north decatur\" and \"milan\" have \"ohio river valley\" as their primary conference. Looking at the table:\n\n- For \"north decatur,\" which is row 5 (since rows are numbered starting from 0?), wait no, let me count again. The first row after the header is index 0: eastern hancock, then 1: indian creek, 2: knightstown, 3: milan, 4: north decatur, 5: south decatur.\n\nWait, no, looking at the markdown table, each row corresponds to a school:\n\nRow 0: eastern hancock\nRow 1: indian creek\nRow 2: knightstown\nRow 3: milan\nRow 4: north decatur\nRow 5: south decatur\n\nSo \"north decatur\" is in row 4. Its primary conference is listed as \"ohio river valley.\" That's correct.\n\nNow, \"milan\" is in row 3. Looking at the \"primary conference\" column for row 3, it says \"ohio river valley.\" So yes, milan also has that primary conference.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"north devatur,\" which isn't in the table as such; perhaps it's a typo for \"north decatur,\" which is present. So both north decatur and milan do share ohio river valley as their primary conference.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells. For each of these two schools, I need their row indices and the column name, which is \"primary conference.\"\n\nSo for north decatur: it's in row 4, so row_index is 4, column_name is \"primary conference.\"\n\nFor milan: it's in row 3, same column.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"north devatur,\" not \"north decatur.\" So if the claim is using \"north devatur\" instead of \"north decatur,\" then perhaps it's incorrect. But maybe I should check based on the table as given. Since \"north devatur\" isn't in the table, but \"north decatur\" is, and the claim might have a typo.\n\nAssuming that the user intended to refer to \"north decatur,\" which exists, then both north decatur and milan share ohio river valley.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim uses \"north devatur,\" which doesn't exist, then it's incorrect.

That's good; they are distinct entries.\n\nNext, the key aspect of the claim is about the number of student enrollments being exactly the same for both schools. To verify this, I need to look at the \"enrollment\" column for each school.\n\nStarting with north decatur (row 5), the enrollment figure is listed as 397. Moving on to south decatur (row 6), its enrollment is also given as 316. Now, comparing these two numbers: 397 vs. 316. These are not equal; they differ by 81 students.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided in the table, north decatur and south decatur do not have the same number of student enrollments. The claim made is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"north decatur and south decatur have the exact same number of student enrollment,\" I checked both schools' enrollments from the table. North Decatur has 397 students, while South Decatur has 316, which are not equal.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}",
