    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim: \"22506 crowd saw the game with a 3rd group position.\" So, the claim mentions two things\u2014 the number of attendees (22506) and their group position being third.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, opponents, h/a, result f-a, attendance, and group position. The claim is specifically about attendance and group position. \n\nI should focus on the 'attendance' column and the 'group position' column for each relevant row. Let's go through each row to see if any of them match both parts of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first row: date 13 September, opponents Anderlecht, home game, attendance 62749, group position 1st. The attendance is over 60k but the group position isn't third, so this doesn't match.\n\nSecond row: Dynamo Kyiv visitors, a game, 65000 attendees, 1st position. Again, not matching the claim's group position or attendance.\n\nThird row: PSV Eindhoven away, attendance 30500, group position 2nd. No, because it's about third place and a lower number of attendees.\n\nFourth row: PSV Eindhoven at home, result 3-1, attendance over 66k, group position remains 1st. Not relevant here either.\n\nFifth row: Anderlecht visitors, attendance 22506, which matches the claim's number. Now check the group position. The fifth row shows a 3rd place. So both parts of the claim are present here\u2014 22506 attendance and 3rd position. That seems to match.\n\nSixth row: Dynamo Kyiv at home, higher attendance but group position is 2nd. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo only one cell matches: in row index 4 (since rows start at 0), attendance column. Also, the group position for that row is third, so we need both 'attendance' and 'group position' columns. Wait, no\u2014the claim mentions a specific attendance number (22506) and a group position of third. So I should check each row's attendance against 22506 and their group position against third.\n\nLooking again, the fifth row has attendance 22506 and group position 3rd, which is exactly what the claim says. Therefore, this row is relevant for both parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group position\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the result score of the game against dynamo kyiv , with 1st group position , be 0 - 0.\" \n\nI'll need to parse this into key components:\n1. The opponent is Dynamo Kyiv.\n2. The result is a score of 0-0.\n3. The team has a 1st group position.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details: date, opponents, whether it's a home (h) or away (a) game, the result, attendance, and group position.\n\nI'll start by identifying rows where the opponent is Dynamo Kyiv. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Anderlecht\n- Row 2: Opponent is Dynamo Kyiv\n- Row 3: Opponent is PSV Eindhoven\n- Row 4: Opponent is PSV Eindhoven\n- Row 5: Opponent is Anderlecht\n- Row 6: Opponent is Dynamo Kyiv\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row 2 and row 6.\n\nNext, I'll check each of these rows to see if they match all conditions in the claim. The claim mentions a game against Dynamo Kyiv with a result score of 0-0 and 1st group position.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- Opponent: Dynamo Kyiv\n- Result: 0 - 0\n\nSo, this row directly matches the opponent and the result specified. But what about the group position? In row 2, the group position is 1st. That's a match as well.\n\nNow, let's check row 6:\n- Opponent: Dynamo Kyiv\n- Result: 1 - 0\n\nThis doesn't match the claimed result of 0-0. So row 6 isn't relevant for this claim.\n\nTherefore, only row 2 meets all the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should also ensure that there's no other Dynamo Kyiv game with a 0-0 result and 1st position. From the table, row 2 is the only one where both opponent and result match, and it has a group position of 1st.\n\nSo, since this row exists, the claim is supported as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the attendance on October 18, 2000 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The table has several columns: date, opponents, h/a, result f-a, attendance, and group position.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the attendance of the game on october 18 , 2000 be 66313\". So I need to find the row in the table where the date is October 18, 2000. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nThe first row is September 13, 2000\u2014nope, that's not October 18. Second row is September 19, 2000\u2014still September. Third row is September 26, 2000\u2014not October. Fourth row: October 18, 2000. Yes, that's the one.\n\nNow I need to check the attendance column for this specific row. According to the table, on October 18, 2000, the attendance was 66,313. So the claim is stating exactly that number.\n\nTherefore, since the attendance matches what's in the table, the claim should be TRUE. Now, I have to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the one for date (row index 3) and the attendance column (row index 3).\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we compare the stated attendance on October 18, 2000 with the table's data.\n\n- **Date**: October 18, 2000 (row 3)\n- **Attendance**: 66,313\n\nBoth match, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells that support this decision.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"22506 crowd saw the game with a 2nd group position and the date be september 2000.\" So the claim mentions two specific things: the attendance number (22506) and the group position (2nd), as well as a date in September 2000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match on a particular date. The columns are date, opponents, h/a (home or away), result f - a, attendance, and group position.\n\nI need to check if there's a match where the attendance is exactly 22506, the group position is 2nd, and the date is in September 2000.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **13 september 2000**: Attendance is 62749, not matching.\n2. **19 september 2000**: Group position is 1st, so no match.\n3. **26 september 2000**: Attendance is 30500 and group position is 2nd. Wait, but the date is September, but this row's date is 26th of September, which fits. However, attendance is 30,500, not 22,506. So it doesn't match both attendance and group position.\n4. **18 october 2000**: Attendance is 66,313, so no.\n5. **24 october 2000**: Group position is 3rd, so no.\n6. **8 november 2000**: Attendance is 66,776, which doesn't match.\n\nSo none of the rows have an attendance of 22,506 in September 2000. However, I see that on October 24th, 2000 (which is after September), the group position was 3rd, but the date isn't September. The claim mentions September, so it doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me check again:\n\n- **13 sept**: No\n- **19 sept**: No (group position 1st)\n- **26 sept**: Group pos 2nd, but attendance not matching.\n- Next is October and November dates, none in September except the first three.\n\nSo there's no match with 22,506 attendance, group position 2nd, and date September. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n\nNow, to find relevant cells: we need rows where attendance is 22506 and group position is 2nd, but looking at the table, that doesn't happen in September. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, actually, none of the dates in September have 22,506 except maybe row index 4, which is October 24th. But that's in October, not September, so it's irrelevant to the date part of the claim. Therefore, there are no cells that fully support the claim, meaning the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, looking at row index 2 (26 Sept 2000), attendance is 30500 and group position is 2nd. So if the claim had said \"30500\", it would have been TRUE, but it's 22506, so no match.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are none because there's no data in September with both 22,506 attendance and group position 2nd. So I need to check each row:\n\nFor date: September 2000, look for rows where attendance is 22506.\n\nLooking at the table, only row index 4 (24 October) has 22506, but that's not in September. So no match, hence FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells would be the one with attendance 22506 and group position 2nd, but since there's none in September, perhaps it's just the date cell, but I think all relevant conditions need to be met. Therefore, no relevant cells as none meet both parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by any row in the table that matches all the criteria: attendance of 22506, group position of 2nd, and date in September 2000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the attendance on October 18, 2000 is over 66,313 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the attendance of the game on october 18 , 2000 be over 66313.\"\n\nI'll check each relevant column in the table. The columns are date, opponents, h/a, result f - a, attendance, and group position.\n\nThe key information needed is the attendance for October 18, 2000. So I should look at the 'attendance' column. In the table, that's under \"result f - a\" which is 3 - 1, but that's not important for the claim; what matters is the 'attendance' number.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- 13 september 2000: attendance 62,749\n- 19 september 2000: 65,000\n- 26 september 2000: 30,500\n- 18 October 2000: 66,313\n- 24 October 2000: 22,506\n- 8 November 2000: 66,776\n\nSo the attendance on October 18, 2000 is indeed 66,313. The claim says it's over 66,313. Wait, 66,313 is exactly that number, so does \"over\" mean strictly greater than or equal to? If yes, then it's TRUE. But if \"over\" means more than 66,313, then it would be FALSE because 66,313 isn't more than itself.\n\nWait, the claim says \"attendance... be over 66313.\" So is it exactly 66313? Because in the table, it's written as 66313. So if the claim is about being over that number, meaning higher than, then it would be FALSE because 66,313 isn't more than itself. But if \"over\" includes equal to, then it's TRUE.\n\nHowever, typically, when someone says a number is over X, they mean greater than or equal to. So I think the claim is correct because 66,313 meets that condition. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: The attendance column is the key. The date is October 18, 2000, so in the table, it's the fourth row (index 3) and the 'attendance' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if the attendance on October 18, 2000 was over 66,313. From the table, the attendance for that match is exactly 66,313, which meets the condition of being \"over\" as it includes equal to.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a football match is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the score of the game against dynamo kyiv , with 1st group position , be 1 - 0 and the date be october 24 2000.\"\n\nSo, I need to check each part of this claim against the table. The table has several columns: date, opponents, h/a (home or away), result f-a, attendance, and group position.\n\nI'll start by identifying which parts of the claim correspond to which columns. The claim mentions two main points:\n\n1. The score is 1 - 0.\n2. The game was against Dynamo Kyiv.\n3. The team had a 1st group position on October 24, 2000.\n\nWait, actually, the claim seems to have three parts: the score (1-0), the opponents (Dynamo Kyiv), and the date (October 24, 2000). Also, it mentions the group position is 1st. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find a match where:\n\n- Opponents are Dynamo Kyiv.\n- The result is 1 - 0.\n- The date is October 24, 2000.\n- Group position is 1st.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table to see if any match all these criteria.\n\nRow 0: Date 13 sept 2000 vs Anderlecht. Score 5-1. Not Dynamo Kyiv and not 1-0. So no.\nRow 1: Date 19 sept 2000 vs Dynamo Kyiv, a, score 0-0. Not 1-0. So no.\nRow 2: Date 26 sept 2000 vs Psv Eindhoven, a, score 1-3. Opponent wrong and score not matching.\nRow 3: Date 18 october 2000 vs Psv Eindhoven, h, score 3-1. Opponent wrong.\nRow 4: Date 24 october 2000 vs Anderlecht, a, score 1-2. Opponent is Anderlecht, not Dynamo Kyiv. Also, score is 1-2, not 1-0. So no.\nRow 5: Date 8 november 2000 vs Dynamo Kyiv, h, score 1-0. Here, the opponent is Dynamo Kyiv, and the score is 1-0. But the date here is November 8, not October 24. Also, what about group position? This row shows group position as 2nd.\n\nWait, the claim mentions the date as October 24, which isn't in any of the rows where Dynamo Kyiv is the opponent and score is 1-0. In fact, the only match against Dynamo Kyiv with a 1-0 score is on November 8, but that's not October 24.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"the date be october 24 2000.\" Looking at the table, I don't see any entry for Dynamo Kyiv on October 24. The only match against Dynamo Kyiv with a score of 1-0 is on November 8, which is in row 5.\n\nSo, the claim seems to have two issues: first, there's no game against Dynamo Kyiv on October 24 with a score of 1-0; second, the group position for that match (November 8) was 2nd, not 1st as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because:\n\n- There's no game on October 24 against Dynamo Kyiv with a 1-0 score.\n- Even if such a game existed, the group position on November 8 was 2nd, so claiming it's 1st would be wrong.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be FALSE. Now, to find which cells are relevant. The claim refers to three specific pieces of information: opponents (Dynamo Kyiv), score (1-0), and date (October 24). So, looking at the table:\n\nLooking for Dynamo Kyiv as opponents, score is 1-0, date October 24. None found. But in row 5, the opponent is Dynamo Kyiv, score is 1-0, but date is November 8. Also, group position is 2nd there.\n\nSo, relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Dynamo Kyiv: row index 5.\n- For score: column \"result f - a\".\n- For date: column \"date\".\n\nBut the claim mentions all three, so I need to check each part. Since none of them exactly match (score and date don't align), all these cells are relevant to disprove the claim.\n\nWait, but in the table, there is no game against Dynamo Kyiv on October 24 with a 1-0 score. So, all three aspects are incorrect, but each is a separate part that's being claimed. Therefore, each cell related to those points would be relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that a match against Dynamo Kyiv occurred on October 24, 2000, with a score of 1-0 and group position 1st. However, the table shows no such game, and the only match against Dynamo Kyiv with a 1-0 score is on November 8, 2000, which was in the 2nd group position. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"h / a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
