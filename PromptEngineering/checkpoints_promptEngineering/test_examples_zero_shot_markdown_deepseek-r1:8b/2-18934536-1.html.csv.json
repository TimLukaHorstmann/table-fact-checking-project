    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"most of the standard name for asymmetric digital subscriber line start with itu.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see how many standard names start with \"ITU\". \n\nStarting with adsl:\n- Row 0: adsl\n- Row 1: ITU G992.1 Annex A and B are labeled as adsl over pots and adsl over ISDN, but their standard names don't seem to start with ITU directly.\nWait, no. The \"standard name\" column is the second one. So for adsl, the first row's standard name is \"adsl\", which doesn't start with ITU. Row 1 has \"ITU G992.1\" as part of the description but the standard name is \"adsl (gdmt)\". Hmm, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, looking again: \n\nEach row's structure is version | standard name | common name | downstream rate | upstream rate.\n\nSo for adsl:\n\n- Row 0: standard name is adsl\n- Row 1: standard name is ITU G992.1 Annex A\nNo, wait: the third row under adsl has \"ITU G992.1 annex a\" as part of the description, but the standard name is \"adsl over pots\". Wait, no: the second column is the standard name.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the standard names:\n\n- adsl\n- ITU G992.1 (row 1)\n- ITU G992.1 Annex A (row 2)\n- ITU G992.1 Annex B (row3)\n- ITU G992.2 (row4)\n- ITU G992.3 (row5)\n- ITU G992.3 Annex J and L (rows6,7)\n- ITU G992.4 (row8)\n- ITU G992.5 (row9)\n- ITU G992.5 Annex M (row10)\n- Row 11: standard name is adsl4\n\nWait no, row11's version is \"adsl2 + +\" and the standard name is \"(up to 3.75 mhz)\", which doesn't start with ITU. So that's not relevant.\n\nSo now, listing all the standard names:\n\nRow0: adsl\nRow1: ITU G992.1\nWait no, row1's standard name is \"ITU G992.1 Annex A\"? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the table seems to have a header: version | standard name | common name | downstream rate | upstream rate.\n\nSo each row's second column is the standard name. Let me list all standard names correctly:\n\n- adsl (row0)\n- ITU G992.1 (row1) -> Wait no, looking at row1, it says \"ITU G992.1\" as part of the description but the standard name is \"adsl (gdmt)\". No, wait: row1's version is adsl, and standard name is \"itu g992.1\", right?\n\nWait no, in the table:\n\nRow0: version=adsl, standard name=ansi t1.413 - 1998 issue 2\nRow1: version=adsl, standard name=ITU G992.1\nRow2: version=adsl, standard name=ITU G992.1 Annex A\nRow3: version=adsl, standard name=ITU G992.1 Annex B\nRow4: version=adsl, standard name=ITU G992.2\nRow5: version=adsl2, standard name=ITU G992.3\nRow6: version=adsl2, standard name=ITU G992.3 Annex J\nRow7: version=adsl2, standard name=ITU G992.3 Annex L\nRow8: version=adsl2, standard name=ITU G992.4\nRow9: version=adsl2 +, standard name=ITU G992.5\nRow10: version=adsl2 +, standard name=ITU G992.5 Annex M\nRow11: version=adsl2 + +, standard name=(up to 3.75 mhz) which doesn't start with ITU.\n\nSo the standard names that start with ITU are:\n\n- row1: ITU G992.1\n- row2: ITU G992.1 Annex A\n- row3: ITU G992.1 Annex B\n- row4: ITU G992.2\n- row5: ITU G992.3\n- row6: ITU G992.3 Annex J\n- row7: ITU G992.3 Annex L\n- row8: ITU G992.4\n- row9: ITU G992.5\n- row10: ITU G992.5 Annex M\n\nSo that's 10 standard names starting with ITU.\n\nBut wait, how many total standard names are there? Let's count all the rows:\n\nRows 0 to 11 (12 rows), each has a standard name.\n\nStandard names:\n\nRow0: adsl\nRow1: ITU G992.1\nRow2: ITU G992.1 Annex A\nRow3: ITU G992.1 Annex B\nRow4: ITU G992.2\nRow5: ITU G992.3\nRow6: ITU G992.3 Annex J\nRow7: ITU G992.3 Annex L\nRow8: ITU G992.4\nRow9: ITU G992.5\nRow10: ITU G992.5 Annex M\nRow11: (up to 3.75 mhz)\n\nSo rows1-10 have standard names starting with ITU, which is 10 entries. But row11 does not.\n\nWait, but for adsl2 + and adsl2 + +, the standard name is ITU G992.5 and its annex M. So that's two more under adsl2 +.\n\nSo total standard names starting with ITU: from row1 to row10, which is 10.\n\nTotal standard names across all versions: 12 (each row has one).\n\nWait no, each version may have multiple standard names if there are multiple entries for the same version. For example, adsl2 has rows5-8: row5=ITU G992.3, row6=ITU G992.3 Annex J, etc.\n\nBut the question is about the standard names, regardless of the version.\n\nSo from all 12 standard names, how many start with ITU?\n\nRows1 to10: 10 standard names start with ITU.\n\nRow11: does not.\n\nSo total of 10.\n\nTherefore, out of 12 standard names, 10 start with ITU.\n\nBut wait, row0: adsl is also a standard name that doesn't start with ITU.\n\nSo if we're considering the task: \"You are tasked to find how many standards in this table start with 'ITU'\".\n\nThen the answer would be 10.\n\nBut the question says: \"You are tasked to analyze the number of standards with names starting with the letters ITU.\"\n\nSo perhaps the answer is 10.\n\nAlternatively, if considering each version as a separate standard, but I think each row represents a different standard within a category (like adsl has multiple versions). So each row's second column is a distinct standard name.\n\nThus, total of 12 standards, 10 starting with ITU.\n\nTherefore, the number of standards with names starting with ITU is 10.\n\nWait, but wait: in the initial analysis, I think rows1-10 are the ones where standard names start with ITU. So that's 10 out of 12.\n\nHence, the answer would be 10.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\nRow0: adsl - no\nRow1: ITU G992.1 - yes (1)\nRow2: ITU G992.1 Annex A - yes (2)\nRow3: ITU G992.1 Annex B - yes (3)\nRow4: ITU G992.2 - yes (4)\nRow5: ITU G992.3 - yes (5)\nRow6: ITU G992.3 Annex J - yes (6)\nRow7: ITU G992.3 Annex L - yes (7)\nRow8: ITU G992.4 - yes (8)\nRow9: ITU G992.5 - yes (9)\nRow10: ITU G992.5 Annex M - yes (10)\nRow11: no\n\nSo 10 standards start with ITU.\n\nBut the task is to find how many standards have names starting with ITU, so 10.\n\nWait, but row1's standard name is \"ITU G992.1\", which starts with ITU.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10.\n</think>\n\nThe number of standards with names starting with ITU is **10**.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{10} standards with names starting with ITU.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says, \"common name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: version, standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate. Each row represents a different version or variant of ADSL.\n\nThe key here is to check if the \"common name\" column includes \"ADSL\" in its entries, specifically for asymmetric digital subscriber line. From my understanding, ADSL is indeed a type of broadband technology used by ISPs. So I'm expecting that there should be entries under the common name that mention \"ADSL.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row under adsl has \"adsl\" as the common name.\n- The second row again mentions \"adsl (gdmt)\" and \"adsl over pots.\"\n- The third row is \"adsl over isdn.\"\n- The fourth row also lists \"adsl over isdn\" with different upstream rates.\n- The fifth row refers to \"adsl lite (glite).\"\n- The sixth row is \"adsl2.\"\n- The seventh and eighth rows mention \"adsl2\" again, including variations like \"re-adsl2.\"\n- The ninth row is \"splitterless adsl2.\"\n- The tenth row is \"adsl2 +\", with different common names.\n- The eleventh row mentions \"adsl2 + m.\"\n- The twelfth row refers to \"adsl4.\"\n\nSo, all these common names include \"ADSL\" in some form. However, the claim specifically says that the common name includes \"ADSL for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" I need to verify if \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" is explicitly mentioned as a common name.\n\nLooking at each row's common name:\n\n- The first five rows mention \"adsl,\" \"adsl (gdmt),\" etc., but not \"asymmetric digital subscriber line.\"\n- Starting from the sixth row, it changes to \"adsl2,\" which might imply an upgrade or a newer version.\n- The claim refers to asymmetric digital subscriber line, which is another term for ADSL. But in the table, the common names are more like \"adsl\" and then variations like \"adsl2,\" \"adsl4,\" etc., rather than explicitly stating \"asymmetric digital subscriber line.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The standard name and common name might not always be the same. For example, the first row's standard name is \"ansi t1.413 - 1998 issue 2\" with a common name of \"adsl.\" So in that case, \"adsl\" is both a standard name and a common name.\n\nBut for the claim, it's about whether the common names include \"ADSL for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" So I need to check if any row's common name specifically states \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" (ASDSL). From the table, none of the common names directly say ASDSL. They just have variations like adsl, adsl2, splitterless adsl2, etc.\n\nHowever, maybe the claim is referring to the fact that all these variants are under the umbrella term ADSL. So in a way, all those common names do include ADSL as part of their lineage or standard name. But does \"include adsl\" mean that \"ADSL\" is explicitly mentioned as part of the common name?\n\nLooking at each row's common name:\n\n- Row 0: adsl\n- Row 1: adsl (gdmt)\n- Row 2: adsl over pots\n- Row 3: adsl over isdn\n- Row 4: adsl lite (glite)\n- Row 5: adsl2\n- Row 6: adsl2\n- Row 7: re-adsl2\n- Row 8: splitterless adsl2\n- Row 9: adsl2 +\n- Row 10: adsl2 + m\n- Row 11: adsl4\n\nSo in all these cases, the common names either start with \"adsl\" or have \"adsl\" as part of their name. Therefore, the claim is saying that the common names include ADSL for ASDSL. Since all these variants are under ADSL, I think it's correct to say that the common names include ADSL.\n\nBut wait, does \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" need to be explicitly mentioned? The term ASDSL might not always be used; sometimes it's just referred to as ADSL or its variations. So perhaps the claim is slightly misleading because it refers to \"asymmetric digital subscriber line,\" which might not be a standard term used in the table.\n\nAlternatively, since all common names include \"ADSL\" either directly or as part of their name, maybe the claim is true. However, I'm a bit confused because ASDSL isn't explicitly mentioned. So perhaps the claim is TRUE because ADSL is included in the common names, even though it's not specified as ASDSL.\n\nWait, another angle: The standard name for some entries includes \"ITU G.992.X,\" which are different standards for ADSL, but the common names include variations like adsl, adsl2, etc., but not explicitly mentioning ASDSL.\n\nSo maybe the claim is FALSE because it's specifically referring to asymmetric digital subscriber line, which isn't a term used in the table's common names. Instead, they use terms like adsl and its variants.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn here. The claim says \"common name include adsl for asymmetric...\" So perhaps it's saying that the common names list ADSL as part of their terminology, which is true because the first row is just \"adsl.\" So maybe the claim is TRUE because at least one entry has \"adsl\" as the common name.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim requires that all entries include \"ADSL,\" then it's FALSE because some only have \"adsl2,\" etc., without explicitly stating ADSL in their common names. But I think the key is whether \"adsl\" appears as a common name. Since it does (in the first row), maybe the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but the claim says that the common names include \"ADSL for asymmetric...\" So it's not just mentioning ADSL, but specifically ASDSL. The table doesn't mention ASDSL in any common name. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because none of the common names explicitly mention asymmetric digital subscriber line; they only mention variations like adsl and adsl2.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is that the claim is TRUE because all these variants fall under ADSL, so their common names include ADSL as part of their nomenclature. But if \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" isn't explicitly mentioned, then it's FALSE.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me look up: ADSL and ASDSL are sometimes used interchangeably, but technically, ASDSL is a subset of ADSL. So maybe the common names don't explicitly mention ASDSL, so the claim might be incorrect in that aspect.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the answer is that the claim is TRUE because all these variations are under ADSL, making their common names include ADSL as part of their terminology.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the common names of various telecommunication technologies include \"ADSL for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" \n\nUpon examining the provided table, each row lists a standard name and a corresponding common name. The common names include variations such as \"adsl,\" \"adsl2,\" \"splitterless adsl2,\" etc., but none explicitly mention \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" (ASDSL). However, all these variants are subsumed under the broader term ADSL.\n\nGiven this, while the term ASDSL isn't explicitly used in the common names, the technologies listed do fall under the umbrella of ADSL. Therefore, the claim can be interpreted as TRUE because ADSL is included as part of their nomenclature, even if ASDSL itself isn't mentioned explicitly.\n\nAnswer: **True**",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the highest downstream rate for asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) being 52.0 mbit/s is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the maximum downstream rate for ADSL is 52.0 mbit/s. So I need to look through the table and find all entries related to ADSL and their downstream rates to verify if this claim holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists different versions of ADSL (adsl, adsl2, adsl2 +, etc.) along with their standard names, common names, upstream and downstream rates. My main focus here is on the 'downstream rate' column for each version related to ADSL.\n\nStarting from the top, I'll go through each row that mentions ADSL in some form:\n\n1. **adsl**:\n   - Downstream rate: 08.0 mbit/s\n   - This seems lower compared to other entries.\n\n2. **adsl2**:\n   - Different downstream rates depending on the annex (like j, l, etc.). The highest here is 12.0 mbit/s.\n   \n3. **adsl2 +**:\n   - Here, for itu g992.5 annex m, the downstream rate is 24.0 mbit/s.\n\n4. **adsl2 + +**:\n   - This row mentions \"up to 3.75 MHz\" but under downstream rate it's listed as 52.0 mbit/s. I need to clarify what this means. It might be that this is the maximum theoretical or achievable rate, not necessarily the standard.\n\nNow, considering the claim says the highest downstream rate for ADSL is 52.0 mbit/s. From the table:\n\n- The adsl2 + + row shows a downstream rate of 52.0 mbit/s.\n- The other entries have lower rates: up to 24.0 or 12.0.\n\nSo, does this mean that 52.0 mbit/s is indeed the highest? I need to check if there's any higher rate elsewhere in the table for ADSL versions.\n\nLooking further, all other downstream rates under the 'downstream rate' column are either lower than 52.0 or equal (like adsl2 + has 24.0). So yes, 52.0 seems to be the highest among all listed ADSL downstream rates.\n\nWait a minute, but I should also consider whether \"adsl2 + +\" is indeed part of the ADSL family. From the table, it's under 'version' as \"adsl2 + +\" and has standard name \"(up to 3.75 mhz)\", which suggests it's an advanced version beyond standard ADSL2+. Therefore, this higher rate would be applicable.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim appears to be TRUE because the table shows that the highest downstream rate for ADSL is indeed 52.0 mbit/s.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about the highest downstream rate of ADSL being 52.0 mbit/s is true, we examine the relevant cells in the provided table.\n\nThe highest downstream rate listed in the table under the \"downstream rate\" column for any version related to ADSL (adsl, adsl2, adsl2 +, and adsl2 + +) is indeed 52.0 mbit/s as shown in the row corresponding to adsl2 + +.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the highest upstream rate be 5.0 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" So I'm looking for an entry in the table that has an upstream rate of exactly 5.0 mbit/s and is related to asymmetric DSL (ADSL).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different version or type of DSL, with various standard names, common names, downstream rates, and upstream rates.\n\nFirst, I should identify rows where the upstream rate is 5.0 mbit/s.\n\nScanning through the table:\n\n- Row 4: adsl2 + + has an upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s.\n- Any others? Let me check all the rows again.\n\nRow 4 (ADSL2+ with I.992.5 annex M) has 3.3 mbit/s downstream and 5.0 mbit/s upstream. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, no. The row for adsl2 + + (up to 3.75 MHz) is the last one. Its upstream rate is listed as 5.0 mbit/s.\n\nNow, I need to check if this entry corresponds to \"asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" In the table, each row has a standard name and common name.\n\nRow 4: The standard name is itu g992.5 annex m, and the common name is adsl2 + m. Wait, but what's the version? It says 'adsl2 +', which might indicate it's an advanced version beyond regular ADLS.\n\nWait, looking at the columns:\n\n- The \"standard name\" column has entries like itu g992.x, which are specific standards.\n- The \"common name\" gives names like adsl, adsl2, etc.\n\nSo for the row in question (ADSL2 + +), the common name is adsl4. So that might be a different iteration or name for the same technology.\n\nWait, no: the last row is:\n\n| adsl2 + + | (up to 3.75 mhz)           | adsl4               | 52.0 mbit / s     | 5.0 mbit / s    |\n\nSo the common name here is \"adsl4.\" So does that count as \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\"? I think ADLS and ADLS2 are types of asymmetric DSL, so perhaps adsl4 is an extension or newer version.\n\nBut wait, the claim refers to \"asymmetric digital subscriber line,\" which might include any of these versions, like adsl, adsl2, etc. So if there's a row where the upstream rate is 5.0 mbit/s and it's under ADLS, that would support the claim.\n\nLooking back, in the table:\n\n- The last row (ADSL2 + +) has an upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s.\n- Its common name is adsl4, but earlier rows have different versions like adsl, adsl2.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the row with \"re - adsl2\" in the standard name? Let me check that.\n\nLooking at row 3 (row_index=8):\n\n| adsl2     | itu g992.3 annex l         | re - adsl2          | 05.0 5.0 mbit / s | 0.8 mbit / s    |\n\nSo this has a downstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s but upstream is 0.8. So that's not the one.\n\nThe other row with 5.0 upstream is row_index=9 (the last row), which is under adsl2 + +, with a common name of adsl4 and upstream 5.0.\n\nSo does \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" include adsl4? I think ADLS refers to the original, then ADLS2, etc., but perhaps in this table, adsl4 is considered part of it.\n\nWait, no, the claim specifically says \"asymmetric digital subscriber line,\" which may not include higher iterations like 2+ or 4. It might just refer to the basic ADSL.\n\nBut looking at the rows:\n\n- The first three rows (adsl) have upstream rates: 1.0, 1.3, 1.8 mbit/s.\n- The next four are adsl2 with varying upstreams, including 1.3, 3.5, 0.8, and 0.5.\n- Then the last two rows are adsl2 +, with higher rates.\n\nSo none of the 'adsl' rows (the first five) have an upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s except the last row, which is under 'adsl2 + +' with common name adsl4.\n\nTherefore, if the claim refers to ADLS in general, then the highest upstream rate in regular ADSL isn't 5.0 but lower. But in this table, the only entry with upstream rate 5.0 is under 'adsl2 + +', which might not be considered part of the basic asymmetric digital subscriber line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'asymmetric digital subscriber line' encompasses all versions, including adsl4. So if that's the case, then yes, there is a version (adsl4) with upstream rate 5.0 mbit/s.\n\nBut I'm not sure if 'adsl4' is considered part of the asymmetric digital subscriber line in this context. It might be an extension or a newer standard.\n\nSo to check: The claim says \"the highest upstream rate be 5.0 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" So we need to see if, within any version of ADLS, the upstream rate reaches 5.0 mbit/s.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The only entry with 5.0 upstream is row 9 (adsl2 + +), which has a common name of adsl4.\n\nAssuming that 'asymmetric digital subscriber line' includes all versions from ADSL to ADSL4, then yes, there's an entry supporting it.\n\nAlternatively, if the term refers only to the original ADLS without the plus, then no.\n\nBut in most contexts, I think ADLS2 and beyond are considered part of the asymmetric DSL family. So the highest upstream rate in that family is 52 mbit/s downstream and 5 mbit/s upstream in adsl4.\n\nTherefore, since adsl4 is a type of asymmetric digital subscriber line, there exists an entry with 5.0 mbit/s upstream. Thus, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data presented in the table. Specifically, within the category of \"asymmetric digital subscriber line,\" which includes various iterations such as ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL4, there exists a version\u2014ADSL4\u2014that has an upstream data rate of 5.0 mbit/s. This aligns with the claim that the highest upstream rate for this type of line can reach 5.0 mbit/s.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the highest upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s is achieved by ADSL4, a specific iteration within the asymmetric digital subscriber line category.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"the lowest downstream rate achievable be 1.5 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, which lists various versions of ADSL and their corresponding downstream and upstream rates, I need to find if there's a version where the downstream rate is exactly 1.5 mbit/s.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with the first rows under \"adsl\":\n- The first adsl row shows a downstream rate of 8.0 mbit/s.\n- Next, it's 8.0 mbit/s again for another version.\n- Then, there are entries for annex A and B, both at 12.0 mbit/s.\n- The last adsl row is for adsl lite (glite) with 1.5 mbit/s downstream.\n\nSo here, the adsl2 rows:\n- The first adsl2 row has a downstream rate of 12.0 mbit/s.\n- The annex J and L versions also have higher rates, 12.0 and 5.0 respectively.\n- The splitterless adsl2 is back to 1.5 mbit/s.\n\nThen, under adsl2 +:\n- The first version has 20.0 downstream, which is higher.\n- Annex M goes up to 24.0.\n\nFinally, the adsl2+ + row mentions up to 3.75 MHz but that's for frequency and not directly related to downstream rate.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim: it refers to asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL). In the table, I see versions labeled as adsl, adsl2, etc., so I need to check all entries with \"adsl\" or similar in their standard name.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- The first two rows under adsl have higher rates.\n- Then, the fifth row is adsl lite (glite) with downstream rate 1.5 mbit/s.\n- Later, under adsl2, splitterless adsl2 also has 1.5 mbit/s.\n\nSo both adsl and adsl2 versions have a downstream rate of 1.5 mbit/s at different points. The lowest in the table is indeed 1.0 mbit/s for some upstream rates, but the claim specifically mentions the lowest downstream rate being 1.5.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple entries where the downstream rate is 1.5, so the claim holds as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that rare names include \"adsl\" for asymmetric digital subscriber line. So, I'm looking for entries in the table where \"adsl\" is used as a less common name alongside its more common name.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the version (like adsl, adsl2, etc.), standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate. My focus should be on the 'common name' column because that's where the alternative names are listed.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **adsl**: \n   - Standard name: ANSI T1.413-1998 Issue 2\n   - Common name: adsl\n   Here, the common name is \"adsl,\" which is the same as the standard name in this case. However, looking further down, there are other entries where the standard and common names differ.\n\n2. **adsl**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.1\n   - Common name: adsl (gdmt)\n   The common name here adds \"gdmt\" to the standard name. So, this row shows that \"adsl\" is a common name with another designation.\n\n3. **adsl**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.1 Annex A\n   - Common name: adsl over pots\n   Here, \"adsl over pots\" is an alternative name.\n\n4. **adsl**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.1 Annex B\n   - Common name: adsl over isdn\n   Another variation of the common name.\n\n5. **adsl**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.2\n   - Common name: adsl lite (glite)\n   \"glite\" is added, showing another alternative name.\n\n6. **adsl2**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.3\n   - Common name: adsl2\n   The common name here matches the standard name exactly.\n\n7. **adsl2**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.3 Annex J\n   - Common name: adsl2\n   The common name again matches the standard name.\n\n8. **adsl2**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.3 Annex L\n   - Common name: re-adsl2\n   This shows a different alternative name.\n\n9. **adsl2**: \n   - Standard name: ITU G992.4\n   - Common name: splitterless adsl2\n\n10. **adsl2 +**: \n    - Standard name: ITU G992.5\n    - Common name: adsl2 +\n\n11. **adsl2 +**: \n    - Standard name: ITU G992.5 Annex M\n    - Common name: adsl2 + m\n\n12. **adsl2 + +**: \n    - Standard name: (up to 3.75 MHz)\n    - Common name: adsl4\n   The standard name here is a frequency range, and the common name jumps to \"adsl4.\"\n\nFrom this analysis, the claim refers to rare names that include \"adsl.\" Looking at the table, several rows have additional or alternative names beyond just \"adsl\" and \"adsl2,\" such as \"adsl (gdmt),\" \"adsl over pots,\" etc. These seem to be less common names or variations within the adsl category.\n\nHowever, I need to verify if these are considered 'rare' or alternate names specifically for asymmetric digital subscriber line. The term \"adsl\" itself is a standard name, but its variations might be more specialized or less commonly used in certain contexts. Therefore, it's plausible that these are rare or specific names within the same category.\n\nSo, considering all this, the claim seems to hold true because the table does include alternative names like adsl (gdmt), adsl over pots, etc., which could be considered rare variations of the basic adsl name.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains several entries where \"adsl\" is listed as a common name alongside its standard names. These alternative names, such as \"adsl (gdmt)\" and \"adsl over pots,\" are less frequently used but still correctly reference the asymmetric digital subscriber line.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"common name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"common name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the lowest downstream rate for asymmetric digital subscriber line be 52.0 mbit / s.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. It's about the \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" (ADSL).\n2. We're looking at the \"downstream rate.\"\n3. The lowest rate for this should be 52.0 mbit/s.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists different versions of ADSL and their respective downstream and upstream rates. Each row has a version (like adsl, adsl2, etc.), standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate.\n\nSo, my task is to find in this table if there's an entry for ADSL with a downstream rate of 52.0 mbit/s. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- The first rows are about adsl versions: adsl, adsl (gdmt), adsl over pots, adsl over ISDN, and adsl lite (gLite). Their downstream rates range from 1.5 to 12.0 mbit/s.\n\n- Then we have adsl2 variants: adsl2, adsl2 annex j, adsl2 annex l, splitterless adsl2. The downstream rates here go up to 24.0 mbit/s with the annex m version.\n\n- Finally, there's a row for \"adsl2 +\", which I assume is adsl2 plus something. It mentions an upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s and a downstream rate of 52.0 mbit/s. That seems to match part of the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically says \"asymmetric digital subscriber line,\" so we're looking for rows where the version is either adsl or adsl2 or similar.\n\nIn the row labeled \"adsl2 +\", it's under the standard name itu g992.5 annex m and common name adsl2 + m. The downstream rate is 24.0 mbit/s, but upstream is 3.3 mbit/s. Hmm, that's not 52.0. Wait, no\u2014looking again, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, the last row has downstream rate 52.0 mbit/s and upstream 5.0 mbit/s. But it says \"adsl2 +\", which might be a specific type of ADSL2+. So, is this considered part of the overall ADSL category?\n\nI think so because the version is under adsl2+ or similar, but perhaps in the context of the table, each row represents a different variant.\n\nWait, the last row's version is \"adsl2 + +\" with downstream rate 52.0 mbit/s. So that's the only one that hits exactly 52.0 mbit/s downstream.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The claim says \"the lowest downstream rate for asymmetric digital subscriber line be 52.0 mbit/s.\" \n\nIn the table, I need to check all rows where the standard name or common name is related to ADSL. So adsl, adsl2, etc., and see their downstream rates.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- adsl: 08.0, then others up to 12.0.\n- adsl2: up to 24.0 with annex m.\n- adsl2 +: up to 24.0 with annex m? No, wait, the last row is adsl2 + + (up to 3.75 MHz) and downstream rate 52.0.\n\nWait, that's under \"adsl2 + +\" which might be a higher-tier version, perhaps not standard ADSL but an advanced one. So does this count as part of the basic ADSL?\n\nI think so because it's still within the adsl2+ category, which is an evolution beyond standard ADSL.\n\nSo in that case, the downstream rate for \"adsl2 + +\" is 52.0 mbit/s. That would be the highest downstream rate in the table. But the claim says the lowest downstream rate is 52.0. Wait, that doesn't make sense because lower rates exist in previous rows.\n\nWait no\u2014the claim says the lowest downstream rate for ADSL is 52.0. So I'm supposed to find if 52.0 is the minimum downstream rate among all ADSL types.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The adsl versions have downstream rates starting from 1.0 mbit/s up.\n- adsl2 starts with higher rates, like 12.0 and goes up.\n- adsl2 + has even higher downstream rates, including 52.0 in the last row.\n\nSo, if someone claims that the lowest downstream rate for ADSL is 52.0, that would be incorrect because there are lower rates before that. For example, the standard adsl has a downstream of 1.5 mbit/s as per \"adsl lite\" (gLite), which is much lower than 52.0.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because the lowest downstream rate for ADSL isn't 52.0; it's actually lower in some cases, like 1.5 mbit/s.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that different variants of ADSL have varying downstream rates, starting as low as 1.0 or 1.5 mbit/s and increasing up to 52.0 mbit/s. The claim suggests the lowest rate is 52.0, which is incorrect because lower rates exist.\n\n**Answer: \"FALSE\"**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"downstream rate\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the median upstream rate be 5.0 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's about the upstream rate of ADSL being 5.0 mbit/s. The term \"median\" might be a bit tricky here because the table doesn't explicitly mention median rates; it just lists downstream and upstream rates for different versions and variants of ADSL.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are several rows for both adsl and adsl2 categories. Each row has various details like standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate. \n\nI need to find any cells in the table that directly relate to an upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s specifically for ADSL. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first two rows are adsl, but their upstream rates are either 1.0 or 1.3 mbit/s.\n2. The next three rows (adsl2) have upstream rates: 1.3, 3.5, and 0.8 mbit/s respectively.\n3. Then there's an adsl2+ row with 1.1 mbit/s upstream.\n4. Finally, the last row for adsl2++ has a downstream of up to 52 mbit/s but upstream is 5.0 mbit/s.\n\nWait, the last row: it says \"up to 3.75 mhz\" as the standard name, and the upstream rate is 5.0 mbit/s. The common name here is adsl4. So does this mean that in the adsl2++ variant, the upstream rate is 5.0? \n\nBut the claim refers specifically to \"asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" Now, I'm a bit confused because ADSL and ADSL2 are different categories. The last row might be referring to a specific variant within ADSL2 called adsl2++. So perhaps the 5.0 mbit/s upstream rate is part of the adsl2++ variant.\n\nSo, does this satisfy the claim? The claim says \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" which could be interpreted as any ADSL technology, including its variants. However, the table doesn't have a row for just \"adsl\" with an upstream rate of 5.0 mbit/s; that's only in the adsl2++ variant.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"median upstream rate.\" The term \"median\" suggests some sort of average or typical value. The table lists specific rates but doesn't provide statistical data on median values. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this because the table is about specific technologies and their rates rather than aggregations like medians.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a particular variant where the upstream rate is 5.0 mbit/s. In that case, looking for cells where upstream rate is exactly 5.0. The only such cell is in the last row: adsl2++ with upstream rate 5.0 mbit/s.\n\nBut does this apply to \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" in general? Or specifically to a higher variant like adsl2++? If the claim is about any ADSL, including all its variants, then perhaps it's not accurate because only a specific variant has that upstream rate. \n\nWait, but maybe the term \"median\" is a red herring here. The table doesn't provide enough data on median rates across different versions; it just lists individual technologies and their respective rates. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect if it's implying that the median for ADSL in general is 5.0 mbit/s, which isn't supported by the table.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim refers to a specific variant of ADSL where the upstream rate is 5.0, such as adsl2++, then maybe it's true, but the term \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" without specifying the variant would be misleading because different variants have different rates.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. The table shows that in one of the rows, specifically for adsl2++ (or + versions), the upstream rate is 5.0 mbit/s. So perhaps the claim is referring to this specific case. However, the term \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" without further specification might be too broad.\n\nBut looking at how the table is structured, each row specifies different variations or types of ADSL, like adsl2, adsl2+, etc. So if the claim refers to the median upstream rate for the general category of ADSL, then it's not supported because there are multiple variants with varying rates. However, if it refers specifically to a variant like adsl2++ where the upstream rate is 5.0 mbit/s, then maybe it's true.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the median upstream rate be 5.0 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" The term \"median\" suggests that across all ADSL technologies, the median upstream rate is 5.0. But looking at the table:\n\n- adsl: upstream rates are 1.0 and 1.3\n- adsl2: 1.3, 3.5, 0.8\n- adsl2+: 1.1\n- adsl2++: 5.0\n\nSo if we take all these into account, the median of all upstream rates would be something else, not just the higher variant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is only referring to a specific type, but the wording says \"asymmetric digital subscriber line\" without specifying further, which could imply any ADSL technology.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is FALSE because the table doesn't show that the median upstream rate for all ADSL types is 5.0 mbit/s; instead, only a specific variant of adsl2++ has that upstream rate.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"upstream rate\"}]}",

The claim says: \"the median downstream rate achieve be 1.5 mbit / s for asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has several columns: version, standard name, common name, downstream rate, and upstream rate. There are multiple rows with different versions like adsl, adsl2, etc., each with their respective standard names and rates.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the median downstream rate for asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL). So I need to find in the table any entries that match this description. Let me go through each row.\n\nStarting from the top: The first row is adsl with standard name ANSI T1.413 - 1998 Issue 2, common name ADSL, downstream rate 08.0 8.0 mbit/s, upstream 1.0 mbit/s. That's probably an older version of ADSL.\n\nNext row for adsl has ITU G992.1 as the standard name, with the common name ADSL (GDMT), downstream at 8.0 mbit/s and upstream 1.3 mbit/s. Then another row for ITU G992.1 Annex A: ADSL over POTS with downstream 12.0 and upstream 1.3.\n\nThen there's ITU G992.1 Annex B: ADSL over ISDN, same as above but different upstream rate. Next is ITU G992.2: ADSL Lite (GLite), downstream 1.5 mbit/s and upstream 0.5 mbit/s.\n\nNow moving to adsl2 rows: ITU G992.3 for standard name, common name ADSL2, downstream 12.0, upstream 1.3. Then Annex J: same common name, higher upstream. Annex L is RE-ADSL2 with lower upstream.\n\nNext row: ITU G992.4: Splitterless ADSL2, again 1.5 mbit/s downstream and 0.5 upstream.\n\nThen the adsl2 + rows: ITU G992.5 for standard, common name ADSL2+, with higher rates. Annex M has even higher rates.\n\nFinally, a row that's not clearly labeled, just says \"up to 3.75 MHz\" as the standard name, but lists downstream at 52 mbit/s and upstream 5.0 mbit/s, with common name ADSL4.\n\nNow, looking for the claim: median downstream rate is 1.5 mbit/s for ADSL. So I need to find rows where the version is ADSL or a variation, standard name includes something like GLite or similar, and the downstream rate is 1.5.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For adsl, ITU G992.2: ADSL Lite (GLite) has downstream 1.5 mbit/s.\n- Then in adsl2 rows, there's ITU G992.4: Splitterless ADSL2, also 1.5 downstream.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" So perhaps both GLite and splitterless are under ADSL umbrella.\n\nSo I think two cells might be relevant here:\n\n- row_index for GLite (adsl version) is row 4.\n- row_index for Splitterless ADSL2 (adsl2 version) is row 8.\n\nWait, let me count the rows. The table starts with adsl and then adsl2+, etc. Let me list them out:\n\n1. adsl - G992.1\n2. adsl - G992.1 Annex A\n3. adsl - G992.1 Annex B\n4. adsl - G992.2 (GLite)\n5. adsl2 - G992.3\n6. adsl2 - G992.3 Annex J\n7. adsl2 - G992.3 Annex L (RE-ADSL2)\n8. adsl2 - G992.4 (Splitterless ADSL2)\n9. adsl2+ - G992.5\n10. adsl2+ - G992.5 Annex M\n11. adsl2+ + - up to 3.75 MHz, common name ADSL4.\n\nSo row indices are from 0 to 10? Wait, the first column is version and row indexes start at 0:\n\n- Row 0: adsl, ANSI T1.413...\n- Row 1: adsl, ITU G992.1\n- Row 2: adsl, G992.1 Annex A\n- Row 3: adsl, G992.1 Annex B\n- Row 4: adsl, G992.2 (GLite)\n- Row 5: adsl2, G992.3\n- Row 6: adsl2, G992.3 Annex J\n- Row 7: adsl2, G992.3 Annex L\n- Row 8: adsl2, G992.4 (Splitterless ADSL2)\n- Row 9: adsl2+, G992.5\n- Row10: adsl2+, G992.5 Annex M\n- Row11: adsl2++ or something, but not sure.\n\nWait, the table provided in markdown shows rows starting from row 0 as adsl, then another adsl row, etc., up to a few more.\n\nBut for the claim, I'm focusing on downstream rate being 1.5 mbit/s for ADSL. So in row4 (GLite) and row8 (Splitterless ADSL2), we have 1.5 downstream rates under different versions but both falling under the broader ADSL category.\n\nSo these would be relevant cells because they support the claim that in some cases, the downstream rate is 1.5 mbit/s for ADSL.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains entries where the downstream rate is 1.5 mbit/s for two different versions of ADSL: ADSL Lite (GLite) and Splitterless ADSL2. These directly support the claim about the median downstream rate being 1.5 mbit/s for asymmetric digital subscriber lines.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevantRows\": [\n    {\n      \"rowIndex\": 4,\n      \"version\": \"adsl\",\n      \"standardName\": \"ITU G992.2\",\n      \"downstreamRate\": \"1.5 mbit/s\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rowIndex\": 8,\n      \"version\": \"adsl2\",\n      \"standardName\": \"ITU G992.4\",\n      \"downstreamRate\": \"1.5 mbit/s\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
