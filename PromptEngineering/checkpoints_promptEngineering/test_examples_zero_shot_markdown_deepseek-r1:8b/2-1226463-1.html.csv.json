    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"jackie oliver compete in 13 race from 1967 - 1977\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what the claim is saying. It mentions Jackie Oliver competing in 13 races over a span of ten years (from 1967 to 1977). So, I'm looking for any entries in the table that have \"Jackie Oliver\" as the entrant and perhaps other details like the number of points.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row has an entrant. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The first row is \"lotus components ltd\" (1967)\n- Next two rows are \"gold leaf team lotus\" (1968)\n- Then several entries for \"owen racing organisation\" (multiple in 1969)\n- Some for \"yardley team brm\" and \"bruce mclaren motor racing\"\n- A row for \"marlboro brm\" in 1972\n- \"uop shadow racing team\" in 1977\n\nI don't see any entry that mentions Jackie Oliver. The closest might be \"bruce mclaren motor racing,\" but that's a different person, not Jackie Oliver. Also, \"yardley team brm\" is another entrant, which doesn't match.\n\nThe claim states there are 13 races in total. However, the table only lists entries up to 1977 and each year has multiple entrants but no mention of Jackie Oliver. Additionally, each race entry in the table includes points (pts), but since Jackie isn't listed as an entrant, there's no way she competed here.\n\nSo, putting it together: There's no evidence in the table that Jackie Oliver was an entrant during those years. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"jackie oliver drive a brm p153 with a brm v12 engine 2 time.\" Hmm, that seems a bit off because I'm not sure if Jackie Oliver actually drove a BRM P153. But let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row has the following columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, and pts (points). The claim mentions two specific aspects of a car: the chassis model \"brm p153\" and the engine type \"brm v12.\" Additionally, it refers to Jackie Oliver driving it twice.\n\nI need to check if there's an entry in the table where the entrant is Jackie Oliver, the chassis is BRM P153, and the engine is BRM V12. Also, I should see how many times this combination exists because the claim mentions \"2 time.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1967: Entrant is Lotus Components Ltd, not relevant.\n- 1968: Gold Leaf Team Lotus with chassis Lotus 49, not P153.\n- 1969: Owen Racing Organisation with BRM P133, P138, P139; all with BRM V12 engine but different chassis models.\n- 1970: Owen Racing Organisation and Yardley Team BRM both have BRM P153 and V12. So here's a match for the chassis and engine. However, who is the entrant? For 1970, Owen Racing Organisation and Yardley Team BRM are listed, neither of which is Jackie Oliver.\n- 1971: Mclaren M14a and M19a; not relevant.\n- 1972: Marlboro BRM P160b with V12 engine but different chassis.\n- 1973: Shadow DN1 with V8 engine; not matching the claim.\n- 1977: Shadow DN8 with V8; again, no match.\n\nSo from the table, in 1970, two teams used BRM P153 with V12 engines. Neither of them is Jackie Oliver. The claim mentions \"jackie oliver,\" which I think might be a typo or confusion with another name, perhaps John Oliver? Or maybe it's a specific person, but according to the table, no one named Jackie Oliver is listed as an entrant.\n\nAdditionally, the claim says \"2 time.\" Looking at the pts column for BRM P153 entries in 1970: both have 2 points. So if someone used that car twice and scored 2 points each time, it would sum to 4 total. But since no entry matches Jackie Oliver, this part isn't applicable here.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry in the table where Jackie Oliver is the entrant with BRM P153 and V12 engine. The claim doesn't seem to be supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions Jackie Oliver driving a BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine twice. However, reviewing the table shows that in 1970, two teams used the BRM P153 with V12 engines but neither was Jackie Oliver. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim that the time difference between Jackie Oliver's first and last race is 10 years is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Jackie Oliver is in this context. Looking at the \"entrant\" column, I see names like \"lotus components ltd,\" \"gold leaf team lotus,\" \"owen racing organisation,\" etc., but none of these are Jackie Oliver. That makes me think that either Jackie Oliver is not present in this table or perhaps I'm misunderstanding who Jackie Oliver refers to.\n\nWait, maybe \"Jackie Oliver\" is a typo and it's supposed to be another name? Alternatively, perhaps the term \"entrant\" refers to the team or driver associated with each entry. So, if I look for any entries where the entrant is Jackie Oliver, but there are none in this table. That suggests that the claim might not have evidence from the table.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1967: Entrant is \"lotus components ltd\"\n- 1968: \"gold leaf team lotus\"\n- 1969: \"owen racing organisation\"\n- 1970: \"yardley team brm\"\n- 1971: \"bruce mclaren motor racing\"\n- 1972: \"marlboro brm\"\n- 1973: \"uop shadow racing team\"\n- 1977: \"shadow racing team\"\n\nNone of these entrants are Jackie Oliver, which is a problem because if the claim is about Jackie's first and last races, we need his entries in the table. Without them, there's no way to calculate the time difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look at the years of first and last appearances of specific teams or something else? But the claim specifically mentions Jackie Oliver's races, which aren't present here.\n\nSo, since all the relevant information about entrants doesn't include Jackie Oliver, the claim can't be verified from this table.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and the data provided.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"jackie oliver\" having the most points with the \"gold leaf team auto.\" Looking at the table, I need to check for any entries related to these terms. However, when I look through the 'entrant' column, I don't see any mention of \"jackie oliver\" or \"gold leaf team auto.\" The closest matches are \"gold leaf team lotus\" in 1968 and another in 1969, but those aren't connected to Jackie Oliver.\n\nNext, I should consider if there's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe \"jackie oliver\" refers to someone else, like a team or a person associated with gold leaf teams. But based on the table provided, there's no direct link between Jackie Oliver and any points in the 'pts' column for the gold leaf teams.\n\nThe claim also states that they have \"the most point.\" To verify this, I need to look at all the 'pts' scores in the table. Let me list out the points from each row:\n\n- 1967: 0\n- 1968: 6 (gold leaf team lotus)\n- 1968: 6 (same team as above)\n- 1969: 1, 1, 1\n- 1970: 2, 2\n- 1971: 0, 0\n- 1972: 0\n- 1973: 4\n- 1977: 0\n\nThe highest points in the table are 6 from the gold leaf team lotus in 1968 and 4 from shadow racing team in 1973. Since Jackie Oliver isn't associated with these high points, it's clear that they didn't have the most points.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"gold leaf team auto,\" which doesn't appear in any of the 'entrant' columns provided. The closest is \"gold leaf team lotus\" but without any association to Jackie Oliver or \"auto.\"\n\nTherefore, after checking all relevant cells and comparing the claim against the table data, it's clear that the claim is false because there's no evidence of Jackie Oliver having the most points with the gold leaf team in the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"jackie oliver compete in over 15 race from 1967 - 1977\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Jackie Oliver competed in more than 15 races within the years 1967 to 1977. So, I need to check if there are at least 16 races in which Jackie Oliver was an entrant during those years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a specific entry with details like year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. My focus should be on the \"entrant\" column because that's where the drivers or teams are listed. The claim mentions Jackie Oliver, so I need to look for his name in the \"entrant\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table one by one:\n\n- 1967: Entrant is \"lotus components ltd.\" Not Jackie Oliver.\n- 1968: Entrant is \"gold leaf team lotus.\" Hmm, it's a team name, not specifically Jackie. Maybe he was part of this team? Or perhaps not. I'll need to see if any of the other entries list him directly.\n- 1969: Entrant is \"owen racing organisation.\" Different name, so probably not Jackie.\n- 1970: Entrant is \"yardley team brm.\" Again, a team, not Jackie.\n- 1971: Entrant is \"bruce mclaren motor racing.\" That's Bruce McLaren, not Jackie Oliver.\n- 1972: Entrant is \"marlboro brm.\" Marlboro BrM, likely the manufacturer, not Jackie.\n- 1973: Entrant is \"uop shadow racing team.\" UOP Shadow Team. Not Jackie.\n- 1977: Entrant is \"shadow racing team.\" Shadow Racing Team. Not Jackie.\n\nWait a minute, in all these rows, I don't see any mention of Jackie Oliver as the entrant. The claim says that he competed, so if his name isn't listed here, then perhaps the claim is false.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Could \"gold leaf team lotus\" be referring to him? Or another driver with a similar last name? I know that Jackie Stewart is another famous driver, but the claim is about Jackie Oliver. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- 1967: lotus components ltd\n- 1968: gold leaf team lotus (twice)\n- 1969: owen racing organisation (three times)\n- 1970: yardley team brm and owen racing organisation\n- 1971: bruce mclaren motor racing (twice)\n- 1972: marlboro brm\n- 1973: uop shadow racing team\n- 1977: shadow racing team\n\nNo Jackie Oliver here. So, if the claim is about Jackie competing in these races, but he isn't listed as an entrant in any of these rows, then the claim must be false.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for variations or perhaps it's a team name that includes his last name? Like \"Oliver\" might be part of a team name. But looking through the table, none of the entrants include \"Oliver.\" The closest is \"lotus,\" but that's just a model name.\n\nAlso, considering the time frame from 1967 to 1977, Jackie Oliver was active during those years, but if he didn't enter any races listed in this table, then he wasn't competing here. So, over 15 races in this specific dataset would not apply because he isn't present as an entrant.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are no entries for Jackie Oliver in the given table.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list Jackie Oliver as an entrant in any of the years from 1967 to 1977. Since the claim states that he competed in over 15 races during this period, and there's no evidence of his participation in the provided data, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

First, I should probably figure out who Jackie Oliver is and what their career spans are.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various racing teams, their chassis models, engines, and points over different years. The claim mentions Jackie Oliver's career spanning 15 years, so I'm looking for information about Jackie Oliver in this context.\n\nWait, the table lists entrants like \"lotus components ltd,\" \"gold leaf team lotus,\" \"owen racing organisation,\" \"bruce mclaren motor racing,\" etc. It doesn't mention anyone named Jackie Oliver. So that makes me think that maybe the claim is referring to someone not listed here, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding who Jackie Oliver is.\n\nI should double-check if Jackie Oliver is a real person and what his involvement in motorsport was. From my general knowledge, Jackie Stewart is a famous Formula 1 driver known as \"The Shadow,\" but he's also associated with other teams like Ferrari and Tyrrell. Wait, there's a team named Shadow Racing Team in the table. So perhaps that's relevant.\n\nLooking at the table again, under year 1973, there's an entry for \"shadow racing team\" with chassis Shadow DN1 and engine Cosworth V8, points 4. In 1977, another entry for \"shadow racing team\" with DN8 and V8, 0 points. But these are about the teams, not individuals.\n\nSo if the claim is about Jackie Oliver's career spanning 15 years, I need to see if any of the entries in the table relate to him. Since his name isn't listed as an entrant, perhaps this means that there's no information supporting a 15-year career in this table. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because it can't be verified from the data provided.\n\nBut wait, maybe Jackie Oliver is another name or a pseudonym for someone else? Or perhaps I'm confusing him with another person. If I can't find any entry for Jackie Oliver, then the information isn't present in the table to confirm or deny the claim about his career span.\n\nSo, based on that, since there's no data in the relevant cells regarding Jackie Oliver, the claim can't be fully supported by the given table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"jackie oliver 's last race be not with marlboro brm\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to suggest that Jackie Oliver's last race was not with Marlboro BRM. So I need to check if there is a record in the table where Jackie Oliver raced without Marlboro BRM as their entrant or team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. The key columns here are \"entrant\" and possibly others related to the team or sponsor.\n\nI need to check if there's any entry for Jackie Oliver in the \"entrant\" column. If there is, I'll look at which teams or sponsors they were associated with in their last race. Specifically, I'm looking to see if they ever raced without Marlboro BRM as their entrant or team.\n\nNow, scanning through the table:\n\n- 1967: Entrants include Lotus Components Ltd.\n- 1968: Gold Leaf Team Lotus twice.\n- 1969: Owen Racing Organisation three times.\n- 1970: Owen Racing Organisation and Yardley Team BRM.\n- 1971: Bruce McLaren Motor Racing twice.\n- 1972: Marlboro BRM once.\n- 1973: UOP Shadow Racing Team once.\n- 1977: Shadow Racing Team.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that in the table, the only times Jackie Oliver is mentioned as an entrant are under \"Owen Racing Organisation\" and \"Bruce McLaren Motor Racing.\" However, in 1972, it's Marlboro BRM. But I don't see any entries for Jackie Oliver directly in the table. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nHold on, perhaps Jackie Oliver is associated with other teams. For example, Owen Racing Organisation might have been associated with Marlboro in some capacity. Let me think about the possible connections.\n\nIn 1968, Gold Leaf Team Lotus had Marlboro as a sponsor. Similarly, later entries like Marlboro BRM and Shadow Racing Team with Cosworth V8 engines. But the claim specifically mentions Jackie Oliver's last race not being with Marlboro BRM.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing Jackie Oliver with other drivers or teams. Let me check if there's any mention of Jackie Oliver in the \"entrant\" column. Scanning again:\n\nLooking at each row's entrant:\n\n- 1967: Lotus Components Ltd.\n- 1968: Gold Leaf Team Lotus (twice)\n- 1969: Owen Racing Organisation (three times)\n- 1970: Owen Racing Organisation and Yardley Team BRM\n- 1971: Bruce McLaren Motor Racing (twice)\n- 1972: Marlboro BRM\n- 1973: UOP Shadow Racing Team\n- 1977: Shadow Racing Team\n\nI don't see Jackie Oliver listed as an entrant. Maybe I need to consider that the claim refers to a team associated with Jackie Oliver, like McLaren or Shadow. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about the sponsorship of his last race.\n\nWait, the claim says \"jackie oliver 's last race be not with marlboro brm.\" So, it's about whether in Jackie Oliver's last race, Marlboro BRM was not the entrant or sponsor.\n\nLooking at the table, I don't see any entries for Jackie Oliver himself. However, there is a Marlboro BRM entry in 1972. But since Jackie Oliver isn't listed as an entrant, perhaps he wasn't racing that year with them. Alternatively, his last race might have been with another team.\n\nWait, but without knowing when Jackie Oliver's last race was, it's hard to say. Maybe I should focus on the table data given and see if there's any row where Marlboro BRM is listed as the entrant in a year after 1972, or if Jackie Oliver was associated with them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the sponsorship rather than the entrant. For example, maybe his car had Marlboro branding but wasn't entered by Marlboro BRM.\n\nBut considering the table's structure, the \"entrant\" column is crucial. Since there are no rows where Jackie Oliver is listed as the entrant, I might need to consider that the claim is incorrect because he never raced with Marlboro BRM in his last race, or perhaps he did, but it's not reflected here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The table lists entrants for various races, and Jackie Oliver isn't listed as an entrant in any of these rows. So if the claim is that his last race was without Marlboro BRM, but since he wasn't racing with them according to the table, the claim could be TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't list all possible races or entrants, so it's unclear.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread. The claim says \"jackie oliver 's last race be not with marlboro brm.\" So, if in his last race, he wasn't with Marlboro BRM, then the statement is TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, the last row is 1977, which is Shadow Racing Team. But Jackie Oliver isn't listed as an entrant anywhere, so maybe his last race isn't even in this table.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe Jackie Oliver was involved with Marlboro BRM in a later year not listed here. Or perhaps the claim refers to sponsorship rather than entrants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes all relevant races up until 1977, and after that, Jackie Oliver didn't race anymore, so his last race is before 1977.\n\nBut without knowing exactly when Jackie Oliver's last race was, it's hard to verify. However, based on the table provided, there's no entry for Jackie Oliver as an entrant, and Marlboro BRM appears only in 1972. So if his last race was after 1972, he wasn't with them, making the claim TRUE.\n\nWait, but since there's no data about Jackie Oliver racing in any of these years, perhaps the claim is incorrect because he didn't have a last race with Marlboro BRM, so it's FALSE.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for any association between Jackie Oliver and Marlboro BRM in the table.\n\nLooking again: In 1972, entrant is Marlboro BRM, but no driver name is provided. So perhaps the table only lists team names, not drivers. Therefore, without knowing if Jackie Oliver was associated with Marlboro BRM in his last race, it's hard to verify.\n\nBut since the claim says that his last race was NOT with them, and if there's no data indicating he raced with them, then maybe it's TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table shows that he did race with them in 1972, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but 1972 is a year when Marlboro BRM had an entry. If Jackie Oliver was racing that year with them, his last race would have been with them, making the claim FALSE. Otherwise, if his last race was before or after, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I might lean towards the claim being TRUE because there's no evidence in the table that he raced with Marlboro BRM in any of these years, including 1972. So perhaps his last race was earlier, without them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jackie Oliver's last race was not with Marlboro BRM. Based on the provided data:\n\n- There is no entry for Jackie Oliver as an entrant in the table, which includes races from at least 1967 to 1977.\n- Marlboro BRM appears only in the 1972 row, but without a specific driver mentioned.\n  \nSince there's no indication that Jackie Oliver raced with Marlboro BRM during these years, it suggests his last race might have occurred before or after this timeframe. Therefore, the claim is considered **TRUE** as there's no evidence in the table that he raced with them.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is considered true based on the provided data.",

Wait, but the claim says Jackie Oliver, and I don't see any row where the entrant is Jackie Oliver.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again, the only rows with BRM P153 and V12 engines are in 1970: Owen Racing Organisation, chassis p153, engine v12, pts 2. There's also a 1970 entry for Yardley Team BRM, same chassis and engine, points 2.\n\nBut none of these entries have Jackie Oliver as the entrant.

Let me double-check:\n\nIn 1970, both entries are Owen Racing Organisation and Yardley Team BRM. The claim refers to \"Jackie Oliver always drive,\" so if Jackie is the entrant in any row, that would support it. But since none of the rows have his name, the claim isn't supported.\n\nAdditionally, even if there was an entry for Jackie Oliver, unless both the chassis and engine match, the claim wouldn't be fully supported. Since neither condition is met for any relevant row, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Jackie Oliver always drive a BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine\" is not supported by the table data because no entry in the table lists Jackie Oliver as the entrant, nor does it have both the BRM P153 chassis and BRM V12 engine together. \n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Jackie Oliver's last race was with Lotus Component Ltd.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. Jackie Oliver is a racing driver, and the claim refers to his last race. So I need to find out if he ever raced with Lotus Components Ltd. The table lists various entrants, their chassis, engines, and points for different years.\n\nLooking at the table, I see entries from 1967 to 1977. The relevant columns are 'entrant', 'chassis', 'engine', and 'pts'. My main focus should be on the 'entrant' column because that's where the teams or organizations are listed.\n\nI need to check if Jackie Oliver was an entrant in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1967: Entrants are Lotus Components Ltd, Gold Leaf Team Lotus (twice), etc.\n- 1968: Gold Leaf Team Lotus again, and others.\n- 1969: Owen Racing Organisation.\n- 1970: Yardley Team BRM.\n- 1971: Bruce Mclaren Motor Racing.\n- 1972: Marlboro BRM.\n- 1973: UOP Shadow Racing Team.\n- 1977: Shadow Racing Team.\n\nI don't see Jackie Oliver listed as an entrant in any of these rows. So that suggests he wasn't part of the teams listed here. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about his last race, not necessarily that he was an entrant himself.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to which team he raced for in his last race. So if I can find Jackie Oliver's last race and see if it was with Lotus Components Ltd, that would be key.\n\nLooking up outside the table (but within my knowledge), Jackie Oliver did race for teams like McLaren, Shadow, and others. But I don't recall him racing for Lotus Component Ltd in his later years. His last Formula 1 race was with the Shadow team in 1976, which is after the period covered by this table.\n\nWait, but the table goes up to 1977. Let me check if there's any entry where Jackie Oliver was associated as an entrant or driver for Lotus Components Ltd. From the table provided, I don't see his name listed. The entrants are mostly teams like Lotus, BRM, McLaren, Shadow, etc., but not specifically mentioning Jackie Oliver.\n\nSo the claim might be false because there's no evidence in this table that Jackie Oliver raced with Lotus Component Ltd as his last race. Alternatively, if he did, it would have to be mentioned under 'entrant' or 'driver', which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding 'entrant'. An entrant is a team, not necessarily the driver. So even if the table doesn't list Jackie Oliver as an entrant, he could have been part of one of these teams. But looking at the years, his last race in Formula 1 was with Shadow Racing Team in 1976, which isn't listed here, but the table goes up to 1977, so maybe there's a connection.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim is about Jackie Oliver's last race being with Lotus Component Ltd. From what I know, his last race wasn't with that team. So even if this table doesn't list him as an entrant, the claim would still be false because he didn't end his career with them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes all relevant races, so if Jackie Oliver's last race is within this table and with Lotus Component Ltd, then it would be true. But looking at the years in the table, up to 1977, but I think Jackie Oliver's last race was before that or after. Wait, no, he retired in 1981, so this table only covers up to 1977, which is earlier than his actual retirement.\n\nWait, maybe in the context of this table, the latest year is 1977, so if his last race within that period was with Lotus Component Ltd, then it would be true. But looking at the table, I don't see Jackie Oliver as an entrant. The team Lotus Components Ltd is listed in 1967, but not associated with him.\n\nSo, based on this, there's no entry where Jackie Oliver was an entrant or driver for Lotus Component Ltd in his last race within the years covered here. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Jackie Oliver's last race as per the given table doesn't list him racing with Lotus Component Ltd.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
