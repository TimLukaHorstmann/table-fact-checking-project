    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"25.7 million international tourist visits Russia in 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are rank, country, unwto region, international tourist arrivals for 2012, 2011, and the changes between those years. So each row represents a country with specific data.\n\nThe claim is about Russia having 25.7 million visitors in 2012. Looking through the table, I need to find the row where the country is Russia and check the 2012 arrivals column.\n\nScrolling down the table, I see that there's a row for Russia at rank 9. The data under \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" for Russia is indeed 25.7 million. So this matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The column headers are clear: 2012 is directly listed for Russia as 25.7 million. There's no discrepancy in numbers or any other factors that might affect this. The change columns refer to how the numbers changed from 2011 to 2012 and before, but those don't impact the actual number of arrivals in 2012.\n\nTherefore, since the table confirms that Russia had 25.7 million international tourist visits in 2012, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches exactly with the data in the table for Russia's 2012 arrivals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"In the UNWTO region of Asia, 57.7 million international tourist arrivals (2012) were less than in 2011.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. There's a column called \"unwto region,\" so that's important. The claim mentions the region is Asia, so I need to find rows where the unwto region is Asia.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Europe\n- Row 2: North America\n- Row 3: Asia\n- Row 4: Europe\n- And so on.\n\nSo only row 3 is in Asia. Now, looking at that row (row 3), I need to find the international tourist arrivals for 2012 and 2011.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- In 2012, it's 57.7 million.\n- In 2011, it was 57.6 million.\n\nSo comparing these two numbers: 57.7 million is more than 57.6 million. That means in 2012, there were actually more arrivals than in 2011 in Asia. \n\nWait, but the claim says it's less. So that would make the claim false because the number increased from 2011 to 2012.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row is 3 (since it's zero-indexed as per the example), and the columns involved are \"unwto region\" to check the region, \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" to see the number for that year, and \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\" to compare with.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 3, column: unwto region\n- Row 3, column: international tourist arrivals (2012)\n- Row 3, column: international tourist arrivals (2011)\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the claim is incorrect. The numbers show an increase, not a decrease.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in Asia, international tourist arrivals increased from 57.6 million in 2011 to 57.7 million in 2012. Relevant cells are row 3 for region, arrivals in 2012, and arrivals in 2011.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"unwto region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" },\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
