    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says, \"Tyreke Evans scored the most points on November 6 when he scored 30 points.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each step. Let me break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: that Tyreke Evans scored the most points on November 6 and that he scored 30 points in that game. So I need to verify both parts from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with several columns like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to November 6. Scanning through the dates: row 4 is Nov 1, row5 is Nov3, row6 is Nov6, row7 is Nov10. So only row6 is on November 6.\n\nIn row6 (November6), the game against Memphis resulted in a loss with a score of w 91-100 (ot). The high points are listed as Tyreke Evans scoring 30 points.\n\nSo the first part of the claim says he scored the most points that day. Since it's the only game on November6, I need to check if he indeed had the highest points in that game. From the table, his score is 30, and there are no other high point values for that row. So yes, he had the most points.\n\nThe second part of the claim says he scored 30 points. Looking at the same row6, under 'high points' it's Tyreke Evans (30). That matches, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but the column is called 'high points,' which might imply he was the highest scorer in that game. Since it's the only game on November6, and there are no other high point entries for that date, this is accurate.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by row6, columns: 'date' (row_index 6), 'high points'. So the relevant cells would be row6 and the 'high points' column.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any conflicting information in other rows for November6, so this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"tyreke evans score more than 30 point on november 5 in an epic game.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each relevant cell related to Tyreke Evans and his scoring. I'm particularly interested in games where he scored 30+ points.\n\nLooking through the table, the row index corresponds to each game number. For example:\n- Row 4: November 1, Toronto\n- Row 5: November 3, LA Lakers\n- Row 6: November 6, Memphis\n- And so on.\n\nI need to find a game where Tyreke Evans scored over 30 points on November 5. Let me scan the dates:\n\nRow 4: Nov 1\nRow 5: Nov 3\nRow 6: Nov 6\nRow 7: Nov 10\nRow 8: Nov 12\nRow 9: Nov 14\nRow 10: Nov 17\nRow 11: Nov 19\nRow 12: Nov 21\nRow 13: Nov 22\nRow 14: Nov 25\nRow 15: Nov 27\n\nWait, I don't see a game on November 5. The closest dates are November 3 (Row 5) and November 6 (Row 6). So there's no game on November 5 in the table.\n\nLooking at the scores:\n- Row 4: 23 points\n- Row 5: 21 points\n- Row 6: 30 points\n\nAh, wait a minute. On Row 6, which is November 6, Tyreke Evans scored 30 points. That's more than 30, but it's not on November 5.\n\nSo the claim mentions November 5, but there's no game that day in the table. Therefore, even though he did score 30 on another date close to November 5, the exact date doesn't match. Hence, the claim is false because there's no game on November 5 where he scored more than 30 points.\n\nAdditionally, I should check other relevant cells for Tyreke Evans' scoring in the games listed. For example:\n- Row 4: 23 pts\n- Row 5: 21 pts\n- Row 6: 30 pts (Nov 6)\n- Row 7: He scored 17 points.\n- And so on.\n\nBut since there's no November 5 game, that part of the claim isn't supported. So I don't need to check other cells beyond confirming the date and score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there's no game on November 5 in the table where Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
