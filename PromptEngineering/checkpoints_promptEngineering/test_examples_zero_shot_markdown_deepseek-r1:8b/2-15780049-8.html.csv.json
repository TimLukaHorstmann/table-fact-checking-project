    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"vince carter and hakeem olajuwon be the high rebounders in game 62 against houston.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table. Let me break down the claim into key points:\n\n1. **Players involved**: Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon.\n2. **Game number**: Game 62.\n3. **Opponent**: Houston.\n4. **Stat to check**: High rebounds.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table to find Game 62. Scanning through the row numbers, I see that Game 62 is on March 5 against Houston with a score of l 109 - 112 (ot). \n\nNow, I need to find the high rebounders for this game. Looking at the \"high rebounds\" column for Game 62, it says \"vince carter , hakeem olajuwon (7)\". So both players are listed as the top rebounders with a total of 7 rebounds.\n\nThe claim mentions both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon as high rebounders. According to the table, this is accurate because they are both listed together in that game's high rebounds. There's no conflicting information elsewhere that would negate this.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with the given data in Game 62 against Houston where both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon are recorded as the high rebounders.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"orlando win game 65 with a score of 79 - 92\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim. It says that Orlando won Game 65 with a score of 79-92. So, I should look for Game 65 in the table and check if it's an Orlando game, what their score was, whether they won, and if the opposing team's score aligns.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The \"game\" column has numbers from 60 to 73. I'm looking for Game 65.\n\nIn the table, Row 70 is labeled as Game 70? Wait no, let me check again. No, actually, each row corresponds to a specific game number. Let's see:\n\n- Game 60: Portland\n- Game 61: Philadelphia\n- ...\n- Game 65: Orlando\n\nYes, in the table, Game 65 is for Orlando on March 10.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column for Game 65, it says l 79 - 92 (ot). The 'l' likely stands for loss. So Orlando lost that game, not won.\n\nThe claim states they won, which contradicts this. Therefore, the score part doesn't match either. They lost with a score of 79-92.\n\nAdditionally, to make sure, I should check if it's Game 65 and if the opponents are correct. But since the claim is about Orlando winning, but according to the table they lost that game, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim says: \"On March 10, Vince Carter (43) has high points and Alvin Williams (9) has high assists.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see which one corresponds to March 10. Scanning the 'date' column, I see that row 65 is on March 10. \n\nNow, focusing on row 65: game 65 occurred on March 10 against Orlando. The high points for this game are listed as Vince Carter with 16 points. Wait, but in the claim, it says Vince Carter scored 43 points. That doesn't match. So that part is false.\n\nNext, checking the assists column for row 65: Alvin Williams has 4 assists. But the claim states he had 9 assists. That's also incorrect.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me double-check. For game 65 on March 10, high points are Vince Carter (16), and high rebounds include Antonio Davis and Jerome Williams (12). High assists are Chris Childs with 7. So Alvin Williams didn't have any assists that day.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect: Carter didn't score 43 points, and Williams didn't assist 9 times. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to identify which columns are used in checking this. The claim mentions high points and high assists, so I need to look at the 'high points' and 'high assists' columns for that specific row (65).\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For game 65, row index is 65.\n- Columns: 'high points' and 'high assists'.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" with these two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because on March 10, Vince Carter scored 16 points and Alvin Williams had only 4 assists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about a specific basketball game is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"game number 72 on march 28 be against cleveland with a score of w 94 - 80 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim to check against the table. The key points here are game number, date, opposing team, and the score.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: game, date, team, score, high points, etc. Each row represents a different game, so I need to find the row that corresponds to game 72 on March 28 against Cleveland with a score of W 94-80 (OT).\n\nStarting with the game number: The table lists games from 60 onwards. Game 72 would be somewhere in this range. Let's look at each row:\n\nRow 60: Game 60, March 1 vs Portland\nRow 61: Game 61, March 3 vs Philadelphia\n...\nContinuing until I reach game 72.\n\nWait, the table only goes up to game 73. So game 72 is indeed present.\n\nLooking for game 72, which is on March 28 against Atlanta with a score of W 85-83 (OT). The claim states it's against Cleveland with a different score.\n\nSo that immediately suggests a discrepancy. The team in the table for game 72 is Atlanta, not Cleveland. Therefore, the claim is false because the opposing team doesn't match.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check other aspects as well. \n\nNext, the score: The claim says W 94-80 (OT). In the table, game 72's score is listed as w 85 -83 (ot). So the scores don't match either. Therefore, even if the team was Cleveland, the score would still be incorrect.\n\nBut since both the team and the score are different, the claim is clearly false. There might be confusion between game numbers or dates, but based on the exact information provided in the table, it doesn't align with the claim.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" because none of the relevant cells match all the criteria given in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
