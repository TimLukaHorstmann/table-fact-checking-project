    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the golden state game be play at the at&t center 18581 people attend.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions a game involving \"golden state\" which likely refers to the Golden State Warriors team. The location is \"at&t center,\" and the attendance is 18581.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row where both \"team\" is Golden State Warriors and the location is AT&T Center with attendance 18581.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n- Row 67: Team is Golden State, location is AT&T Center, attendance is 18581. That seems to match exactly.\n  \nWait, but let me check all rows to make sure there's no other Golden State game at AT&T Center with that attendance.\n\nRow 58-73 are for games from March 1 to March 29. Only row 67 has the team as \"golden state\" and location as \"at&t center\" with 18581 attendance.\n\nSo, since this specific game is present in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns involved are:\n\n- game (row index)\n- date\n- team\n- score\n- high points, etc., but not needed here.\n- location and attendance.\n\nSo, for row 67, the columns are \"game,\" \"team,\" \"location attendance.\"\n\nWait, looking at the table structure, \"location attendance\" is a single column. So in the JSON response, I need to indicate which cells (row index and column name) correspond to verifying this claim.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include:\n\n- row 67, columns: team, location attendance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game number for cleveland be 71\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. Each row represents a specific game with these details.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Cleveland playing in Game 71. So, my task is to find out if there's a row where the 'team' column is \"Cleveland\" and the 'game' number is 71.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for Game 71. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 58: Game 58, New Orleans team.\nRow 59: Game 59, New Orleans.\nRow 60: Game 60, Memphis.\nRow 61: Game 61, Cleveland. Wait, here's a Cleveland game at row 61 with game number 61.\n\nBut the claim is about Game 71 for Cleveland. So I need to check if there's a row where 'game' is 71 and 'team' is Cleveland.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 62: New York.\n63: Minnesota.\n64: Clippers.\n65: Miami.\n66: Orlando.\n67: Golden State.\n68: Atlanta.\n69: Oklahoma City.\n70: Lakers.\n71: March 26, Cleveland. Oh, here it is! So Game 71 is indeed a Cleveland game.\n\nNow, looking at the details:\n\nIn row 71, the 'game' number is 71 and the 'team' is \"cleveland\". The score is a win with 102-97 in OT. High points by Manu Ginobili with 30. That matches.\n\nSo, all conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 71 where the game number is 71 and the team is Cleveland.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about different games played by some teams, including details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"the golden state game and the oklahoma game be both play at the at&t center with over 19000 in attendance.\" My task is to verify this by checking the relevant cells in the table. The instructions tell me to list which rows and columns are relevant to support or refute the claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two games: one played by the Golden State team and another by Oklahoma. Both these games were supposed to be held at the AT&T Center with attendance exceeding 19,000 people.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific game, identified by numbers like 58, 59, etc. Each column represents different attributes of each game. The relevant columns here are \"game\" (to identify which team played), \"location attendance,\" and maybe others, but location is key for the AT&T Center.\n\nSo, I'll start by identifying which rows correspond to games played by Golden State and Oklahoma.\n\nStarting with the \"game\" column, I need to find rows where the team is either \"golden state\" or \"oklahoma city.\" Let's go through each row:\n\n- Game 67: Golden State\n- Game 69: Oklahoma City\n\nThese are the two relevant rows for the claim. \n\nNext, I check the location attendance for these games. For game 67, the attendance was at AT&T Center with 18,581 people. For game 69, it's also listed as AT&T Center but with 18,203 attendees.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"over 19,000 in attendance.\" Both attendances are under that threshold\u201418,581 and 18,203. So, both games had less than 19,000 people attending.\n\nThis means the claim is incorrect because it states that both games were played at AT&T Center with over 19,000 attendees, but according to the table, neither reached that number.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells are the ones for game 67 (Golden State) and game 69 (Oklahoma City), specifically looking at the attendance column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n]}",
