    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is about the opponent named jeremija sander having a record of 8-2.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through the table to find the row where the opponent's name is jeremija sanders. Scanning each row's \"opponent\" column... Let me see: jorge santiago, josh burkman, mike bronzoulis, eric davila, kazuhiro nakamura, anthony ruiz, james head, maiquel falc\u00e3o, david branch, mario miranda, john salter, nissen osterneck, david knight, travis doerge, jay ford, mitch whitesel, brandon mcdowell, jeremija sanders... Ah, here's the row for jeremija sanders.\n\nNow, looking at that row, the \"record\" column shows 8-2. That matches exactly with the claim given. So, the record of opponent jeremija sander is indeed 8-2 according to the table.\n\nI should also note down which cells are relevant. The \"row_index\" for this entry is... Let me count starting from 0: before that row (the first entry with jorge santiago) is index 0, so the next few rows after that would be increasing. Let's see, counting each line:\n\n1. win | 22 -5\n2. loss |21-5\n3. win |21-4\n4. win |20-4\n5. win |19-4\n6. win |18-4\n7. win |17-4 (Wait, no, the opponent names go up to jay ford, then mitch whitesel, brandon mcdowell, then jeremija sanders.\n\nSo after counting each row:\n\n1. Row 0: jorge santiago\n2. Row 1: josh burkman\n3. Row 2: mike bronzoulis\n4. Row 3: eric davila\n5. Row 4: kazuhiro nakamura\n6. Row 5: anthony ruiz\n7. Row 6: james head\n8. Row 7: maiquel falc\u00e3o\n9. Row 8: david branch\n10. Row 9: mario miranda\n11. Row 10: john salter\n12. Row 11: nissen osterneck\n13. Row 12: david knight\n14. Row 13: travis doerge\n15. Row 14: jay ford\n16. Row 15: mitch whitesel\n17. Row 16: brandon mcdowell\n18. Row 17: jeremija sanders\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the table provided has more entries. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table as presented:\n\n- The first entry is for jorge santiago (opponent), row index 0.\n- Then each subsequent opponent increases the row index by 1.\n\nSo the row where jeremija sanders appears is... Let's see: after brandon mcdowell, which is row 16, comes jeremija sanders as row 17. So in that row, \"record\" is 8-2 and \"opponent\" is jeremija sanders.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are \"row_index\":17 and \"column_name\":\"record\". Also, we need to check if \"opponent\" is correctly listed as jeremija sander (note: the claim uses \"sander\" with one 'r', but the table has \"sandlers\"? Wait, looking at the table:\n\nLooking at the last few rows:\n\n17. win | 8 - 0    | curtis stout\n18. win |7 -0     | travis fowler\n19. win |5 -0     | harvell hunter\n20. win |4 -0     | bubba mcdaniel\n21. win |3 -0     | joe bunch\n22. win |2 -0     | chester lauchner\n23. win |1 -0     | ryan lopez\n\nWait, no, the entry for jeremija sanders is at row 17? Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount each row:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: jorge santiago\nRow 1: josh burkman\nRow 2: mike bronzoulis\nRow3: eric davila\nRow4: kazuhiro nakamura\nRow5: anthony ruiz\nRow6: james head\nRow7: maiquel falc\u00e3o\nRow8: david branch\nRow9: mario miranda\nRow10: john salter\nRow11: nissen osterneck\nRow12: david knight\nRow13: travis doerge\nRow14: jay ford\nRow15: mitch whitesel\nRow16: brandon mcdowell\nRow17: jeremija sanders\nRow18: loss |7 -2 | benji radach\nRow19: loss |7-1| fabio leopoldo\nRow20: win |7-0| curtis stout\nRow21: win |6-0| travis fowler\nRow22: win |5-0| harvell hunter\nRow23: win |4-0| bubba mcdaniel\nRow24: win |3-0| joe bunch\nRow25: win |2-0| chester lauchner\nRow26: win |1-0| ryan lopez\n\nSo yes, jeremija sanders is at row 17. Therefore, the \"record\" in that row is 8-2.\n\nSo, the claim says the record is 8-2 for opponent jeremija sander, and according to the table, that's exactly what it shows.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":17, \"column_name\":\"record\"}]}",

The claim says: \"the record of jeremija sanders' opponent be 8 - 4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided to find any entries related to \"jeremija sanders.\" Scanning each row, I spot that in row number 9 (since markdown tables start counting from 1) the opponent is \"jeremija sanders.\" \n\nLooking at row 9: it shows a win for someone with a record of 8-2 against jeremija sanders. The method was a tko (punches), and the event was ftp: global showdown in Thackerville, Oklahoma.\n\nNow, the claim mentions that the opponent's record is 8-4. But from the table, the opponent in this case had an 8-2 record when fighting jeremija sanders. There's no other row where \"jeremija sanders\" appears as the opponent, so this is the only relevant entry.\n\nSince the actual record is 8-2 and not 8-4, the claim doesn't hold true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jeremija Sanders' opponent had a record of 8-4. However, checking the table, the only relevant row shows an opponent with an 8-2 record. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
