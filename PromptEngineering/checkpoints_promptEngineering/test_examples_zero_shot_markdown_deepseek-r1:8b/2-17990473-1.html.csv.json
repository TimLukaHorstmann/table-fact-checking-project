    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"when the result be w 27 - 21 the attendance be 70012 and opponent oakland raider.\" So, the claim is making two specific statements related to a particular game in the table. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll try to find any rows where the result is a win with the score 27-21, attendance is 70,012, and the opponent is the Oakland Raiders.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's \"result\" column to see if there's a 'w 27 - 21' outcome. Let me go through each week one by one:\n\nWeek 1: Result is l 38-21 \u2013 not a win.\nWeek 2: l 26-10 \u2013 loss.\nWeek 3: l 13-10 \u2013 loss.\nWeek 4: l 21-13 \u2013 loss.\nWeek 5: w 16-13 \u2013 different score.\nWeek 6: w 31-10 \u2013 different score.\nWeek 7: l 24-23 \u2013 loss.\nWeek 8: l 23-20 \u2013 loss.\nWeek 9: w 33-17 \u2013 different score.\nWeek 10: l 20-17 \u2013 loss.\nWeek 11: w 27-21 \u2013 here we go, this matches the result part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the attendance for week 11. The table shows attendance as 70012. That's a match for the claim's \"attendance be 70012\" part.\n\nNext, who was the opponent in week 11? Looking at the \"opponent\" column, it says Oakland Raiders. So that matches too.\n\nWait, but there's something odd. I see weeks are numbered from 1 to 17, and the claim doesn't specify which week this is referring to. However, based on the result being w27-21, we found week 11 as the correct row. \n\nSo all the elements of the claim\u2014result, attendance, and opponent\u2014are present in week 11's data. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n\nBut wait another thing: sometimes, there might be multiple entries for a result like w27-21. Let me check if any other weeks have that same result. From the table provided, it seems only week 11 has w27-21. So no duplication here.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied in week 11. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a game with a specific result, attendance, and opponent. Checking each row, week 11 matches all criteria: result 'w 27 - 21', attendance 70012, and opponent Oakland Raiders.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the san diego charger be an opponent on november 7 , 1999 with the result w 33 - 17.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need to be verified against the table. The key components here are:\n\n1. Opponent: San Diego Chargers\n2. Date: November 7, 1999\n3. Result: W (win) 33 - 17\n\nNow, looking at the table structure, it has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different game.\n\nI need to check if there's a row where:\n\n- The opponent is San Diego Chargers.\n- The date is November 7, 1999.\n- The result is a win with the score 33 - 17.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row in the table and see which cells match these criteria.\n\nStarting from week 1 to week 17. Let's look for San Diego Chargers as the opponent on November 7, 1999.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Week 9: November 7, 1999 vs San Diego Chargers, result W 33 - 17.\n\nThat matches exactly with all three criteria: opponent is San Diego Chargers, date is November 7, and the result is a win with the score 33-17.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE. But I also need to identify which cells in the table are relevant.\n\nRelevant columns for this check would be:\n\n- Opponent column (to confirm the team)\n- Date column (to confirm the date)\n- Result column (to confirm the outcome)\n\nSo, the relevant_cells will include the row index and the corresponding column name. Since week 9 is November 7, that's row_index 8 (since counting starts from 0). So:\n\nOpponent: San Diego Chargers \u2192 row 8, column \"opponent\"\nDate: November 7, 1999 \u2192 row 8, column \"date\"\nResult: W 33 - 17 \u2192 row 8, column \"result\"\n\nI think that's all. I don't need to check attendance unless the claim includes it, which it doesn't. So, only these three cells are relevant.\n\nWait, let me double-check the week numbering. The first week is week 1, so week 9 would be row index 8 (since 1-17). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be TRUE and the relevant cells are as mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's in markdown format with several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nI need to find the specific row corresponding to January 2, 2000. Scanning through the dates:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1999\n- Week 2: September 19, 1999\n- Week 3: September 26, 1999\n- Week 4: October 3, 1999\n- Week 5: October 10, 1999\n- Week 6: October 17, 1999\n- Week 7: October 24, 1999\n- Week 8: October 31, 1999\n- Week 9: November 7, 1999\n- Week 10: November 14, 1999\n- Week 11: November 22, 1999\n- Week 13: December 5, 1999\n- Week 14: December 13, 1999\n- Week 15: December 19, 1999\n- Week 16: December 25, 1999\n- Week 17: January 2, 2000\n\nSo, week 17 is the one on January 2, 2000. \n\nLooking at the result column for week 17, it shows \"l 12 - 6\". That matches the result part of the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check the attendance figure. The table lists attendance as 69278 for week 17. \n\nSince both the date, result, and attendance figures in the claim match exactly with the data in the table, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's attendance figure and result are both verified in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim says: \"in week 12 there be no game while in week 13 the game be against opponent kansas city chief.\" So, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Whether there was no game played in week 12.\n2. Whether in week 13, the game was indeed against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nTo do this, I'll look at the table provided. The table lists games from week 1 to week 17, with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance for each week. \n\nStarting with week 12: Looking through the table, the weeks go up to 17, but let's check if there's a game in week 12. Scanning the row numbers, I see that after week 11 comes week 13, which suggests there might not be a week 12 entry. Let me confirm:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1999\n- Week 2: September 19, 1999\n- ...\n- Week 11: November 22, 1999\n- Week 13: December 5, 1999\n\nYes, there's no entry for week 12.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the week 4 game have an attendance of 74181 and be played on October 3, 1999.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is that in week 4, the attendance was 74,181. The second part is that this game took place on October 3, 1999.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the relevant rows and columns that correspond to these conditions. Let me start by identifying which row corresponds to week 4. \n\nThe table lists each week from 1 to 17. Week 4 is when the opponent was the New York Jets, and the result was a loss with the score 21-13. The date for week 4 is October 3, 1999. The attendance column shows 74,181 for that week.\n\nSo, for the first part of the claim, checking the attendance: I need to find where week 4 is in the table. Looking at the table, row number 4 (since it starts from 1) corresponds to week 4. In this row, under the \"attendance\" column, the value is indeed 74181.\n\nNext, for the second part of the claim about the date: I need to confirm that week 4 took place on October 3, 1999. Looking at the same row (row 4), the date is listed as October 3, 1999. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are met. The attendance was 74181 and the game was played on October 3, 1999 during week 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out correctly for both parts. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the attendance on january 2 , 2000 be not 69278 for a game that have a result of i 12 - 6.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The claim mentions an attendance figure and a specific game result. So I need to look at the table to find the relevant cells.\n\nLooking at the table columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance. So the relevant columns are 'date' and 'attendance', but more specifically, since the claim refers to January 2, 2000, that's a specific date. So I need to check if there's an entry for that date in the table.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one with the date January 2, 2000. Scanning the 'date' column:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1999\n- Week 2: September 19, 1999\n- ...\n- Week 17: January 2, 2000.\n\nYes, week 17 has the date January 2, 2000. Now, what about the attendance? The claim says the attendance was not 69278 for that game. So I check the 'attendance' column for week 17.\n\nLooking at row 17 (since weeks start at 1), but wait, in the table provided, week 17 is the last one. Let me count:\n\n- Week 1: ...\n- Week 2: ...\n- ...\n- Week 17: January 2, 2000 with attendance 69278.\n\nWait, that's a problem because according to the claim, it should not be 69278. But in the table, for week 17, the attendance is exactly 69278.\n\nSo the claim says the attendance was not 69278. However, the table shows that it was indeed 69278. That means the claim is false because the attendance on January 2, 2000 was 69278.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the table data. Sometimes tables can have misalignments or errors in numbering weeks. Wait, looking back at the provided table:\n\nWeeks go from 1 to 17, with week 13 and 14 continuing after November, so December and then January 2, which is week 17.\n\nIn week 17, the result is 'l 12 - 6' (loss) and attendance is 69278. So yes, that matches exactly what the claim refers to.\n\nBut the claim says \"the attendance on january 2 , 2000 be not 69278\". Since it's actually 69278, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe attendance for January 2, 2000, as recorded in week 17 of the table, is indeed 69,278. Therefore, the claim that the attendance was not 69,278 is incorrect.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim is: \"when the result be w 27 - 21 the attendance be 70012 and opponent oakland raider.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to be saying that there was a game where the result was a win (denoted by 'w') with scores 27 - 21. The attendance at that game was 70,012, and the opponent was the Oakland Raiders.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any row where all these conditions match: result is 'w 27 - 21', attendance is 70012, and opponent is Oakland Raiders.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to check for these conditions. Let's list out the details:\n\n1. Week 1: Opponent Miami Dolphins, Result L 38-21\n2. Week 2: Opponent Kansas City Chiefs, Result L 26-10\n3. Week 3: Opponent Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Result L 13-10\n4. Week 4: Opponent New York Jets, Result L 21-13\n5. Week 5: Opponent Oakland Raiders, Result W 16-13\n6. Week 6: Opponent Green Bay Packers, Result W 31-10\n7.

Week 17: Opponent San Diego Chargers, Result L 12-6\n\nNow, let's focus on the claim. The result is 'w 27 - 21'. Looking at the table, which weeks have a win with that exact score? Checking each week:\n\n- Week 5: Raiders, W16-13 (Not 27-21)\n- Week 6: Packers, W31-10 (No)\n- Week 9: Chargers, W33-17 (No)\n- Week 11: Raiders, W27-21 (Yes, this matches the result)\n\nWeek 11 is where the opponent was Oakland Raiders and the result was a win by 27-21. Now check the attendance for Week 11.\n\nLooking at the table, week 11 has an attendance of 70012. That's exactly what the claim states.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the san diego charger be an opponent on november 6 , 1999 with the result w 17 - 33.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two things: the opponent's name and the date of the game, as well as the result. So I need to check if San Diego Chargers were indeed opponents on November 6, 1999, and what the result was.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists each week with details like the date, opponent, result, and attendance. My task is to find the relevant cells that correspond to the claim's components.\n\nLet me go through the table row by row:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1999 vs Miami Dolphins, Result: L 38-21\n- Week 2: September 19, 1999 vs Kansas City Chiefs, Result: L 26-10\n- Week 3: September 26, 1999 vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Result: L 13-10\n- Week 4: October 3, 1999 vs New York Jets, Result: L 21-13\n- Week 5: October 10, 1999 vs Oakland Raiders, Result: W 16-13\n- Week 6: October 17, 1999 vs Green Bay Packers, Result: W 31-10\n- Week 7: October 24, 1999 vs New England Patriots, Result: L 24-23\n- Week 8: October 31, 1999 vs Minnesota Vikings, Result: L 23-20\n- Week 9: November 7, 1999 vs San Diego Chargers, Result: W 33-17\n- Week 10: November 14, 1999 vs Seattle Seahawks, Result: L 20-17\n- Week 11: November 22, 1999 vs Oakland Raiders, Result: W 27-21\n- Week 13: December 5, 1999 vs Kansas City Chiefs, Result: L 16-10\n- Week 14: December 13, 1999 vs Jacksonville Jaguars, Result: L 27-24\n- Week 15: December 19, 1999 vs Seattle Seahawks, Result: W 36-30\n- Week 16: December 25, 1999 vs Detroit Lions, Result: W 17-7\n- Week 17: January 2, 2000 vs San Diego Chargers, Result: L 12-6\n\nNow, the claim mentions November 6, 1999. Looking at the table, I need to find any row where the date is November 6, 1999.\n\nLooking through each week:\n\nWeek 9 is on November 7, which is the next day after November 6. So there's no game on November 6 in the table provided. The closest is Week 9, but that's November 7th.\n\nSo first part: Opponent San Diego Chargers on November 6, 1999. Since there's no game on that exact date, this part fails. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the Chargers weren't opponents on that specific date.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider maybe the week number might be different or perhaps the table is missing some weeks, but from what's given, November 6 isn't listed as a game date for the Chargers in 1999 based on the provided table.\n\nAlso, checking the result: even if there were a game on November 6 with Chargers, the claim says the result was W 17-33. Looking at the table, when Chargers played, their results are either L or W. Let's check Week 9 and Week 17:\n\nWeek 9 (November 7): Result was W 33-17\nWeek 17: Result was L 12-6\n\nNeither of these matches 17-33. So even if they were opponents on November 6, which they weren't in the table provided, the result wouldn't match.\n\nTherefore, both the date and result parts of the claim are incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe San Diego Chargers were not opponents on November 6, 1999, as there is no game listed for that date. Additionally, their results against other teams on relevant dates do not match the claimed outcome. \n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant cells:**\n- No relevant cells found for the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"In week 12 there be 1 game while in week 13 the game be against opponent kansas city chief.\"\n\nSo, two main points here:\n1. Week 12 had one game.\n2. In week 13, the game was against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nI'll need to check each of these points using the table. Let's go through the table row by row and see which weeks are relevant.\n\nLooking at the 'week' column, I can list out all the weeks present in the table:\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,17.\n\nWait, there's no week 12 mentioned. Hmm, that might be a problem for the first part of the claim. Let me confirm: weeks 1 through 11 are listed, then 13 onwards. So week 12 is missing. That would mean that in week 12, there was no game played according to the table provided.\n\nThat already contradicts the first part of the claim, which states there was one game in week 12. So that would make the claim FALSE on its own.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss anything. Scanning through each row:\n\nWeek 1: Yes, September 13.\n...\nWeek 11: November 22nd against Oakland Raiders. After that, week 13 is December 5th. So no week 12 entry. Therefore, the claim's first part is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to the second point for week 13: opponent is Kansas City Chiefs. Looking at week 13, the opponent is indeed listed as Kansas City Chiefs and the result was a loss (16-10). So that part of the claim is correct.\n\nHowever, since the first part of the claim about week 12 having one game is incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes two points. First, week 12 must have a game, but it's missing from the table. Second, week 13 against Kansas City Chiefs is present and correct. Since the first point fails, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"week 4 game did not have an attendance of 74181 and be played on October 3, 1999.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Week 4 game had an attendance NOT equal to 74181.\n2. The week 4 game was played on October 3, 1999.\n\nI'll need to check both conditions against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure: It has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week, starting from week 1 in September 1999 through week 17 in January 2000.\n\nSo first, I should locate week 4 in the table. Scanning down, I see that week 4 is indeed present. The date for week 4 is October 3, 1999. That matches the second part of the claim exactly. So condition two seems to be satisfied as per the table.\n\nNow, moving on to the attendance. According to the table, week 4's attendance was 74181. The claim states that this attendance does not equal 74181. Wait, but according to the table, it does equal 74181. So there's a conflict here. \n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"did not have an attendance of 74181.\" But in the table, week 4 has exactly that number. Therefore, the first part of the claim is FALSE because the attendance was indeed 74181. So the overall claim would be FALSE.\n\nHold on, but I need to check all conditions. The second condition about the date is correct. So even though one part is correct and the other isn't, since the entire statement uses \"and,\" meaning both conditions must be true for the claim to hold, but in reality, only the date matches and attendance does not match as per the claim.\n\nWait no\u2014the claim says it did NOT have that attendance AND was on Oct 3. So if week 4 game's attendance is indeed 74181, then the first part of the claim (that it didn't have that attendance) is false. The second part is true because it was played on Oct 3. However, since both conditions must be met for \"and,\" and one is false, the entire claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check two aspects of week 4: its date and attendance. Week 4 occurred on October 3, 1999, which aligns with the claim's second condition. However, the attendance for that game was 74181, contrary to the claim's first part, making the entire statement false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
