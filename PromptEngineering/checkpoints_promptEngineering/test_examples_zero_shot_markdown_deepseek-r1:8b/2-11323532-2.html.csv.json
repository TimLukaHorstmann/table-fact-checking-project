The claim says, \"the people from the country / region of Vietnam speak the language Vietnamese.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for Vietnam in the country/region column of the table. Scanning through each row, I see Vietnam is listed under the \"country / region\" column, specifically at row index 16.\n\nNext, I need to check what languages are spoken there. Looking at the \"languages\" column for Vietnam, it says \"vietnamese.\" So that's matching exactly with the claim.\n\nI don't think there's a need to check other columns like premiere, seasons, or status because the claim is specifically about the language spoken in Vietnam. The status might be ongoing or discontinued, but that doesn't affect whether they speak Vietnamese.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Vietnam speaks Vietnamese as per the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"languages\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the show in Israel be in the Hebrew language and be ongoing.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. There are two main assertions here:\n\n1. The show in Israel is in the Hebrew language.\n2. The show in Israel is ongoing.\n\nI'll need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on the row for Israel. Scanning through the rows, I see there's an entry for \"israel.\" Let me find that.\n\nHere's the relevant row:\n\n| country / region   | languages                | premiere                                                    | seasons              | status       |\n|:-------------------|:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------|\n| israel             | hebrew                   | 2005 - 12 - 02 02 - 12 - 2005                               | 1 2 3                | discontinued |\n\nSo, the country is Israel. Now, checking the \"languages\" column for this row: it's Hebrew. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the status column says \"discontinued.\" The claim states that the show is ongoing. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me double-check the table data. For Israel, languages are Hebrew, which is correct. Premiere date is 2005-12-02, and seasons are 1, 2, 3. Status is discontinued.\n\nSo the first part of the claim about the language being Hebrew is true, but the second part about the show being ongoing is false because it's actually discontinued.\n\nTherefore, since one part of the claim is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: checking if Israel's show is in Hebrew and ongoing. The table confirms the language but shows the status as discontinued, making the claim partially incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"languages\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"status\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
