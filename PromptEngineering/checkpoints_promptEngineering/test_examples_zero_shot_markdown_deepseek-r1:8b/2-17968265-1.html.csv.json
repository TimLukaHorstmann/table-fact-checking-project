    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"in the 1987 - 88 season, Newell's Old Boy scored 55 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the relevant information in the table. I'll start by identifying which columns are important here. The columns we need to check are 'team', 'average', 'points', and the seasons, specifically 1986-87, 1987-88, etc.\n\nI know that Newell's Old Boys is one of the teams listed, so I should locate their row in the table. Let me scan through the rows:\n\n1. independiente\n2. newell's old boys\n3. san lorenzo\n4. racing club\n5. boca juniors\n6. river plate\n7. rosario central\n8. deportivo espa\u00f1ol\n9. gimnasia de la plata\n10. v\u00e9lez s\u00e1rsfield\n11. estudiantes de la plata\n12. argentinos juniors\n13. talleres de c\u00f3rdoba\n14. ferro carril oeste\n15. deportivo mandiy\u00fa\n16. platense\n17. instituto de c\u00f3rdoba\n18. racing de c\u00f3rdoba\n19. san mart\u00edn de tucum\u00e1n\n20. deportivo armenio\n\nSo, Newell's Old Boys are row number 2 (index 1 if we start counting from 0).\n\nNext, I need to look at the 1987-88 season data for their points. The columns for the seasons are '1986 - 87', '1987 - 88', etc. So for Newell's Old Boys in row 2, the relevant column is '1987 - 88' and the 'points' column.\n\nLooking at row 2: \n- average: 1.193\n- points: 136\n- played: 114\n- 1986-87: 48\n- 1987-88: 55\n- 1988-89: 33\n\nWait, the claim says they scored 55 points in the 1987-88 season. From the table, their points for that season are indeed 55. So that's a match.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The 'points' column is separate from the season columns. So the total points for Newell's Old Boys in 1987-88 is 136 total points across all seasons? No, no, I think each row shows their performance per season, so the 'points' column should refer to that specific season. Wait, looking back at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are team, average, points, played, then three seasons: 1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89.\n\nSo for each team, in their respective row, the points under 'points' column is likely their total points for that season. So for Newell's Old Boys, in 1987-88, they scored 55 points, as per the table. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in sports, especially football leagues like in Argentina, points are accumulated over the season, and each game contributes to that. So the 'points' column here might be their total points for that season, not just one match. But regardless, the table shows 55 as the points for Newell's Old Boys in the 1987-88 season.\n\nSo the claim is stating they scored 55 points in 1987-88, which aligns with the data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Newell's Old Boys scored 55 points in the 1987-88 season. Checking the table, this team is at row index 1 (Newell's Old boys), and their points for the 1987-88 season are indeed 55.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific conditions in the claim. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31.\" Hmm, I think there might be some typos here because \"play\" doesn't seem to fit with the data in the table. Maybe it's referring to \"points\" instead of \"play.\" So, perhaps the intended claim is: \"When points are 107 and when 1987-88 is 31.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a team with their average, points, played games, and some seasons with their performance. The key columns here are \"points\" and \"1986-87\", \"1987-88\", etc.\n\nSo, the claim seems to be saying that for a particular team, when their total points are 107 and in the 1987-88 season they had 31 points, they played 114 games. Wait, no\u2014the original statement is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe claim says \"114 be play when point be 107...\" So maybe it's saying that for a team with 107 points, their played games (maybe \"played\" is the term) are 114, and also in 1987-88 they had 31 points. Wait, but looking at the table, each row has \"points,\" \"played,\" and three seasons.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is asserting that for a specific team, two conditions hold: their total points are 107, and in the 1986-87 season, they scored 31 points, while also having played 114 games. Wait, but looking at the table, I don't see any row where points are exactly 107.\n\nWait, let me check each row's points column:\n\nLooking through the \"points\" column: The closest is ferro carril oeste with 107 points, and deportivo mandiy\u00fa has 33 points. Hmm, but wait, no\u2014deportivo mandiy\u00fa actually has 33 total points, not 31.\n\nWait, let me go row by row:\n\n- Independiente: 139\n- Newell's old boys:136\n- San lorenzo:135\n- Racing club:132\n- Boca juniors:130\n- River plate:130\n- Rosario central:123\n- Deportivo espa\u00f1ol:122\n- Gimnasia de la plata:116\n- V\u00e9lez s\u00e1rsfield:115\n- Estudiantes de la plata:111\n- Argentinos juniors:110\n- Talleres de c\u00f3rdoba:109\n- Ferro carril oeste:107\n- Deportivo mandiy\u00fa:33\n- Platense:98\n- Instituto de c\u00f3rdoba:97\n- Racing de c\u00f3rdoba:97\n- San mart\u00edn de tucum\u00e1n:32\n- Deportivo armenio:59\n\nSo, the only team with 107 points is Ferro carril oeste. Now, let's check their played games and their performance in 1986-87 and 1987-88.\n\nLooking at Ferro carril oeste's row:\n\n- average: 1.07\n- points: 107\n- played: 114\n- 1986-87: 44 (points)\n- 1987-88: 33 (points)\n- 1988-89:30\n\nSo, the team has 107 total points, plays 114 games each season, and in 1987-88, they scored 33 points.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31.\" So it's asserting that for a team with 107 points, their 1986-87 would have some number, but specifically looking at 1987-88 being 31. However, in Ferro carril oeste's case, in 1987-88, they scored 33 points, not 31.\n\nSo, the claim is stating that when a team has 107 points and their 1987-88 performance was 31 points, then they played 114 games. But in reality, for Ferro carril oeste, their 1987-88 points were 33, not 31, so this condition isn't met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is miswritten and actually refers to a different team or different columns. Let me check if any other teams have points around that area.\n\nWait, Deportivo mandiy\u00fa has 33 points, which is close to 31, but their played games are only 38, not 114. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nSo, looking at the table, the claim's conditions don't align with any team's data. Therefore, it must be false because there's no team where points equal 107 and 1987-88 points equal 31 while also having played 114 games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is asserting that a specific team meets two conditions: having 107 total points and scoring 31 points in the 1987-88 season, while playing 114 games. However, upon examining the table, no such team exists where both these conditions are met simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is false because there is no team in the provided data that satisfies both conditions (107 total points and 31 points in the 1987-88 season) while also having played 114 games.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claimed Conditions:** The claim likely refers to a scenario where a team has 107 total points, scored 31 points in the 1987-88 season, and played 114 games.\n2. **Check Each Team's Points:** Review each team's total points column. Only Ferro carril oeste has 107 points, but they scored 33 points in 1986-87 and 33 in 1987-88.\n3. **Compare with Claimed 31 Points:** Since no team meets both the 107 total points and the specific 31-point performance in 1987-88, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",
