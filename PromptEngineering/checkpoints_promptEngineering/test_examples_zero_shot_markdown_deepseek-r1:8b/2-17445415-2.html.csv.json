    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"kelly dullanty have an overall record of 4 - 2 , by win their first 4 and then lose the rest.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Kelly Dullanty exists in the table. Looking at the 'opponent' column, I see names like lance wipf, matt serra, nuri shakir, etc. None of these are Kelly Dullanty. So that makes me think maybe the claim is referring to someone else or perhaps there's a typo.\n\nWait, but maybe Kelly Dullanty isn't in the table as an opponent but as the fighter? Let me check the 'record' column. The records are 4-2, 4-1, 4-0, 3-0, etc., but again, none of these seem to mention Kelly Dullanty. So perhaps the claim is about someone else.\n\nAssuming it's a different person, let's see if the pattern matches. The claim says overall record 4-2, winning first four and losing rest. Looking at the table, I need to check if any fighter has an overall record of 4-2 with four wins and two losses.\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row represents a fight. Let me parse that again. Each 'res' column is either win or loss. So for each fighter, their record is the sum of all their wins and losses across fights.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. loss: 4-2 vs lance wipf\n2. loss: 4-1 vs matt serra\n3. win: 4-0 vs nuri shakir\n4. win: 3-0 vs rudy vallederas\n5. win: 2-0 vs duane ludwig\n6. win: 1-0 vs shad smith\n\nWait, each row seems to be a separate fight with different opponents. So the overall record is the sum of all wins and losses for each fighter.\n\nLooking at the table again, it's structured such that each row has the result (win/loss), the opponent, method, event, round, and location.\n\nSo each fighter's record would be the total number of wins and losses they have across all their fights.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If a fighter has four wins and two losses, their overall record is 4-2.\n- Similarly, another fighter might have three wins and one loss (3-1), etc.\n\nBut looking at each row, the 'record' column seems to list individual fight results. Wait, no, actually, in the table provided, it looks like each row represents a single fight, not an overall record. The columns are res (win/loss), record (like 4-2, 4-1, etc.), opponent, method, event, round, location.\n\nWait, maybe I misread that. Let me look again:\n\nThe table has columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location.\n\nEach row represents a fight, where the fighter (I assume) had this result against the opponent using this method in event, round, and location.\n\nSo for each fighter, their overall record is the total wins minus total losses.\n\nBut the table doesn't list fighters; it lists opponents. So perhaps each row is a fighter's fight, and we need to see each fighter's total record.\n\nWait, but without knowing which rows correspond to whom, maybe each 'opponent' is someone else. It's unclear who the main fighter is in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents the same fighter's record against different opponents. But then, for example, if a fighter has 4 wins and 2 losses overall, that would be a 4-2 record.\n\nBut in the table, I see multiple rows where res is 'win' or 'loss', so each row adds to their total record.\n\nLooking at the first row: loss (so opponent's win?), record is 4-2. So maybe this represents the opponent having a 4-2 record after this fight? Or perhaps the fighter?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe claim says Kelly Dullanty has an overall record of 4-2 by winning her first four and then losing the rest. So if we assume she fought five times: first four wins, then one loss. But in the table, there are six fights listed.\n\nWait, but each row is a separate fight, so perhaps the fighter's total record is the sum across all their fights.\n\nBut without knowing which rows correspond to Kelly Dullanty, it's hard to say. Since Kelly Dullanty isn't listed as an opponent or as part of any res column, perhaps she's not in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is about her opponents, so each row represents a fight where she lost or won against them. But without knowing which rows are hers, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another angle: The 'record' column lists numbers like 4-2, 4-1, etc., which might be individual records of fighters. So if the claim is that Kelly Dullanty has a 4-2 record, we need to see if any fighter in the table has an overall 4-2 record.\n\nLooking through each row's 'record' column:\n\n- Row 0: loss, record 4-2\n- Row 1: loss, record 4-1\n- Row 2: win, record 4-0\n- Row 3: win, record 3-0\n- Row 4: win, record 2-0\n- Row 5: win, record 1-0\n\nWait, perhaps the 'record' column is the fighter's total after each fight. So for example:\n\n- After fight 0: loss, so maybe their record went from (say) 4-2 to 4-3?\n- Or perhaps it's the opponent's record.\n\nThis is confusing because the table structure isn't entirely clear. It might be that 'record' refers to the fighter's total wins and losses up to that point.\n\nBut without knowing which rows are for Kelly Dullanty, it's impossible to verify her 4-2 record in five fights (winning first four, losing one).\n\nSince Kelly Dullanty isn't listed as an opponent or a fighter in the table, the claim can't be fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Kelly Dullanty with a 4-2 record but she's not present in the table. The 'record' column lists other fighters' individual results, not overall records. Without evidence of Kelly Dullanty's fights in the table, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Kelly Dullanty's wins is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"2 of Kelly Dullanty's win be by decision, and each last at least 3 round.\" \n\nWait, that sentence seems a bit off. Maybe it's meant to say that two of Kelly Dullanty's wins are by decision, and each of these wins had at least three rounds. So I'll interpret it as: There are two wins for Kelly Dullanty where the method was a decision, and each of those wins lasted at least three rounds.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find Kelly Dullanty's wins. But wait, in the table provided, I don't see any entries for Kelly Dullanty. The opponents listed are Lance Wipf, Matt Serra, Nuri Shakir, Rudy Vallederas, Duane Ludwig, and Shad Smith. There's no Kelly Dullanty mentioned here.\n\nSo, if Kelly Dullanty isn't in the table at all, then there can't be any wins or losses attributed to her. Therefore, it's impossible for the claim to be true because she doesn't have any wins recorded in this table. \n\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me check each column in the table:\n\n- res: loss, win\n- record: numbers like 4-2, etc.\n- opponent: names of other fighters\n- method: ko, submission, decision, tko\n- event: specific fight events\n- round: either a number or 'n/a'\n- location: places like California, Nevada, Michigan\n\nLooking at the opponents again, Kelly Dullanty isn't among them. So, there's no data to support the claim.\n\nWait, maybe Kelly Dullanty is a fictional character? Or perhaps I'm misremembering her name. Let me think\u2014Kelly Dullanty doesn't ring a bell in my knowledge of UFC fighters. The table lists real opponents like Lance Wipf and Matt Serra, so it's unlikely Kelly Dullanty is an alias for someone else here.\n\nTherefore, the claim has no basis in reality based on this table. There are no wins by Kelly Dullanty to check against, let alone two that were decided by a decision with at least three rounds.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"both of Kelly Dullanty's losses have come in the first round.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if there are any losses for Kelly Dullanty in the table. Let me go through each row.\n\nLooking at the 'res' column: loss, loss, win, win, win, win. So Kelly must be the one with two losses here. Wait, but wait, looking at the opponents: lance wipf, matt serra, nuri shakir, rudy vallederas, duane ludwig, shad smith. Hmm, none of these names seem to be Kelly Dullanty. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nWait, maybe the 'res' column is the result, and each row represents a fight. So perhaps Kelly is fighting against these opponents? But that doesn't make sense because Kelly's name isn't listed as an opponent in any of the rows. Alternatively, maybe Kelly Dullanty is not an opponent but part of another column.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check the table again. The columns are res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location. So each row represents a fight that someone had. So if we're talking about Kelly Dullanty's losses, her name would be in the 'opponent' column? Or perhaps she is the fighter.\n\nWait, no, because the opponents are the people she fought against, so if Kelly lost to them, then those are her losses. But I don't see Kelly Dullanty listed as an opponent anywhere in this table. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the table is for someone else, not Kelly Dullanty. If that's the case, then Kelly might have no losses, making the claim false. Or perhaps Kelly isn't represented here at all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the 'record' column indicates whether it's a win or loss. So for each row where res is 'loss', we check if the opponent was Kelly Dullanty. But in this table, the opponents are lance wipf, matt serra, etc., not Kelly.\n\nWait, so maybe the claim is incorrect because there's no data on Kelly Dullanty in the table. Therefore, both of her losses haven't occurred, as she hasn't lost any fights here. So the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe table provided lists several fight records but does not mention Kelly Dullanty either as an opponent or participant.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Kelly's third win come against Rudy Vallederas by TKO, but outside of the typical round.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions Kelly's third win, specifically a victory over Rudy Vallederas via TKO (Technical Knockout) and that this happened outside the usual round structure.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's a match where Kelly fought against Rudy Vallederas with a TKO result, and also check if the round number is not a standard one. \n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. Row 0: loss against Lance Wipf via KO in round 1.\n2. Row 1: loss to Matt Serra via submission in round 1.\n3. Row 2: win against Nuri Shakir by decision in round 4.\n4. Row 3: win against Rudy Vallederas by TKO in round n/a (which is odd because rounds are typically numbered).\n5. Row 4: win over Duane Ludwig by decision in round 3.\n6. Row 5: win against Shad Smith via TKO in round 1.\n\nSo, the fourth row is the one where Kelly won against Rudy Vallederas by TKO. The round for this match is listed as \"n/a\" or not applicable. That's unusual because other matches have specific rounds like 1,3,4. \n\nThe claim states that the TKO happened outside of the typical round. Since the round is marked as n/a in the table, it suggests that maybe the fight didn't occur within a standard round format, perhaps it was the main event or something else. Therefore, this matches the claim's assertion.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 3 (res: win) and the column for opponent and method.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly's fight.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. I think they're trying to say that a technical knockout by strikes was the deciding factor in two of Kelly's fights. So, I need to look for fights where Kelly got a technical knockout due to strikes and that these were the decisive results.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided:\n\n| res   | record   | opponent        | method                      | event                             | round   | location                   |\n|:------|:---------|:----------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------|:--------|:---------------------------|\n| loss  | 4 - 2    | lance wipf      | ko (punch)                  | purecombat - bring the pain       | 1       | california , united states |\n| loss  | 4 - 1    | matt serra      | submission (triangle choke) | ufc 36                            | 1       | nevada , united states     |\n| win   | 4 - 0    | nuri shakir     | decision                    | ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13 | 4       | california , united states |\n| win   | 3 - 0    | rudy vallederas | tko                         | ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13 | n / a   | california , united states |\n| win   | 2 - 0    | duane ludwig    | decision                    | kotc 6 - road warriors            | 3       | michigan , united states   |\n| win   | 1 - 0    | shad smith      | tko (strikes)               | kotc 3 - knockout nightmare       | 1       | california , united states |\n\nWait, the res column has 'win' and 'loss' as results. The claim is about Kelly's fights, so I need to check if Kelly is the fighter in any of these rows. But looking at the opponent names: lance wipf, matt serra, nuri shakir, rudy vallederas, duane ludwig, shad smith. None of these seem like Kelly. So maybe Kelly's name isn't listed here, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the table doesn't mention Kelly at all. The res column shows wins and losses but not who the fighters are except the opponents. Maybe Kelly is the one with the wins and losses? Or perhaps this table is about another fighter named Kelly, not the one in question. Wait, the claim says \"Kelly's fight,\" so maybe the table is about Kelly's fights.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me read the problem again. The task is to determine if a claim about the table is true or false, and then provide relevant cells. But the table shows various res (win/loss), record, opponent, method, event, round, location. There's no mention of Kelly in the table. So perhaps Kelly is not present here, which would make the claim false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me parse the claim again: \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight.\" So it says that a technical knockout via strikes decided two of Kelly's fights. That would mean in two instances where Kelly fought, she won via a tko due to strikes.\n\nLooking at the table for any rows where res is 'win' and method includes 'tko (strikes)'. Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. loss: ko (punch)\n2. loss: submission\n3. win: decision\n4. win: tko (no round info)\n5. win: decision\n6. win: tko (strikes)\n\nSo rows 4 and 6 are wins via tko. But again, the opponents in these rows are nuri shakir and shad smith. If Kelly is not mentioned as an opponent or fighter here, perhaps she's not involved.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that 'kelly' refers to a fighter who won two fights with tko (strikes). So if the table shows two wins via tko (strikes), then that would support the claim. However, since Kelly isn't mentioned in the table, unless she's one of the opponents, which she isn't, this would be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the res column is for the fighter's result. If res is 'win' for Kelly, and method is tko (strikes) in two fights, then yes. But since Kelly isn't listed as an opponent or the fighter, it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says \"technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly's fight.\" So Kelly fought twice, and both times she won via tko (strikes). In the table, looking for 'win' and method as tko (strikes). There are two such rows: row 4 (method is tko, but round is n/a) and row 6 (tko by strikes).\n\nBut without Kelly being listed in the opponents or as the fighter, perhaps this is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe Kelly is the fighter with the wins, so her record would be win, win, etc. But since the table doesn't specify who the fighter is, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, no\u2014the res column shows the result of the fighter in each row. So if res is 'win', that means the fighter (let's assume Kelly is the fighter) won. So in two cases, she won via tko (strikes). Thus, those would be the relevant cells: rows 4 and 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to check each condition against the table. The claim has two parts: a technical knockout (strikes) and that it decided two of Kelly's fights.\n\nSo first, we need to find any row where method is tko (strikes). Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 4: method is tko\n- Row 6: method is tko (strikes)\n\nBoth are relevant for the technical knockout part.\n\nSecond, each of these rows should have decided Kelly's fight. So res should be 'win'. Yes, both rows 4 and 6 have res as win. Therefore, those two fights were won by a technical knockout (strikes), which would mean that they decided her fights.\n\nSo the claim is true because in two instances, Kelly's fights were decided by tko via strikes.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't mention Kelly at all. So perhaps this is a misinterpretation. Maybe the table is about another fighter named Kelly, but without that info, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the res column is for the opponent, not the fighter. That could change things.\n\nWait, in the table, each row seems to represent a fight where one fighter (opponent) fought against someone else, and the result was res: win or loss. So if Kelly is the main fighter, then perhaps her opponents are listed, and she has two wins via tko (strikes). But without knowing that, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is about a fighter named Kelly, in which case rows 4 and 6 would be her two wins via tko. So yes, the claim would be true.\n\nBut since the problem says \"You are tasked with determining whether the following statement is true or false,\" but doesn't specify who is in the table. It's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"You are tasked with determining if the following statement is true or false based on the given data.\"\n\nThe user hasn't provided any specific instructions beyond that, so perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nBut considering that the problem is presented as a task for me, I think the key points are:\n\n- The claim states that in two of Kelly's fights, she won via tko (strikes).\n- The table shows that there are two such wins where method is tko (strikes) and res is win.\n\nTherefore, even though Kelly isn't explicitly named, if we assume that the table represents her fights, then the claim is true. Alternatively, if the table doesn't represent her fights, it's false.\n\nBut without more context, I think the answer is that the statement is true based on the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is **true** based on the data provided in the table. There are two instances where Kelly won her fights via a technical knockout (strikes), as indicated by the method column.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look for rows where the result is a win and the method is a technical knockout (tko) via strikes.\n2. **Find Matching Rows:** \n   - Row 4: Win, Tko\n   - Row 6: Win, Tko (strikes)\n3. **Conclusion:** These two wins indicate that Kelly's fights were decided by tko (strikes), supporting the claim.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is true because there are two instances in the table where Kelly won her fights via a technical knockout (strikes).",

Let me start by breaking down the claim and comparing it to the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"Kelly dullanty have an overall record of 4 - 2, by win their first 4 and then lose the rest on event kotc 6 - road warrior.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the \"res\" column in the table to see if there's a record for Kelly Dullanty. Scanning through each row, I notice names like Lance Wipf, Matt Serra, Nuri Shakir, Rudy Vallederas, Duane Ludwig, and Shad Smith. None of these names match \"Kelly Dullanty.\" So that might be a problem because if she's not in the table, her record isn't there.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Could it be possible that Kelly Dullanty is referred to by another name or spelled differently? Looking again, no, the names are pretty distinct and don't seem to match. So perhaps the first part of the claim is false because she doesn't have any records in this table.\n\nNext, I'll check if there's a 4-2 record for her. Since she isn't listed anywhere, it's impossible for her record to be 4-2 here. That already suggests the claim is false.\n\nHowever, let me think deeper. Maybe Kelly Dullanty is involved in events not covered by this table. But according to the problem statement, I should only look at the provided data. So if she's not present, we can't consider her other fights.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions losing the rest after winning the first four. Looking at the \"event\" column, there are events like purecombat, UFC 36, IFC WC 13, etc., but none of these seem to align with the event name \"kotc 6 - road warrior.\" The table does have a row where opponent is Duane Ludwig and event is \"kotc 6 - road warriors\" (note the plural). But again, Kelly isn't present here.\n\nSo putting it all together: there's no record of Kelly Dullanty in the table, which means she doesn't have an overall record of 4-2.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Kelly Dullanty's losses is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"both of Kelly Dullanty's loss have come in the first round on event 'kotc 3 - knockout nightmare'\". So I need to check two things here: whether both losses are in the first round and if they were in that specific event.\n\nLooking at the table, I see five rows. The res column shows wins and losses, so Kelly must have had losses. Let me find all the loss records. \n\nThe third row is a win for Nuri Shakir over Lance Wipf with a KO. The fourth is another win for Rudy Vallederas, so that's not relevant. Then there are two losses: one against Matt Serra in UFC 36 and another against Shad Smith in Kotc 3.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"event kotc 3 - knockout nightmare.\" So I should look at Kelly Dullanty's losses to see if both happened in this event. In the table, I only see one loss for Kelly, which is row 5: res is loss, record 1-0 against Shad Smith via tko. The location is California, United States. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"both of Kelly Dullanty's losses.\" So maybe there are two losses? Let me check each row again. Hmm, I only see one loss for Kelly in the table\u2014against Shad Smith. There's another loss against Matt Serra in UFC 36, but that might be someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps Kelly Dullanty is not listed here, and maybe the claim is about someone else? No, the table seems to list opponents like Lance Wipf, Matt Serra, etc., so maybe Kelly Dullanty isn't in this table. Or perhaps I need to assume that all losses are hers.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify Kelly Dullanty's row; maybe they're referring to rows where res is loss. So the two losses would be rows 0 and 1. Let me see:\n\nRow 0: loss against Lance Wipf in event \"purecombat - bring the pain\" in California.\nRow 1: loss against Matt Serra in UFC 36, Nevada.\n\nBut the claim says both losses were on \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare.\" That's only one event. But in the table, the only loss for Kelly Dullanty (if that's her) is in row 5, which is against Shad Smith in Kotc 3. The other loss was in UFC 36, a different event.\n\nSo the claim is saying both of her losses came in the first round on that specific event. But according to the table, only one loss is on that event and in the first round (round 1), while another loss is in round 1 but a different event.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because not both losses are in the same event or round.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Kelly Dullanty's losses include at least one outside of \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about Kelly Dullanty's fights is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each condition against the table step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"2 of Kelly Dullanty's win be by decision, and each last at least 3 rounds in location Nevada, United States.\"\n\nI'll parse this into two main parts:\n\n1. Two wins are by decision.\n2. Each of these two wins took place in Nevada, United States, with the last round being at least 3.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all entries where the res is \"win\" because we're talking about Kelly Dullanty's wins. Then, check each condition for those rows.\n\nLet me list out all the rows where res is \"win\":\n\n- Row 2: win against Nuri Shakir, method=decision\n- Row 3: win against Rudy Vallederas, method=tko\n- Row 4: win against Duane Ludwig, method=decision\n- Row 5: win against Shad Smith, method=tko (strikes)\n\nWait, the claim says two wins by decision. So looking at these four rows:\n\n- Row 2: Decision \u2705\n- Row 3: Tko \u274c\n- Row 4: Decision \u2705\n- Row 5: Tko \u274c\n\nSo there are two decisions here (Rows 2 and 4). That part checks out.\n\nNow, the second condition is about each of these two wins being in Nevada, United States, with the last round being at least 3. Let me check the location for these rows:\n\n- Row 2: Location is California, not Nevada \u274c\n- Row 4: Location is Michigan, not Nevada \u274c\n\nWait a minute, both the wins by decision (Rows 2 and 4) are in different locations\u2014California and Michigan\u2014neither of which is Nevada. That means the second part of the claim isn't accurate because it claims both these specific wins occurred in Nevada.\n\nHold on, maybe I misread the rows. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking back at the table, Row 2: win against Nuri Shakir, location=california.\n\nRow 4: win against Duane Ludwig, location=michigan.\n\nSo neither of Kelly Dullanty's wins by decision is in Nevada, United States. Therefore, the claim's second condition isn't met because it refers to Nevada, but the actual locations are different.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"each last at least 3 rounds.\" Does that mean something about the number of rounds? Let me check the 'round' column for the two wins by decision:\n\n- Row 2: Round=4\n- Row 4: The round is listed as n/a because it's a win.\n\nWait, in Row 4, the round is \"n / a\", which probably stands for \"not applicable\" or \"unknown.\" So maybe that doesn't apply here. But since both of these wins (Rows 2 and 4) aren't in Nevada, the location part fails regardless of the rounds.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The claim states two wins by decision, but both are indeed by decision.\n- However, both those wins are not in Nevada; they're in California and Michigan.\n- Therefore, the second condition about the location is incorrect.\n\nHence, the entire claim isn't fully supported because while there are two decision wins, their locations don't match what's stated in the claim. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight with the same event",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false and then find which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding both the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it's a markdown format with several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. The rows list various fight results, some wins and losses, along with details like the opponent, how the fighter lost or won, the event name, the round number, and location.\n\nThe claim says: \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight with the same event.\" Let me break this down. It seems to suggest that Kelly had two fights where a technical knockout by strikes decided the outcome, and both these fights were part of the same event.\n\nNow, I need to look through the table for any relevant information about Kelly's fights. Looking at the opponent column: the opponents are lance wipf, matt serra, nuri shakir, rudy vallederas, duane ludwig, and shad smith. None of these names are \"kelly,\" so maybe the table is about another fighter named Kelly?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The opponents' names don't mention Kelly, but maybe the res column refers to the fighter's record in those fights. For example, a win or loss for the fighter.\n\nThe claim mentions \"technical knockout (strikes)\" deciding two of Kelly's fights within the same event. So I need to find if there are two fights by Kelly where the method was tko (strikes), and they occurred in the same event.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The third row: win, 4 - 0, nuri shakir, tko, ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13, round 4, location California.\n- Fourth row: win, 3 - 0, rudy vallederas, tko, same event, n/a round.\n- Fifth row: win, 2 - 0, duane ludwig, decision, different event.\n- Sixth row: win, 1 - 0, shad smith, tko (strikes), kotc 3 - knockout nightmare.\n\nWait, so in the third and fourth rows, it's about the same event, IFC WC 13. Both have wins via tko for Kelly? Or wait, no, looking back, the res column is \"win\" or \"loss,\" but who is Kelly here? Because the opponents are other names, not Kelly.\n\nHmm, maybe the table represents Kelly's fights. If so, then in row 3 and 4, Kelly won via tko, same event. So that would support the claim. Also, in row 6, she won via tko (strikes) but in a different event. But the claim says two of the same event.\n\nWait, let me check: The third and fourth rows both have method as tko and same event. So that's two instances where Kelly had a tko decision in the same event. So that would make the claim true.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if the table is about Kelly or someone else because the opponents are different names, but maybe Kelly is the fighter with multiple wins. Alternatively, perhaps Kelly is the opponent? That seems less likely since she's winning those fights.\n\nWait, no: If Kelly is the one who has these technical knockouts, then in two of her fights within the same event (IFC WC 13), she won via tko. So that would make the claim true because two of her fights in the same event were decided by a technical knockout due to strikes.\n\nAlternatively, if Kelly lost both times via tko, but the res is win, so she must have won those fights. Wait, no: looking at the table, res is 'win' or 'loss.' So for the rows where method is tko, it's a win because the fighter delivered the knockout.\n\nSo Kelly had two wins in the same event via tko (strikes). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need to identify which rows and columns are related. The method column for both third and fourth rows is 'tko' with 'strikes,' so their row indices are 2 and 3 (since indexing starts at 0), and column names 'method.' Also, the event column for both is the same, IFC WC 13.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about \"same event,\" so maybe the event column as well. So rows 2 and 3 have res=win, method= tko (strikes), event=IFC WC 13. Therefore, their row indices are 2 and 3, columns 'method' and 'event.'\n\nWait, no: in the table, row numbers are 0-based? Let me check:\n\nThe first row is index 0, second 1, etc. So rows where method is tko (strikes) are third and sixth.\n\nThird row: index 2, fourth row: index3, sixth row: index5.\n\nWait, in the table provided, the third row (index 2) is a win via tko, same event as the fourth row (index3). So those two rows would be relevant. Also, since the claim mentions \"same event,\" we need to look at the 'event' column for both. Both have IFC WC 13.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:2, column_name:'method'\n- row_index:2, column_name:'event'\n- row_index:3, column_name:'method'\n- row_index:3, column_name:'event'\n\nWait, but in the table, for index 2 (third row), 'event' is IFC WC 13, and method is tko. For index 3 (fourth row), same event and method tko. So both these rows have the same event, two wins via tko.\n\nTherefore, relevant_cells would include those four cells: (2, method), (2, event), (3, method), (3, event).\n\nBut wait, maybe just the method column is sufficient to verify that two of Kelly's fights were decided by a technical knockout. The event might be needed to confirm it's the same event, so both 'event' and 'method' columns are relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the method column is necessary because the same event is implied by having the same event name in multiple rows. But to be thorough, I should include all relevant cells that support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were two technical knockouts (strikes) deciding Kelly's fights within the same event. The table shows two such instances in rows 2 and 3, both with 'method' as tko (strikes) and 'event' as IFC WC 13. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** Kelly had two fights decided by a technical knockout (strikes) in the same event.\n2. **Review the Table:** Identify rows where method is tko (strikes) and ensure they are part of the same event.\n3. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - Rows 2 and 3 have 'method' as tko and same 'event'.\n   - Columns 'method' and 'event' for these rows provide necessary details.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is supported by two instances in the table, making it TRUE. The relevant cells are:\n\n- `row_index=2`, `column_name='method'`\n- `row_index=2`, `column_name='event'`\n- `row_index=3`, `column_name='method'`\n- `row_index=3`, `column_name='event'`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"Review a table to verify a claim about technical knockouts in the same event.\",\n  \"claim\": \"There were two technical knockouts (strikes) that decided Kelly's fights within the same event.\",\n  \"table\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"event\": \"Other Event\",\n      \"method\": \"Submission\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"event\": \"Submission Match\",\n      \"method\": \"TKO (Strikes)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"event\": \"IFC WC 13\",\n      \"method\": \"TKO (Strikes)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"event\": \"IFC WC 13\",\n      \"method\": \"TKO (Strikes)\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"result\": {\n    \"verdict\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Two instances found where Kelly's fights were decided by a technical knockout in the same event.\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"kelly 's be the only 1 never have third win come against rudy vallederas by tko , but outside of the typical round.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table. The key elements here are:\n\n1. \"kelly 's\" - This seems like a typo or misspelling. Looking at the table, the names listed are Lance Wipf, Matt Serra, Nuri Shakir, Rudy Vallederas, Duane Ludwig, and Shad Smith. There's no Kelly mentioned in the table. So perhaps \"kelly 's\" refers to someone else not listed here.\n\n2. \"never have third win come against rudy vallederas by tko\" - This suggests that Kelly has never achieved a third victory via TKO (Technical Knockout) specifically when fighting Rudy Vallederas.\n\n3. \"but outside of the typical round\" - The term \"typical round\" is a bit ambiguous, but it might refer to standard rounds in a fight or perhaps the usual structure of a match.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check if there's any row where Kelly fought Rudy Vallederas via TKO and whether it's their third win. However, since Kelly isn't in the table, maybe the claim is about someone else, possibly a typo for another fighter.\n\nWait, let me check each relevant column:\n\n- res: outcome (win/loss)\n- record: score\n- opponent: name of the fighter Kelly fought against.\n- method: how the fight ended.\n- event: the event name.\n- round: the round number in which it happened.\n- location: where the fight took place.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0:\nres: loss\nrecord: 4 - 2\nopponent: Lance Wipf\nmethod: ko (punch)\nevent: purecombat - bring the pain\nround: 1\nlocation: California, United States\n\nNo match against Rudy Vallederas here.\n\nRow 1:\nres: loss\nrecord: 4 - 1\nopponent: Matt Serra\nmethod: submission (triangle choke)\nevent: UFC 36\nround: 1\nlocation: Nevada, United States\n\nStill no Rud y Vallederas.\n\nRow 2:\nres: win\nrecord: 4 - 0\nopponent: Nuri Shakir\nmethod: decision\nevent: IFC WC 13 - Warriors Challenge 13\nround: 4\nlocation: California, United States\n\nNo match against Rudy here either.\n\nRow 3:\nres: win\nrecord: 3 - 0\nopponent: Rudy Vallederas\nmethod: tko\nevent: IFC WC 13 - Warriors Challenge 13\nround: n/a (which might mean the fight didn't go to a certain round)\nlocation: California, United States\n\nHere's a match against Rudy Vallederas where Kelly won via TKO. Now, is this their third win? Let me check if Kelly has three wins in total.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 0: loss\nRow 1: loss\nRow 2: win\nRow 3: win\nRow 4: win (opponent Duane Ludwig)\nRow 5: win (opponent Shad Smith)\n\nAssuming each res is a win, Kelly has five wins. If the claim refers to \"third win,\" then perhaps it's about their third victory being against Rudy Vallederas via TKO.\n\nBut wait, looking at row 3, the opponent is Rudy Vallederas and res is win with method tko. However, in this case, it's Kelly's second or later win? Let me count:\n\nRow 2: first win (against Nuri Shakir)\nRow 3: second win (against Rudy Vallederas via TKO)\nWait, no\u2014maybe each row is a separate fight, so each res is a single win/loss. So Kelly has five wins in total, and one of them was against Rudy Vallederas via TKO.\n\nBut the claim says \"never have third win come against rudy vallederas by tko.\" If Kelly's fifth win wasn't against Rudy Vallederas, then perhaps that part is correct.\n\nWait, no\u2014the table shows five wins: rows 2,3,4,5. So in row 3, it's their second fight where they won via TKO against Rudy. Therefore, their third win would have happened later, but not against Rudy.\n\nSo the claim suggests that Kelly never had a third win (i.e., her fifth victory) coming against Rudy Vallederas via TKO outside of the typical round. But looking at row 3, it's their second win against Rudy, and their fifth win is against someone else. So perhaps the claim is suggesting that she didn't have a third win over Rudy via TKO, which seems to be true because she only beat him once via TKO.\n\nHowever, the user instruction says Kelly's 's be the only 1, implying it's about her not having such a victory. Since in row 3, Kelly did defeat Rudy Vallederas via tko, but that was their second win, not third or fifth. So perhaps the claim is false because she does have at least one win against him.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list all the wins:\n\nRow 2: Win (4-0) vs Nuri Shakir\nRow 3: Win (3-0) vs Rudy Vallederas\nRow 4: Win (2-0) vs Duane Ludwig\nRow 5: Win (1-0) vs Shad Smith\n\nSo Kelly has four wins in the table, but wait, the res column shows five entries. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the table, there are six rows, each with a res of win or loss.\n\nLooking at res:\n\nloss: two entries\nwin: four entries\n\nBut wait, row 3's record is 3-0 and the method is tko against Rudy Vallederas.\n\nSo Kelly has four wins in total: against Nuri, Rudy, Duane, and Shad. The claim says she never had a third win (i.e., her fourth) come against Rudy via TKO outside of typical rounds.\n\nBut in reality, her second win was against Rudy via tko, not her fourth or fifth. So the claim's assertion is that Kelly didn't have such a victory, but since she did beat Rudy via tko once, the claim would be false because she has at least one win over him via tko.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the table shows Kelly did defeat Rudy Vallederas via TKO in one of her wins.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Kelly has never had a third win (fourth victory) against Rudy Vallederas by TKO outside typical rounds. However, the table shows Kelly defeating Rudy Vallederas via TKO in row 3, which is her second win. Therefore, the claim is false because Kelly did have at least one victory over Rudy.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"description\": \"Kelly's second win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
