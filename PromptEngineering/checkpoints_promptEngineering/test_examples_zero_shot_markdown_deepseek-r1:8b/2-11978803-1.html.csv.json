    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the competition on august 15 , 2012 , which result in a win , be play at a baku , venue.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand each part of the claim. It mentions three main points:\n\n1. The competition date is August 15, 2012.\n2. The result of that competition was a win.\n3. The venue where this competition took place was Baku.\n\nNow, I need to check these points against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table columns: date, venue, score, result, competition.\n\nI'll start by finding the row for August 15, 2012. Scanning through the dates:\n\n- March 7, 2007\n- June 2, 2007\n- August 22, 2007\n- September 12, 2007\n- June 4, 2008\n- November 19, 2008\n- August 15, 2012\n\nYes, there's a row for August 15, 2012.\n\nNext, let's check the result for that date. The score is \"3 - 0\", and the result is \"win.\" So, it does result in a win, which matches the second part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the venue for that competition. In the same row, the venue is listed as \"baku , azerbaijan.\" This matches the third point in the claim, which specifies the venue as Baku.\n\nPutting it all together: The competition on August 15, 2012, resulted in a win and was played at the Baku venue. All three parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and I'll need to identify the relevant cells that verify this.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"On August 15, 2012, the team booked a win in a friendly competition match.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each part of this claim against the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe date in the claim is August 15, 2012. Looking at the table, I'll scan through the dates column for that exact date. Scanning each row: March 7, 2007; June 2, 2007; August 22, 2007; September 12, 2007; June 4, 2008; November 19, 2008; and then August 15, 2012. Yep, that's the fourth row from the bottom. So the date matches exactly.\n\nNext, I need to see where this match took place. The venue for August 15, 2012, is Baku, Azerbaijan according to the table. The claim mentions a friendly competition match, which the relevant column is 'competition' in the table. For that specific date, the competition is listed as 'friendly', so that matches too.\n\nLooking at the score, the claim says they booked a win. In the table, under 'score' for August 15, 2012, it's 3 - 0. Since the team won, that's correct. So the result would be 'win' in the 'result' column, which also matches.\n\nPutting it all together: date, venue, score, and result all align with the claim. There are no discrepancies or missing information here. Each cell relevant to the claim is satisfied.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all relevant cells match correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim specifically mentions \"on august 15 , 2012 the game have a score of 3 - 0 and result in a win.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to August 15, 2012. Looking at the dates in the table:\n\n- March 7, 2007\n- June 2, 2007\n- August 22, 2007\n- September 12, 2007\n- June 4, 2008\n- November 19, 2008\n- August 15, 2012\n\nSo the last row is August 15, 2012. That's the relevant row for the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check the score and result columns for this row. The score column shows \"3 - 0\" and the result is \"win.\" This matches exactly with what the claim states: a score of 3-0 and a win.\n\nTherefore, all the information in the claim aligns perfectly with the data in the table's relevant row.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the uefa euro 2008 qualifying have a result of lost.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. It lists several matches with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. I'm focusing on the 'result' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nThe competition mentioned in the claim is \"UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.\" So I need to find all rows where the competition is this. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. The first row is a friendly match, so not relevant.\n2. Second row: competition is \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying\" \u2013 that's the one we're interested in.\n3. Third row: friendly again.\n4. Fourth row: friendly.\n5. Fifth row: friendly.\n6. Sixth row: friendly.\n7. Seventh row: friendly.\n\nSo only the second row matches the competition name in the claim. Now, looking at the result for that particular match. The score is \"1 - 3\" and the result is \"lost.\" \n\nThe claim states that the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying had a result of lost. Since this specific match under UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying resulted in a loss, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: the row index for the second entry is 1 (since it's zero-indexed). The column we're looking at is 'result'. So the relevant cells are row 1 and column \"result\".\n\nI think that covers everything. The claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the competition that he win on june 2 , 2007 be friendly.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which parts of the claim are relevant to the table. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Competition**: The claim mentions a specific competition, which in this case is \"friendly.\"\n2. **Date and Venue**: It refers to June 2, 2007, in Baku, Azerbaijan.\n3. **Result**: The claim states that he won the competition on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to June 2, 2007. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- March 7, 2007\n- June 2, 2007\n- August 22, 2007\n- September 12, 2007\n- June 4, 2008\n- November 19, 2008\n- August 15, 2012\n\nSo the second row (index 1) is June 2, 2007 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The score there is 1 - 3, and the result is \"lost.\" \n\nWait a minute, that's conflicting with the claim. The claim says he won, but according to the table, he lost on that date. So the competition listed under June 2, 2007 isn't a friendly one where he won. Instead, it was part of the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying and he lost.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the actual result was a loss, not a win. \n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. The row in question is June 2, 2007 (row index 1), and the columns involved are \"result\" and perhaps \"competition.\" But since the claim specifically mentions the competition being friendly, it's crucial to check both the result and the competition type.\n\nLooking at the table for that row:\n- date: june 2 , 2007\n- venue: baku , azerbaijan\n- score: 1 - 3\n- result: lost\n- competition: uefa euro 2008 qualifying\n\nThe \"competition\" column is UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, not friendly. So even though the claim refers to the competition being friendly, the table shows it's actually a different competition.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the entire row for June 2, 2007, specifically the \"result\" and \"competition\" columns because they directly contradict the claim. The other columns like date and venue are supportive but not central to the issue.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the friendly competition at the venue shymkent , kazakhstan , be on june 2 , 2007.\" So, the claim is making two specific claims:\n\n1. The competition is a friendly one.\n2. The venue is Shymkent, Kazakhstan.\n3. This event took place on June 2, 2007.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table to see if there's an entry that matches all these criteria. \n\nThe table has several columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. Each row represents a different match. Let me go through each row to check for the relevant information.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Date: March 7, 2007\n- Venue: Shymkent, Kazakhstan\n- Result: Win (friendly)\n\nThis seems promising because the venue matches, but the date is March 7, not June 2. So this can't be the one.\n\nSecond row:\n- Date: June 2, 2007\n- Venue: Baku, Azerbaijan\n- Result: Lost (UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying)\n- Competition: UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying\n\nHere, the date matches, but the venue is different. Also, the competition type isn't friendly, it's a qualifier. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThird row:\n- Date: August 22, 2007\n- Venue: Dushanbe, Tajikistan (I think there might be a typo here; maybe it's supposed to be Dushan or another city?)\n- Result: Win (friendly)\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nVenue doesn't match Shymkent. Date is August, so not June 2.\n\nFourth row:\n- Date: September 12, 2007\n- Venue: Baku, Azerbaijan\n- Result: Draw (Friendly)\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nAgain, venue isn't Shymkent and date is September, not June.\n\nFifth row:\n- Date: June 4, 2008\n- Venue: Andorra la Vella, Andorra\n- Result: Win (Friendly)\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nVenue doesn't match, and the date is June 4, not June 2.\n\nSixth row:\n- Date: November 19, 2008\n- Venue: Baku, Azerbaijan\n- Result: Draw (Friendly)\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nNot matching venue or date.\n\nSeventh row:\n- Date: August 15, 2012\n- Venue: Baku, Azerbaijan\n- Result: Win (Friendly)\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nStill not Shymkent and wrong date.\n\nWait a second, I think I might have missed something. The first row is March 7, 2007 in Shymkent, but the claim mentions June 2, 2007. So no match there. The other entries don't have both Shymkent venue and friendly competition on June 2.\n\nBut wait, looking again at the table, I notice that the first row is March 7, 2007, in Shymkent, with a friendly result. But the claim refers to June 2, 2007. There's no other entry for Shymkent after that date. So perhaps there isn't a match on June 2, 2007, at Shymkent.\n\nBut wait, I should check each row carefully. Let me list them with their details:\n\n1. March 7, 2007 \u2013 Shymkent \u2013 Win (friendly)\n2. June 2, 2007 \u2013 Baku \u2013 Lost (UEFA qualifying)\n3. August 22, 2007 \u2013 Dushanbe, Tajikistan \u2013 Win (friendly)\n4. September 12, 2007 \u2013 Baku \u2013 Draw (friendly)\n5. June 4, 2008 \u2013 Andorra \u2013 Win (friendly)\n6. November 19, 2008 \u2013 Baku \u2013 Draw (friendly)\n7. August 15, 2012 \u2013 Baku \u2013 Win (friendly)\n\nNone of these entries have both the venue as Shymkent and the date as June 2, 2007, with a friendly competition. The only entry for Shymkent is March 7, 2007, which doesn't match the date in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no such friendly competition on June 2, 2007, at Shymkent, Kazakhstan.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking for \"friendly\" in competition and venue as \"shymkent, kazakhstan\". The only friendly is rows 1,3,4,5,6,7. But none of them are on June 2, 2007.\n\nWait, but looking at the claim: it says \"the friendly competition at the venue shymkent , kazakhstan , be on june 2 , 2007.\" So it's combining three things: friendly competition, venue Shymkent, and date June 2, 2007. \n\nSo in the table, does any row have all three? Let me check:\n\n- Row 1: March 7, 2007 \u2013 friendly, Shymkent, but not June 2.\n- Other rows either don't have Shymkent or aren't friendly on June 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no such match in the table that matches all three criteria. The only friendly at Shymkent is March 7, 2007, which isn't June 2, and the other friendlys are either not in Shymkent or not on June 2.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The competition is as required, the score matches \"1 - 3\", but where is the venue? It's in Baku, Azerbaijan, not Andorra la Vella, Andorra.

The claim says: \"the uefa duro 2008 qualify competition have a result of lost and be hold august 22 , 2007.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see how it relates to the table. The claim mentions two specific things: the competition is called \"uefa duro 2008 qualify,\" the result is a loss, and the match took place on August 22, 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, the column names are date, venue, score, result, and competition. I need to find any rows that match these criteria.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. March 7, 2007: Venue is Shymkent, Kazakhstan. Competition is friendly. Doesn't match the competition name or the date.\n2. June 2, 2007: Venue is Baku, Azerbaijan. Competition is UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying. The result here is lost. But the date is June 2, not August 22. So it's a different date.\n3. August 22, 2007: Venue is Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Result is win. Doesn't match the competition or result.\n4. September 12, 2007: Venue is Baku, Azerbaijan. Competition is friendly. Doesn't match.\n5. June 4, 2008: Venue is Andorra la Vella, Andorra. Result is win. Not relevant.\n6. November 19, 2008: Venue is Baku, Azerbaijan. Draw result. Not relevant.\n7. August 15, 2012: Venue is Baku, Azerbaijan. Win result. Not relevant.\n\nNow, the claim mentions the competition as \"uefa duro 2008 qualify.\" Looking at the table, I see a row on June 2, 2007, where the competition is \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying\" (without the word 'duro'). Also, the date doesn't match August 22.\n\nNext, checking for the result. The claim says the result was a lost. In the table, the only lost result is on June 2, 2007, but that's not the correct competition name or date as per the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Does \"uefa duro 2008 qualify\" exist in the table? No, the closest is \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying.\" So the competition name doesn't match exactly. Also, August 22, 2007: looking at that row, the result was a win, not lost.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim has two issues: the competition name isn't correctly specified in the table (it's \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying,\" not \"duro\"), and the date and result don't align with any row where both conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly refers to a competition that doesn't exist in the table. Even though there's a match on August 22, 2007, it's against Kazakhstan with a win, not a loss for the EURO qualifier.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
