    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the largest crowd to attend a VFL game be at the Richmond versus Footscray game.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's asserting that the game between Richmond and Footscray had the largest crowd in the VFL games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with columns for home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim is specifically about the crowd size, so I need to focus on the \"crowd\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the crowd numbers:\n\n1. Hawthorn vs North Melbourne: 11000\n2. Fitzroy vs St Kilda: 15000\n3. Essendon vs Melbourne: 20000\n4. Richmond vs Footscray: 26000\n5. South Melbourne vs Collingwood: 17000\n6. Geelong vs Carlton: 15000\n\nFrom these numbers, the largest crowd is 26000, which is for the Richmond versus Footscray game. The claim mentions this specific game as having the largest crowd, so it seems to be true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant column is \"crowd,\" and the row where this happens is the fourth one (index 3). So, the cell at row_index 3 and column_name \"crowd\" is relevant.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyze the \"crowd\" column in the table. The largest crowd listed is 26,000 for the Richmond vs. Footscray game, which matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"April 1939, Hawthorn destroyed North Melbourne, 17 to 11.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. It mentions the date (April 1939), the home team (Hawthorn), the away team (North Melbourne), and the score (17 to 11). So, to verify this, I need to check each of these aspects against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a markdown format with several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match on that specific date.\n\nThe date given in the claim is April 29, 1939, because looking at the table, all matches on April 29, 1939 are for that day. So the exact month and year are correct, but I need to check if the other details align.\n\nNext, checking the home team: Hawthorn is listed as the home team in the first row of the table. So that part matches. The away team is North Melbourne, which is also correctly listed in the same row.\n\nNow, looking at the scores: The claim says Hawthorn scored 17 to North Melbourne's 11. In the table, Hawthorn's score is 17.13 (115), and North Melbourne scored 11.11 (77). The numbers in the parentheses represent goals and total points. However, the claim only mentions 17 to 11, which are the goal counts, not the total points. So, this part might be tricky.\n\nWait, does the term \"destroyed\" imply something more than just scoring more goals? Typically, in sports, a team is said to have destroyed another if they won by a significant margin or perhaps if they scored more points overall. But in this case, both teams' scores are 17-11 on goals, which translates to total points of Hawthorn: 115 and North Melbourne: 77. So Hawthorn did win the match.\n\nBut does \"destroyed\" refer strictly to the goal count or the total points? The claim mentions 17 to 11, which is just the goal counts. However, in the table, the home team's score includes both goals and behinds (like 17.13). So perhaps the claim is simplifying it by only stating the goal count.\n\nI think the key here is whether the date, teams, and goal count all match correctly. The date is April 29, 1939, which aligns with the table's data. The home team is Hawthorn, and the away team is North Melbourne, both of which are correct. The score mentioned in the claim is 17-11, which matches exactly with the \"home score\" and \"away score\" columns.\n\nSo putting it all together: date matches, teams match, and the score as per the claim (17 to 11) matches. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified correctly based on the provided table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. Let's see what the claim is and how to verify it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the claim: \"the lowest attended game be hawthorn versus north melbourne , with 11000 in attendance.\" So, the claim is saying that the game between Hawthorn and North Melbourne had the lowest attendance, specifically 11,000 people.\n\nNow, I need to check the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match.\n\nI should go through each row to find out which ones are relevant for this claim. Let me start by identifying which game is Hawthorn vs. North Melbourne. Looking at the first column (home team), the first row has \"hawthorn\" as the home team, and the second column lists the away team as \"north melbourne\". So that's the game we're interested in.\n\nNext, I need to find out what the crowd number is for this particular match. In the fifth column, which is labeled \"crowd\", the first row has a value of 11000. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions it's the \"lowest attended game.\" So I should check if any other games had lower attendance than 11,000 or not. Let me go through all the rows to find the lowest crowd number.\n\nLooking at the \"crowd\" column:\n\n- First row: 11000\n- Second row: 15000 (Fitzroy vs St Kilda)\n- Third row: 20000 (Essendon vs Melbourne)\n- Fourth row: 26000 (Richmond vs Footscray)\n- Fifth row: 17000 (South Melbourne vs Collingwood)\n- Sixth row: 15000 (Geelong vs Carlton)\n\nThe lowest number here is 11000, which is indeed the Hawthorn vs North Melbourne game. No other games have a lower crowd number than this. So the claim that it's the lowest attended game with 11,000 in attendance is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because all the relevant data points match what the claim states.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the highest scoring game be when richmond play footscary , richmond score 20.19\". So, it's saying that in a game where Richmond plays Footscray, Richmond scored 20.19 points. My task is to check if this information is present and correct in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. So, for each game, I can see which teams played, their scores, etc.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's a game where the home team is Richmond and the away team is Footscray. If such a match exists, then I'll look at the home team's score for Richmond.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Hawthorn vs North Melbourne: No Richmond or Footscray.\n2. Fitzroy vs St Kilda: No.\n3. Essendon vs Melbourne: No.\n4. Richmond vs Footscray: Yes! Here, the home team is Richmond and the away team is Footscray.\n\nNow, what's Richmond's score in that game? According to the table, it's 20.19 (139). So the claim says Richmond scored 20.19, which matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. Now, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table. The home team is Richmond at row_index 4, column \"home team\". The score is in the \"home team score\" column for that row.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 4, column \"home team\"\n- Row index 4, column \"home team score\"\n\nI should make sure to list these correctly in JSON format as specified.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if Richmond played against Footscray and their respective scores.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the game between Richmond and Footscray:** Found in row index 4 of the table.\n2. **Check Richmond's score:** The home team (Richmond) scored 20.19, which matches the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE with the relevant cells identified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"All the VFL game play on April 29, 1939 have more than 10,000 crowd in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The VFL games are the ones listed in the table with home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd numbers, and dates. The specific date mentioned is April 29, 1939.\n\nLooking at the table, all the rows have the same date: April 29, 1939. So that part matches up with the claim's focus on games from that day.\n\nNow, the claim says that each of these games had more than 10,000 attendees. I need to check each game's crowd number against this threshold.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Hawthorn vs North Melbourne**: Crowd is 11,000. That's above 10,000.\n2. **Fitzroy vs St Kilda**: Crowd is 15,000. Also above 10,000.\n3. **Essendon vs Melbourne**: Crowd is 20,000. Definitely more than 10k.\n4. **Richmond vs Footscray**: Crowd is 26,000. Way over.\n5. **South Melbourne vs Collingwood**: Crowd is 17,000. Above 10k.\n6. **Geelong vs Carlton**: Crowd is 15,000. Also above.\n\nWait a second, all of them have more than 10,000? Let me double-check each number to make sure I'm not missing anything. \n\n- 11,000: Yes, that's over 10k.\n- 15k: Definitely yes.\n- 20k and 26k are definitely above.\n- 17k is also above.\n- 15k again.\n\nSo all six games on April 29, 1939, had crowds exceeding 10,000. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on this analysis.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that the table accurately represents each game's crowd number and date. Since all the dates in the table are April 29, 1939, and all crowd numbers are above 10k, there's no discrepancy here.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because every listed game on that date had more than 10,000 attendees.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze each relevant cell in the table:\n\n- **Claim Check**: Each VFL game on April 29, 1939, must have a crowd of over 10,000.\n- **Analysis**:\n  - All six games listed have their date as April 29, 1939.\n  - The crowd numbers for each game are all above 10,000.\n\nSince every game meets the condition specified in the claim, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"april 29 1939 , essendon destroy north melbourne , 17 to 11\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The date mentioned is April 29, 1939. Looking at the table, all the matches listed are on this date (29 april 1939), so that part checks out.\n\nNext, the home team in the claim is Essendon. Scanning through the table, I see a row where the home team is Essendon. Let me check each row:\n\n1. Hawthorn vs North Melbourne\n2. Fitzroy vs St Kilda\n3. Essendon vs Melbourne\n4. Richmond vs Footscray\n5. South Melbourne vs Collingwood\n6. Geelong vs Carlton\n\nYes, the third row has Essendon as the home team. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the away team in the claim is North Melbourne. Looking at the same row where Essendon is the home team, the away team listed is Melbourne. Wait, that doesn't match because the claim says \"north melbourne\" but the table shows \"melbourne\". Could this be a typo or different naming? I should check all possible matches to ensure there's no other North Melbourne as an away team.\n\nLooking through the rest of the rows:\n\n- Hawthorn vs North Melbourne (Row 0)\n- Fitzroy vs St Kilda (Row 1)\n- Essendon vs Melbourne (Row 2)\n- Richmond vs Footscray (Row 3)\n- South Melbourne vs Collingwood (Row 4)\n- Geelong vs Carlton (Row 5)\n\nOnly Row 0 has North Melbourne as the away team. So, if the claim says Essendon vs North Melbourne, it's actually Essendon vs Melbourne in the table. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The third row is Essendon (home) vs Melbourne (away). So the claim mentions \"north melbourne\" as the away team, which isn't present here. Therefore, it doesn't match.\n\nThe score part of the claim says 17 to 11. Looking at the relevant row (Row 2), Essendon's score is 19.21 (135) and Melbourne's score is 21.15 (141). The claim's scores are 17 vs 11, which don't align with these numbers.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Date matches.\n- Home team is correct (Essendon).\n- Away team in the claim doesn't match what's in the table (Melbourne instead of North Melbourne).\n- Scores also don't match.\n\nSince the away team and scores don't align, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, it should be marked as FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The row where Essendon is the home team (row 2) for all the necessary information: home team, away team, and scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not match the table's data regarding the away team and scores, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has information about various games, including the home and away teams, their scores, the venue, crowd size, and the date. The claim in question is: \"the largest crowd to attend a VFL game be at the Richmond versus Collingwood game.\"\n\nFirst, I need to carefully check each condition of this claim against the table provided. Let's break down the claim into its key parts.\n\n1. **Largest Crowd**: The claim specifies that it's about the largest crowd attending a VFL game. So, I'm looking for the highest number in the 'crowd' column across all games in the table.\n\n2. **Richmond versus Collingwood**: This means I need to find a match where Richmond is playing against Collingwood. So, I should look for both teams in the same row of the table.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to verify these points.\n\n- **Row 0**: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne. Not relevant because it's not Richmond vs Collingwood.\n- **Row 1**: Fitzroy vs St Kilda. Again, not the relevant match.\n- **Row 2**: Essendon vs Melbourne. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 3**: Richmond vs Footscray. Here, Richmond is playing, but Collingwood isn't involved. So this row might have Richmond's crowd data, but not against Collingwood.\n- **Row 4**: South Melbourne vs Collingwood. Now, here Collingwood is the away team. The home team is South Melbourne, and the away team is Collingwood. This seems to be the match we're interested in.\n- **Row 5**: Geelong vs Carlton. Not relevant.\n\nWait, but in row 3, Richmond is playing against Footscray, which isn't Collingwood. So, perhaps I missed a row where Richmond plays Collingwood. Let me double-check each game to ensure I didn't overlook any.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- In row 4, South Melbourne hosts Collingwood. That's the only match in the table involving both Richmond and Collingwood?\n\nWait no, row 3 is Richmond vs Footscray. So, looking at all rows, the only occurrence of Collingwood is in row 4 against South Melbourne, not against Richmond.\n\nSo does that mean there's no game between Richmond and Collingwood in this table? Or did I miss it? Let me check each match.\n\nRow 0: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne \u2013 no.\n\nRow 1: Fitzroy vs St Kilda \u2013 no.\n\nRow 2: Essendon vs Melbourne \u2013 no.\n\nRow 3: Richmond vs Footscray \u2013 yes, but not Collingwood.\n\nRow 4: South Melbourne vs Collingwood \u2013 yes, that's a different game.\n\nRow 5: Geelong vs Carlton \u2013 no.\n\nSo, in the table provided, there is no game where Richmond plays against Collingwood. Therefore, if the claim says the largest crowd was at this specific game, then the claim is false because such a game doesn't exist in the given data.\n\nWait, but let me check if I misread any row. Let's go through each row carefully:\n\n- Row 0: hawthorn vs north melbourne \u2013 no.\n- Row 1: fitzroy vs st kilda \u2013 no.\n- Row 2: essendon vs melbourne \u2013 no.\n- Row 3: richmond vs footscray \u2013 yes, but not collingwood.\n- Row 4: south melbourne vs collingwood \u2013 this is a different game.\n- Row 5: geelong vs carlton \u2013 no.\n\nSo, indeed, the only games involving Collingwood are when they play South Melbourne. There's no Richmond vs Collingwood game in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the largest crowd attended the Richmond versus Collingwood game is false because such a game isn't listed in the provided data.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if the crowd size for the South Melbourne vs Collingwood game is indeed the largest. Looking at the 'crowd' column:\n\n- Row 3: 26,000 \u2013 that's Richmond vs Footscray.\n- Row 4: 17,000 \u2013 South Melbourne vs Collingwood.\n\nSo, the Richmond game has a larger crowd of 26,000 compared to 17,000 for the Collingwood game. But since there is no Richmond vs Collingwood game in the table, the claim is false because that specific match didn't occur with such a crowd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is suggesting that the largest crowd attended any VFL game was at the Richmond vs Collingwood game, but if that particular game isn't in the table, then it's false. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about whether the game between Richmond and Collingwood had the largest crowd, regardless of whether it's in this table or not. But since the data given doesn't include a Richmond vs Collingwood game, we can only consider the games listed.\n\nIn that case, the largest crowd was at the Richmond vs Footscray game with 26,000 attendees.

Attendance is 15k, but it's a different game.\n\nRow 2: Essendon vs Melbourne; not North Melbourne. Their crowd is 20k, so doesn't match.\n\nRow 3: Richmond vs Footscray; again, not the right teams. Crowd 26k.\n\nRow 4: South Melbourne vs Collingwood; crowd 17k, not 15k for the Essendon game.\n\nRow 5: Geelong vs Carlton; no, attendance is 15k but not the correct teams.\n\nWait, so where's Essendon vs North Melbourne? Looking back at the table, I don't see that specific pairing. The only Essendon game is against Melbourne (Row 2) and the only North Melbourne game is against Hawthorn (Row 0). So there's no row in the table with both Essendon as home team and North Melbourne as away.\n\nThat suggests that either the claim is incorrect because such a game doesn't exist in the table, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding which game is being referred to. But according to the data given, there's no Essendon vs North Melbourne game on 29 April 1939 with an attendance of 15,000. In fact, the only games with 15,000 are Fitzroy vs St Kilda and Geelong vs Carlton.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no game in the table that matches both teams (Essendon vs North Melbourne) and has a crowd of exactly 15,000. Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading the team names? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row 2: Essendon is home against Melbourne with 20k attendance. No match for North Melbourne here.\n\nRow 0: Hawthorn hosts North Melbourne, which is a different game from Essendon vs North Melbourne.\n\nSo, there's no such game in the table that matches the claim. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attended game is Essendon versus North Melbourne with 15,000 attendees. However, after examining the table, there's no entry for a game between Essendon and North Melbourne. The closest entries are Hawthorn vs North Melbourne (11k) and Geelong vs Carlton (15k), but neither involves Essendon against North Melbourne. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the highest scoring game be when richmond play footscary , richmond score 19.21",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest scoring game be when richmond play footscary , richmond score 19.21\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a game where Richmond plays Footscray and that Richmond scored 19.21 points. So my task is to check if there's a row in the table that matches this exactly.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists several games with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The claim specifies both teams as Richmond and Footscray. From the table, I can scan each row to find if there's a match.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne. Not relevant.\n2. **Second Row**: Fitzroy vs St Kilda. Not relevant.\n3. **Third Row**: Essendon vs Melbourne. Not relevant.\n4. **Fourth Row**: Richmond vs Footscray. This looks promising because the home team is Richmond and the away team is Footscray. Now I need to check their scores.\n\nIn this row, Richmond's score is listed as 20.19 (139). Wait a minute, the claim says Richmond scored 19.21. That doesn't match because 20.19 isn't equal to 19.21.\n\nWait, did I read that correctly? Let me double-check. The claim has Richmond scoring 19.21, but in the table, Richmond's score against Footscray is 20.19. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in looking at the row indices or columns. Let me verify again. The fourth row (index 3) has home team Richmond and away team Footscray. Their scores are 20.19 for Richmond and 17.8 for Footscray. So yes, Richmond's score is 20.19, not 19.21.\n\nHmm, so the claim says Richmond scored 19.21 in this game, but according to the table, they actually scored 20.19. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the column names. Let me check the columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date. So for row index 3, the home team is Richmond, and their score is 20.19 (139). The away team is Footscray with 17.8 (110).\n\nSo the claim's assertion that Richmond scored 19.21 isn't supported by this table. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where Richmond plays Footscray, but looking at the table, it seems like this is the only game between those two teams on that date (29 April 1939). There's no other row with Richmond vs Footscray. So my conclusion stands: the claim is false because Richmond scored 20.19 in that game, not 19.21.\n\nNow, I need to map out which cells are relevant for verification. The relevant cells would be the ones containing the information about the specific game between Richmond and Footscray. That includes the home team (Richmond), away team (Footscray), and their respective scores.\n\nSo the columns involved are \"home team\", \"away team\", \"home team score\", and \"away team score\". The row index for this particular game is 3, as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Richmond scored 19.21 against Footscray, but according to the table, Richmond's score in that game was 20.19. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "all the vfl game play on april 29 1939 have more than 17000 crowd in attendance",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the VFL games is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"All the VFL game play on April 29, 1939 have more than 17000 crowd in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game.\n\nThe key points of the claim are:\n1. The games occurred on April 29, 1939.\n2. Each game had more than 17000 attendees.\n\nLooking at the table, all the dates in the 'date' column are \"29 april 1939.\" So that part matches\u2014each listed game was indeed played on April 29, 1939.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'crowd' column for each of these games. The claim says that all games had more than 17000 people attending. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **First row**: Crowd is 11000. That's less than 17000.\n2. **Second row**: Crowd is 15000. Also less than 17000.\n3. **Third row**: Crowd is 20000. This is more than 17000.\n4. **Fourth row**: Crowd is 26000. More than 17000.\n5. **Fifth row**: Crowd is 17000. Hmm, exactly 17000. The claim says \"more than 17000,\" which means strictly greater than 17,000. So this one is not more.\n6. **Sixth row**: Crowd is 15000 again. Also less.\n\nSo out of the six games listed on April 29, 1939, four had crowds over 17,000, two were exactly or below that number (11000 and 15000). \n\nTherefore, not all games met the criteria stated in the claim. Since at least one game (south melbourne vs collingwood) didn't have more than 17000 attendees, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The 'crowd' column is directly related because it shows the number of attendees for each game. So I need to list all rows where this column is present. That would be all six games, but perhaps focusing on those that don't meet the criteria. However, according to the instructions, I should list all relevant cells regardless of their values.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells will include every row's 'crowd' data because each one needs to be checked against the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because not all games had more than 17000 attendees; some had exactly or less. The relevant cells are all 'crowd' entries as they determine the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
