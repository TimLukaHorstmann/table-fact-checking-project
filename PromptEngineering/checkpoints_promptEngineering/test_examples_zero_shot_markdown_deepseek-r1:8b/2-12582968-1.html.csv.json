    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich complete in the olympic game 2 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It says that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich completed in the Olympic Games twice. So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that he participated in two different Olympics.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a competition with details like the year, competition name, venue, position, and notes. The key columns here are \"year\" and \"competition,\" especially since the claim is about Olympic Games participation over multiple years.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to see which ones mention the Olympics or related competitions. \n\n- 1998: world junior championships\n- 1999: European junior championships\n- 2001: European U23 championships\n- 2003: Universiade (which is a multi-sport event, not specifically Olympic Games)\n- 2005: World championships\n- 2006: European championships\n- 2008: Olympic Games in Beijing\n- 2009: World championships\n- 2012: Olympic Games in London\n- 2013: World championships\n\nFrom this, the rows that mention \"Olympic Games\" are 2008 and 2012. That's two separate Olympics, so it seems like Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich did participate twice.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any possibility of another Olympic participation not listed here or if the same person could have participated in more than two. But based on the table provided, only two entries are for the Olympic Games: 2008 and 2012. \n\nNow, regarding the note about the position, it shows that in 2008 he was 29th, and in 2012, he was 6th. The claim doesn't specify the positions, just participation, so this is irrelevant here.\n\nPutting it all together, since there are two Olympic Games entries for Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich in 2008 and 2012, the claim stating that he completed in the Olympics twice seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Olympic Games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Olympic Games\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich place third place or higher in 1 competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It says that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich placed third place or higher in one competition. So, I'm looking for at least one instance where his position is third or better (i.e., 1st, 2nd, or 3rd).\n\nNow, I should look through each row of the table to check if there's any occurrence where \"position\" is 3rd or higher. Let me go through each year and see:\n\n- **1998**: Position is 10th \u2192 Not third or higher.\n- **1999**: Position is 5th \u2192 Not third or higher.\n- **2001**: Position is 11th \u2192 No.\n- **2003**: Position is 4th \u2192 Close, but it's not third. It's actually better than fourth, but the claim specifies \"third place or higher,\" so 4th doesn't qualify as higher than third. Wait, no\u2014actually, if someone places 3rd, that's equal to third place. So, positions are integers here. If position is 4th, it's lower than third. So 4th doesn't count.\n- **2005**: 14th \u2192 No.\n- **2006**: 15th \u2192 No.\n- **2008**: 29th \u2192 No.\n- **2009**: 14th \u2192 No.\n- **2012**: 6th \u2192 No.\n- **2013**: 3rd \u2192 Yes! Here's the one.\n\nSo, in 2013, Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich placed 3rd. That meets the condition of being third place or higher (since it's exactly third). Therefore, there is at least one competition where he achieved this.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting \"third place or higher\" correctly. If someone places first, that's definitely higher than third. Second as well. Third is equal to third, so yes, it counts. Fourth and below don't. So in 2003, position was 4th, which doesn't count towards meeting the claim.\n\nTherefore, looking at all positions, only 2013 has a 3rd place finish, satisfying the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are for the row where Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich placed third in the 2013 World Championships. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the competition type be a junior championship 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim means. It seems like it's saying that the competition type is a \"junior championship\" twice in the table. So I need to look through each row and see how many times the competition type is listed as a junior championship.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'competition' column. Let me go through each one:\n\n1. 1998: world junior championships \u2014 this is a junior championship.\n2. 1999: european junior championships \u2014 also a junior championship.\n3. 2001: european u23 championships \u2014 not a junior championship, it's U23.\n4. 2003: universiade \u2014 this isn't specified as a junior championship.\n5. 2005: world championships \u2014 not specifically mentioned as a junior competition.\n6. 2006: european championships \u2014 same as above.\n7. 2008: olympic games \u2014 definitely not a junior championship.\n8. 2009: world championships \u2014 again, not specified as junior.\n9. 2012: olympic games \u2014 same as 2008.\n10. 2013: world championships \u2014 no mention of being a junior competition.\n\nSo, looking at the 'competition' column, the first two rows are indeed 'junior championships.' That's two instances. The claim says \"the competition type be a junior championship 2 time,\" which matches these two entries. \n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are exactly two times where the competition type is a junior championship in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each row's 'competition' column for the term \"junior championship.\" The first two rows (1998 and 1999) match this criterion, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim \"4 of the competition out of 10 be world wide championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the table lists various competitions, their venues, positions, and notes for different years from 1998 to 2013. The claim mentions \"4 of the competition out of 10 be world wide championship.\" So I think it's saying that among the competitions listed in the table, 4 of them are \"world wide championships.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'competition' column which seems to specify the type of competition. For example, rows have entries like \"world junior championships,\" \" european junior championships,\" \"universiade,\" and so on.\n\nI need to identify how many times \"world wide championship\" appears in the 'competition' column. But wait, I don't see that exact phrase in the table. The closest I see is \"world championships.\" There are entries like \"world junior championships,\" which might be a subcategory, but not exactly \"world wide championship.\"\n\nSo perhaps the claim is misphrased or refers to \"world championships\" as being considered \"world wide championships.\" Alternatively, maybe it's about the position of the competitors. Let me check that angle.\n\nThe claim could also mean that in 4 out of 10 cases, competitors achieved a certain position, like finishing in the top 10, but the wording is unclear. It might be referring to the number of competitions that are \"world wide championships,\" not positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about how many times a specific competition type occurs. So let me count the occurrences where 'competition' is something related to world championships.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1998: world junior championships\n- 1999: european junior championships\n- 2001: european u23 championships\n- 2003: universiade\n- 2005: world championships\n- 2006: european championships\n- 2008: olympic games\n- 2009: world championships\n- 2012: olympic games\n- 2013: world championships\n\nSo in this table, the 'competition' column has \"world championships\" appearing three times (in 2005, 2009, and 2013). The rest are different types like European championships or junior ones.\n\nThe claim says that 4 of the competitions out of 10 are \"world wide championship,\" but according to this table, it's only three. So maybe the count is off by one. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting what counts as a \"world wide championship.\"\n\nWait, the term \"world wide\" might not exactly match any column in the table. The 'notes' column sometimes has distances, like 61.51 m, which probably refers to track and field events. But that's about performance, not the competition type.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to how many times a particular position was achieved. For instance, if \"world wide championship\" implies a certain rank, but looking at the 'position' column, it varies from 10th to 3rd across different competitions. So that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the venues are considered \"world wide,\" but that doesn't make much sense because they all have specific locations like cities and countries. For example, venues include places like Annecy, Riga, Amsterdam, etc., which aren't specifically tied to being worldwide competitions beyond their names.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about how many times a competitor achieved a certain position, but in that case, it would be based on the 'position' column. Let me check if four of them are 14th or something specific.\n\nLooking at the 'position' column:\n\n- 1998: 10th\n- 1999: 5th\n- 2001: 11th\n- 2003: 4th\n- 2005: 14th\n- 2006: 15th\n- 2008: 29th\n- 2009: 14th\n- 2012: 6th\n- 2013: 3rd\n\nSo the positions vary. The position \"14th\" appears twice (2005 and 2009). That's not four times, so maybe the claim is about something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a misstatement and they meant that 4 out of 10 rows have a specific characteristic. Maybe the 'notes' column has a certain pattern. Let me check:\n\n- 61.51 m\n- 64.20 m\n- 66.41 m\n- 71.26 m\n- 74.53 m\n- 73.77 m\n- 70.56 m\n- 74.47 m\n- 77.17 m\n- 79.36 m\n\nThese look like track and field event distances, possibly shot put or similar. There's no indication that four of them are \"world wide championship\" related.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the claim refers to how many times a specific competition type is present. If \"world championships\" appear three times in the 'competition' column, but the claim says 4 out of 10, then it would be FALSE because there's only three instances.\n\nAlternatively, if the count includes both \"world championships\" and \"olympic games,\" but that doesn't make sense as they're different types.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in phrasing. The table shows competitions like \"world junior championships,\" which are not the same as \"world championships.\" So perhaps the claim is inaccurate because only three rows have \"world championships\" in their competition name, not four.\n\nTherefore, the claim that 4 out of 10 competitions are world wide championships would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 4 out of 10 competitions listed in the table are \"world wide championships.\" Upon examining the 'competition' column, only three entries specifically mention \"world championships\" (2005, 2009, and 2013). There's no indication that any other competition type is being referred to as a \"world wide championship.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's last two competitions is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"in luk\u00e1\u0161 melich 's last 2 competition he throw an average distance of 78.27 m\". So, I need to check if in his last two competitions, his average throw was around 78.27 meters.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows correspond to Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's competitions. Looking at the table, the years are from 1998 to 2013, and each row has a competition name. But wait, the first column is \"year\", so I need to see if any of these entries are for Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I realize that the table might not list all competitors, but perhaps it's specific to someone named Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich. Wait, no, the user provided a table with various competitions and positions, but maybe it's not directly about Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim is about \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\", so I need to check if he participated in two competitions in the last two years listed. But looking at the table, the latest year is 2013. So his last two competitions would be from 2012 and 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, for 2012, the competition was the Olympic Games in London, where he placed 6th with a distance of 77.17 m. For 2013, it's the World Championships in Moscow, where he placed 3rd with a throw of 79.36 m.\n\nNow, to find his average over these two competitions: (77.17 + 79.36) / 2 = 156.53 / 2 = 78.26 meters. The claim says an average of 78.27 m, which is very close but not exact. However, the table has precise numbers, so maybe it's rounded or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. 77.17 + 79.36 equals... 77.17 + 79 = 156.17, plus 0.36 is 156.53. Divided by 2 is indeed 78.26 meters. The claim says 78.27 m, which is just a thousandth off. Considering possible rounding in the data, maybe it's acceptable to consider them equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look at other competitions where he placed higher or lower. Wait, but the claim specifies \"last two competition\", so only 2012 and 2013 are relevant.\n\nSo, his positions were 6th and 3rd, which are decent, but maybe the distances average to around 78.27 m. So the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It mentions \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" winning a medal at the \"olympic game.\" So I need to check if there's any entry in the table that matches this information.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: year, competition, venue, position, and notes. The position column seems to indicate where Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich finished in various competitions. For example, in 1998, he was 10th, which probably means he didn't win a medal but participated.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row to see if there's any mention of him winning a medal. Wait, actually, the table lists competitions and their positions. So, for instance, in 2012, he was at position 6th in the Olympic Games. Since 1st place is usually a medal, being 6th doesn't qualify. Similarly, other years show positions that aren't 1st, so no medals there.\n\nNow, considering the claim specifically mentions \"olympic game.\" Looking for rows where the competition is Olympic Games. From the table, in 2008 and 2012, the competition is listed as \"olympic games\" with positions 29th and 6th respectively. Neither of these are first place, so no medals.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim is about Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich winning a medal at an Olympic Game. Since he didn't finish in 1st place in any Olympic Games, according to the table, he hasn't won a medal there. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each relevant row:\n\n- 1998: world junior championships, 10th\n- 2003: Universiade, 4th\n- 2005: World Championships, 14th\n- 2006: European Championships, 15th\n- 2008: Olympic Games, 29th\n- 2012: Olympic Games, 6th\n- 2013: World Championships, 3rd\n\nIn 2013, he came in 3rd at the World Championships. That's a medal position (third place is a bronze medal). But that's not an Olympic Game; it's a different competition.\n\nSo, focusing back on the claim about \"olympic game,\" there's no row where Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich finished first in an Olympic Games. Therefore, he hasn't won a medal at the Olympics as per this table.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich won a medal at the Olympic Games.

Let me look at the instructions carefully. \n\nFirst, the table lists various competitions, venues, positions, and notes for each year from 1998 to 2013. The claim mentions \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich,\" so I should check if he's involved in any of these competitions.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. Starting with 1998: it says the competition is world junior championships in Annecy, France, position 10th, and notes 61.51 m. The name doesn't seem to match \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich,\" so I can probably skip this.\n\nNext, 1999: European junior championships in Riga, Latvia, position 5th, note 64.20 m. Again, no mention of Luk\u00e1\u0161 here.\n\n2001: European U23 championships in Amsterdam, Netherlands, position 11th, note 66.41 m.

No match here either.\n\n2009: World championships in Berlin, Germany, position 14th, note 74.47 m. Not him.\n\n2012: Olympic games in London, Great Britain, position 6th, note 77.17 m. Still not matching.\n\n2013: World championships in Moscow, Russia, position 3rd, note 79.36 m. Now, this seems relevant because the position is 3rd. But the claim says \"best finish is second.\" Wait, maybe I need to check if there's any row where he placed second.\n\nWait a minute, looking at each year: In 2013, his position was 3rd. So he didn't place second here. Are there any other rows? Let me double-check all the positions:\n\n1998 - 10th\n1999 - 5th\n2001 - 11th\n2003 - 4th\n2005 -14th\n2006 -15th\n2008 -29th\n2009 -14th\n2012 -6th\n2013 -3rd\n\nNone of these positions are second. So, based on the table provided, Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich never finished second in any of the listed competitions.\n\nTherefore, the claim that his best finish is second is FALSE because there's no evidence of him placing second in the given data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's best finish is second\" is true or false, I need to examine each row of the provided table for any occurrence where his position was second. \n\nUpon reviewing all the positions listed in the table, none of them indicate that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich finished in second place. Therefore, the claim does not hold.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's highest finish as a junior\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich achieved his best (highest) position in a junior competition at some point. So, I'm looking for entries where \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\" is listed as the competitor, specifically in a junior category, and their position is higher than any other positions he achieved in other competitions.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- The columns are year, competition type, venue, position, and notes.\n- The rows represent different years from 1998 to 2013.\n\nNow, I need to see if \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\" is mentioned anywhere. Scanning through the 'notes' column first because it's where names might be listed without being a direct competitor. However, in this table, all notes seem to refer to distances (e.g., 61.51 m) rather than competitors.\n\nNext, I'll check each row's competition name for any mention of \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\". If he isn't listed as a participant in any competition here, the claim might be false.\n\nBut wait, actually, looking at the 'position' column values: They are 10th, 5th, 11th, etc. These positions are for the competitors in each event. So, if \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\" was part of a junior category, his position would reflect his performance there.\n\nSince I don't see any entries with \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\" as a competitor or even mentioned in the notes, it's possible that he hasn't participated in these events listed. Therefore, there's no data to support the claim that he achieved a highest finish as a junior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe his name is not directly in the table, but perhaps another row refers to him indirectly. However, given that I don't find any direct or indirect mention of his name in the provided columns, it seems like the claim isn't supported by the data presented.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\" is a competitor not listed here, but the table doesn't provide information about him. If he's not present, then his highest finish as a junior can't be verified from this table, making the claim false.\n\nSo, after reviewing each row and column, there's no relevant data supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various competitions, years, venues, positions, and notes. The claim is saying that \"4 of the competition be senior world championship\". Hmm, I need to check if that's true.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It seems like it's asserting that there are four entries in the 'competition' column where the event is called the \"senior world championship\". So I need to look through each row and count how many times \"world championships\" appears in the competition name, especially if it's specified as \"senior\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1998: world junior championships\n- 1999: european junior championships\n- 2001: european u23 championships\n- 2003: universiade\n- 2005: world championships\n- 2006: european championships\n- 2008: olympic games\n- 2009: world championships\n- 2012: olympic games\n- 2013: world championships\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the 'competition' column. Let me list them out again:\n\n1. world junior championships \u2013 not senior\n2. european junior championships \u2013 not senior\n3. european u23 championships \u2013 not senior\n4. universiade \u2013 varies, but here it's a multi-sport event, not specifically senior world championship\n5. world championships \u2013 this is the main one, but doesn't specify senior\n6. european championships \u2013 not senior\n7. olympic games \u2013 not specifically senior world championship\n8. world championships again \u2013 same as entry 5\n9. olympic games again \u2013 same as entry 7\n10. world championships once more \u2013 same as entries 5 and 8\n\nWait, so \"world championships\" without the word \"senior\" in it. The claim says \"senior world championship\", which implies that 'competition' column should say \"senior world championships\". But looking at the table, none of the competition names have \"senior\" in them. They either specify junior, u23, or just \"world championships\".\n\nSo, are there four instances where the competition is \"senior world championships\"? From what I can see, no. There's only one entry for \"world championships\", which is in 2005, 2009, and 2013. That's three times, not four.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count again:\n\n- 1998: world junior\n- 1999: european junior\n- 2001: european u23\n- 2003: universiade\n- 2005: world championships\n- 2006: european\n- 2008: olympic\n- 2009: world championships\n- 2012: olympic\n- 2013: world championships\n\nSo \"world championships\" appears in 2005, 2009, and 2013. That's three times. None of them mention \"senior\". Therefore, the claim is saying that four competitions are senior world championships, but there are only three entries where it's called \"world championships\", regardless of senior status.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The 'competition' column might have variations. Let me check if any row has \"senior world championships\" as the competition name. Scanning through, no. All the competitions either specify junior, u23, or just \"world championships\" without the senior part.\n\nSo, there are zero entries where the competition is \"senior world championships\". Therefore, the claim that four of them are senior world championship is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that there are four competitions listed as \"senior world championships.\" Upon reviewing the table, none of the competition entries specify \"senior world championships.\" Instead, three entries refer to \"world championships\" without specifying senior status. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich never throw for greater than 78 m\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim seems to state that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's throwing distance was never more than 78 meters in any of the competitions listed in the table. So, I need to check all the entries in the \"position\" column and see if any of them exceed 78 meters.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different competition, with columns for year, competition name, venue, position, and notes. The \"notes\" column lists distances, presumably in meters since they're numbers without units indicated.\n\nI should go through each row and check the \"position\" column because it might indicate rank, but wait\u2014no, actually, looking closer, the \"position\" column shows ranks like 10th, 5th, etc., which likely refers to their placement in the competition. The actual throwing distance is in the \"notes\" column.\n\nSo, for each row, I need to extract the value from the \"notes\" column and see if it's greater than 78 meters.\n\nLet me list out all the notes:\n\n- 1998: 61.51 m\n- 1999: 64.20 m\n- 2001: 66.41 m\n- 2003: 71.26 m\n- 2005: 74.53 m\n- 2006: 73.77 m\n- 2008: 70.56 m\n- 2009: 74.47 m\n- 2012: 77.17 m\n- 2013: 79.36 m\n\nNow, checking each of these:\n\n1998: 61.51 <78 \u2192 OK\n1999:64.20<78\u2192OK\n2001:66.41<78\u2192OK\n2003:71.26<78\u2192OK\n2005:74.53<78\u2192OK\n2006:73.77<78\u2192OK\n2008:70.56<78\u2192OK\n2009:74.47<78\u2192OK\n2012:77.17<78\u2192OK\n2013:79.36>78\u2192This one is over.\n\nSo, in 2013, the distance was 79.36 m, which is greater than 78 m. That means the claim that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich never threw for greater than 78 m is false because there's at least one instance where he exceeded that distance.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if \"position\" and \"notes\" are correctly aligned. Looking back, yes, each row has a \"position\" which is their rank, and the \"notes\" column has the throwing distance. So my initial assessment stands.\n\nTherefore, since there's one instance where he threw over 78 m, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in 2013, Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich threw 79.36 meters, exceeding 78 meters.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"notes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
