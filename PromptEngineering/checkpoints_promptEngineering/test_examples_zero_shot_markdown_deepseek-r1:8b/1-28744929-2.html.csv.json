    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ralph friedgen coach for 10 year at maryland\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in markdown format. Each row represents a different team with details like the team name, head coach, years at school, overall record, and their records in certain categories like conference (acc) and school (record at school). The claim mentions Ralph Friedgen as a coach who has been at Maryland for 10 years.\n\nI'll need to find Ralph Friedgen's entry in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Boston College**: Coach is Frank Spaziani, not Ralph Friedgen.\n2. **Clemson**: Coach is Dabo Swinney.\n3. **Duke**: Coach is David Cutcliffe.\n4. **Florida State**: Coach is Jimbo Fisher.\n5. **Georgia Tech**: Coach is Paul Johnson.\n6. **Maryland**: The coach here is Ralph Friedgen, so this row is relevant for the claim since it's about his tenure at Maryland.\n7. **Miami**: Coach is Randy Shannon.\n8. **North Carolina**: Coach is Butch Davis.\n9. **NC State**: Coach is Tom O'Brien.\n10. **Virginia**: Coach is Mike London.\n11. **Virginia Tech**: Coach is Frank Beamer.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Ralph Friedgen is indeed the coach for Maryland. Now, I need to check two main points from the claim: the duration he was at Maryland and whether it's 10 years.\n\nLooking at the \"years at school\" column for Maryland (row index 6), it shows 10 years. That matches the claim stating he was there for 10 years.\n\nAdditionally, I should verify that the claim correctly attributes his tenure to Maryland. The table confirms he is associated with Maryland and not any other team.\n\nTherefore, both aspects of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"head coach\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"years at school\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"miami have a 11 - 13 atlantic cost conference record.\" Hmm, wait, I think they mean Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), not \"cost\" as in expense. That might be a typo, but I'll proceed with ACC since that's what the table has under \"acc record.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: team, head coach, years at school, overall record, record at school, and acc record. Each row represents a different college or university.\n\nFirst, I need to find Miami in the table. Scanning down, yes, there's a row for miami. Let me check that row.\n\nIn the miami row, the head coach is randy shannon, they've been at school for 4 years. The overall record is 21-17. Record at school is also 21-17, and ACC record is 11-13.\n\nWait, so according to this, Miami's ACC record is 11-13. That matches the claim exactly. So the claim says they have an 11-13 conference record, which is in the table as \"acc record.\" Therefore, it should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this. Looking at the miami row, specifically the \"acc record\" column. That's important because it directly states their ACC performance. Also, maybe the overall and school records could be considered for context, but the key one is the ACC record cell.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include both the row index (which I need to find) and the column name \"acc record.\"\n\nLet me count the rows starting from 0. boston college is 0, clemson 1, duke 2, florida state 3, georgia tech 4, maryland 5, miami 6, north carolina 7, nc state 8, virginia 9, virginia tech 10.\n\nSo, miami is row index 6. Therefore, the relevant cells are for row 6 and column \"acc record.\"\n\nWait, but in the example given, they included two cells, but here it's just one. So I should include only the acc record cell, right? Because that's where the claim is validated.\n\nSo, to sum up: The miami team has an ACC record of 11-13 as per the table, so the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell is row 6, column \"acc record.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"acc record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "frank beamer coach his team to a 229 - 115 - 4 record",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"frank beamer coach his team to a 229 - 115 - 4 record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: team, head coach, years at school, overall record, record at school, and acc record. Each row represents a different team with their respective information.\n\nThe claim mentions \"frank beamer\" as the coach. So my first step is to identify which row corresponds to Frank Beamer. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: boston college\n- Row 1: clemson\n- Row 2: duke\n- Row 3: florida state\n- Row 4: georgia tech\n- Row 5: maryland\n- Row 6: miami\n- Row 7: north carolina\n- Row 8: nc state\n- Row 9: virginia\n- Row 10: virginia tech\n\nLooking at the 'head coach' column, row 10 has \"frank beamer\". So that's the relevant row.\n\nNext, the claim mentions a specific overall record: 229 - 115 - 4. I need to check if this matches the 'overall record' for Frank Beamer's team in the table.\n\nIn row 10, under 'overall record', it says \"229 - 115 - 4\". That exactly matches the number mentioned in the claim. So that seems correct at first glance.\n\nHowever, I should also consider whether there are any other aspects to this claim. The term \"coach his team\" might imply that Frank Beamer was the head coach during those years and led the team to that record. From the table, he's been at Virginia Tech for 24 years, which likely covers the period when this record would have been achieved.\n\nLooking at the 'years at school' column for row 10: it shows 24. This suggests that Frank Beamer has been with Virginia Tech for 24 years, so it's plausible that he led them to a 229 - 115 - 4 overall record over those years.\n\nWait, but I should check if the overall record is accurately presented in the table. The 'overall record' is listed as \"229 - 115 - 4\". That seems like wins-loss-tie or something similar, but typically records are just wins and losses, not including ties unless specified. However, in this context, it's probably acceptable.\n\nAnother point: the claim says \"frank beamer coach his team to a 229 - 115 - 4 record.\" The table shows that Virginia Tech has an overall record of 229 - 115 - 4, so that part is correct.\n\nI also need to ensure that there are no discrepancies or errors in the table itself. For example, if Frank Beamer's overall record was different, but from what I can see, it matches.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim accurately references the overall record for Frank Beamer's team as 229 - 115 - 4, which is directly supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"tom o'brien who have 3 year at school of nc state have a record of 16 - 21 with acc record 11 - 13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for Tom O'Brien in the 'NC State' row. Looking at the table, NC State's head coach is Tom O'Brien. The years at school column has a value, but it seems to be a number without any units, possibly indicating 3 years as per the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check the overall record and ACC record for NC State. The overall record is listed as 91-66. Hmm, that doesn't match the 16-21 in the claim. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the claim refers to something else.\n\nLooking again, the claim mentions \"3 years at school,\" so the 'years at school' column for NC State should be 3. That's correct, as per the table. \n\nNow, the record: the overall is 91-66, not 16-21. The ACC record is 9-15, which also doesn't match 11-13. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I misread the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is talking about Tom O'Brien when he was at NC State with a 3-year term. So, in that period, did he have a specific record? The table shows overall as 91-66 and ACC as 9-15, which are different from what's claimed (16-21 and 11-13). So that would make the claim FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each relevant cell. For NC State:\n\n- team: nc state\n- head coach: tom o'brien\n- years at school: 4 (not 3 as claimed)\n- overall record: 91-66\n- record at school: 16-21? Wait, looking back, the 'record at school' column for NC State is 16-21. So that's correct.\n\nThe ACC record is listed as 9-15, not 11-13. That seems incorrect. So Tom O'Brien had a record of 16-21 at NC State but with an ACC record of 9-15, not 11-13 as the claim states. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the ACC record doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the table, under 'acc record' for NC State, it's 9-15. So the claim says 11-13, which is wrong. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years at school\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"acc record\"}]}",

The claim is: \"randy shannon of maryland team who have acc record of 12 - 4 have 1 year at school.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions three main things: the person (Randy Shannon), their team (Maryland), the ACC record (12-4), and the number of years they've been at the school (1 year). \n\nI'll start by looking for Randy Shannon in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that the head coach column lists several names, and on the second to last row, under \"miami,\" it says \"randy shannon.\" So, Randy Shannon is the head coach of the Miami team.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to him as being part of the Maryland team. That's a discrepancy already. If he's coaching Miami, then he can't be coaching Maryland at the same time. So that might make the claim FALSE because he's not associated with Maryland. But I need to check all parts to be thorough.\n\nNext, let me look for the ACC record of 12-4. In the \"acc record\" column, I see that Georgia Tech has a 12-4 record. So the team with an ACC record of 12-4 is Georgia Tech, not Maryland or any other mentioned in the claim except Miami.\n\nWait, but the claim says Randy Shannon of the Maryland team has an ACC record of 12-4. But according to the table, Randy Shannon is coaching Miami, and their ACC record is listed as 11-13. So that doesn't match 12-4 either. Georgia Tech's coach, Paul Johnson, has a better record.\n\nFurthermore, looking at how long Randy Shannon has been at Miami, it says he's been there for 4 years. The claim states he has 1 year at school, which is not correct. \n\nSo putting it all together: the person mentioned in the claim (Randy Shannon) isn't with Maryland, his team's ACC record isn't 12-4, and he hasn't been at his current school for just one year. Therefore, the claim has multiple inaccuracies, making it FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"acc record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various college football teams, their head coaches, the number of years the coach has been at the school, and some records. The claim is: \"butch davis be the coach of miami when they have a acc record of 11 - 13 with 3 year at school.\"\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which parts of this claim correspond to cells in the table. Let me break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions \"butch davis\" as the coach, so I should look for that in the \"head coach\" column. The teams are listed in the first column, so I need to see if \"miami\" is a team. Looking at the table, yes, there's a row for miami.\n\nNext, the claim talks about an ACC record of 11-13. So I should check the \"acc record\" column for miami. From the table, under \"acc record,\" miami has 11-13.\n\nThen, it mentions \"3 year at school.\" That refers to the number of years the coach has been at the school. In the \"years at school\" column for miami, I see that the value is 4, but wait, no, looking again, under \"years at school,\" miami's row says 4? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the table shows each row with team name, head coach, years at school, overall record, etc. For miami, it's listed as:\n\n| miami          | randy shannon   |                 4 | 21 - 17          | 21 - 17            | 11 - 13      |\n\nWait, so the \"years at school\" for miami is 4. But the claim says \"3 year at school.\" That's a discrepancy. So if the claim states that the coach has been there for 3 years but according to the table, it's actually 4 years, then the claim would be false because the number of years doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row. The first column is team names: boston college, clemson, duke, florida state, georgia tech, maryland, miami, north carolina, nc state, virginia, virginia tech.\n\nLooking at the \"years at school\" column:\n\n- boston college: 3\n- clemson: 3\n- duke: 3\n- florida state:1\n- georgia tech:3\n- maryland:10\n- miami:4\n- north carolina:4\n- nc state:4\n- virginia:1\n- virginia tech:24\n\nSo yes, miami has 4 years at school under coach randy shannon. The claim says \"3 year,\" which is different.\n\nBut the claim also states that butch davis is the coach of miami. Looking at the table, for the team miami, the head coach is randy shannon, not butch davis. So that's another inconsistency.\n\nWait, so the claim has two parts: butch davis being the coach and having 3 years at school with an ACC record of 11-13. But in reality, it's randy shannon who is the coach for miami with 4 years and an ACC record of 11-13, which partially matches except for the head coach.\n\nSo to verify the claim: are there cells that fully support all parts? The claim requires three things: the coach's name, the team name, the number of years, the ACC record. But in the table, miami has a different coach and a slightly different year count. So none of these conditions are fully met.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the head coach doesn't match (it's randy shannon, not butch davis), and the number of years at school is 4 instead of 3 as stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"butch davis\" is the coach of miami with an ACC record of 11-13 and 3 years at school. However:\n\n1. **Team**: The table confirms \"miami\" is a team.\n2. **ACC Record**: The table shows miami's ACC record as 11-13, matching the claim.\n3. **Years at School**: The table states 4 years, not 3.\n4. **Head Coach**: The head coach for miami is randy shannon, not butch davis.\n\nSince both the head coach and years at school do not match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"head coach\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"years at school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"acc record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"Frank Beamer headcoach of NC State have overall record of 71 - 38 with 4 year in school.\" \n\nI'll need to verify each part of this claim against the table. The key points are:\n\n1. Frank Beamer is the head coach of NC State.\n2. His overall record is 71 - 38.\n3. He has been at the school for 4 years.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on the 'team', 'head coach', and relevant columns like 'overall record' and 'years at school'.\n\nStarting with the team: The claim mentions NC State, so I'll look for that in the 'team' column. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- boston college\n- clemson\n- duke\n- florida state\n- georgia tech\n- maryland\n- miami\n- north carolina\n- nc state\n- virginia\n- virginia tech\n\nYes, NC State is row 8.\n\nNext, the head coach: The claim says Frank Beamer. Looking at the 'head coach' column for NC State:\n\nFrom the table, under 'head coach' for NC State (row 8) it's \"tom o'brien\". That doesn't match Frank Beamer. Wait, that can't be right because I know Frank Beamer is a well-known coach, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again. The table shows:\n\n| nc state       | tom o'brien     | ... etc. \n\nYes, it says Tom O'Brien as the head coach for NC State, not Frank Beamer. That means the claim might be incorrect already because the head coach doesn't match.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other parts. His overall record is stated as 71 - 38. Looking at the 'overall record' column for NC State:\n\nThe table shows \"71 - 38\" for NC State (row 8). That matches the claim.\n\nNow, years at school: The claim says 4 years. The 'years at school' column for NC State is 4. So that part checks out as well.\n\nHowever, since the head coach doesn't match Frank Beamer but Tom O'Brien, the first part of the claim is false.

However, upon checking the table:\n\n1. **Head Coach**: The table lists Tom O'Brien for NC State, not Frank Beamer.\n2. **Overall Record and Years at School**: These match the claim.\n\nSince the head coach doesn't align with the claim, it's false despite correct stats elsewhere.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"head coach\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"overall record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"years at school\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
