The claim is: \"the street address for the prudential tower building be 800 boylston street.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: name, street address, years as tallest, height ft (m), and floors. Each row represents a different building.\n\nI need to locate the \"prudential tower\" in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. old state house - not relevant\n2. old north church - nope\n3. park street church - nope\n4. church of the covenant - nope\n5. custom house tower - nope\n6. prudential tower - yes, this is the building in question\n7. hancock place - not relevant\n\nSo the row for \"prudential tower\" is row index 6 (since we start counting from 0). Now, looking at the columns for this row:\n\n- name: prudential tower\n- street address: 800 boylston street\n- years as tallest: 1964 - 1976\n- height ft (m): 04.0 749 (228)\n- floors: 52\n\nThe claim is about the street address of the prudential tower being \"800 boylston street.\" From the table, that's exactly what's listed under \"street address\" for row index 6. \n\nSo, checking each relevant cell, the street address column in row 6 matches the claim.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it says that the Custom House Tower has thirty-two floors. So I need to check the number of floors listed for the Custom House Tower in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different building with various details. The column names are name, street address, years as tallest, height ft (m), and floors. \n\nNow, I'll locate the Custom House Tower in the table. Scanning down, I see that it's the fifth row. Let me double-check that: yes, \"custom house tower\" is there with the street address 3 mckinley square.\n\nNext, I need to focus on the \"floors\" column for this particular building. The value listed under floors is 32, right? So according to the table, Custom House Tower does have thirty-two floors.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"thirty - 2 floor.\" That could be interpreted in two ways: either it's a typo and meant to say \"thirty-two,\" or maybe it's referring to something else. But given the context, it's clearly about the number of floors in the building.\n\nIn the table, the Custom House Tower is listed with 32 floors. So the claim seems to be stating that it has thirty-two floors. Therefore, the statement should be TRUE because the number matches what's in the table.\n\nI should also make sure I'm looking at the correct columns and rows. The row index for \"custom house tower\" is probably 5 since the list starts at 0 or maybe 4 if starting at 1. Wait, looking back at the example JSON provided, the relevant cells are listed with row_index as integers. Let me check the table again.\n\nThe first row (index 0) is old state house, then old north church (1), park street church (2), church of the covenant (3), custom house tower (4), prudential tower (5), hancock place (6). So \"custom house tower\" is at row_index 4.\n\nThe columns are name, street address, years as tallest, height ft (m), and floors. The claim refers to floors, so I need to check the \"floors\" column for Custom House Tower.\n\nYes, it's 32.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the building on 800 boylston street have fifty - 2 floor.\" Wait, that seems a bit confusing. The user probably means the building at 800 Boylston Street has 52 floors because in the table, the Prudential Tower is listed with 52 floors.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row corresponds to a specific building with details like name, address, years as tallest, height in feet (with both imperial and metric measurements), and number of floors. The relevant information for the claim is about the number of floors, so I should focus on that column.\n\nNext, I need to locate the entry for 800 Boylston Street. Scanning through the table, there's a row with \"prudential tower\" at address \"800 boylston street.\" Let me check the other columns: years as tallest is 1964 - 1976, height ft (m) is 04.0 749 (228), and floors are 52. So, yes, it has 52 floors.\n\nThe claim mentions fifty-2 floor, which I think is a typo for 52 floors. The table confirms that the Prudential Tower on 800 Boylston Street has 52 floors. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: the \"floors\" column is key here. Also, the \"street address\" and perhaps the building's name might be used for verification, but since the claim specifically refers to the street address, I need to include that as well.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- row index 5 (since it's the 6th entry starting from 0), column_name \"floors\".\n- Also, possibly row index 5, column_name \"street address\" because the claim references the address.\n- Additionally, maybe row index 5, column_name \"name\" as it confirms the building is Prudential Tower.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to include each relevant cell that was used to verify. So, perhaps all three are needed: name, street address, and floors columns because they collectively confirm the claim.\n\nBut let me think again. The claim mentions the specific building on 800 Boylston Street. So, the street address is part of verifying which building it refers to. Then, once identified, checking the floors column is necessary. Also, perhaps confirming the name aligns with Prudential Tower, but maybe that's implied by the address.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim directly states the number of floors, only the \"floors\" column is relevant for that part of the claim. However, to fully verify, we might also need the street address and possibly the building name to ensure it's the correct building.\n\nBut looking at the example given in the instructions, they include two cells: one from Revenue and another from Employees. So, perhaps each piece of information needed is a separate cell.\n\nIn this case, the claim requires verifying three things:\n1. The building is on 800 Boylston Street.\n2. It has 52 floors.\n\nSo, I need to check both street address and floors columns for that row.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both \"street address\" and \"floors\" from row index 5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we verify the number of floors for the building at 800 Boylston Street.

Each row represents a different building with their respective details.\n\nThe claim in question is about the \"prudential tower\" having 52 floors. So my first task is to locate the relevant row in the table that corresponds to the Prudential Tower.\n\nLooking at the 'name' column, I see:\n- old state house\n- old north church\n- park street church\n- church of the covenant\n- custom house tower\n- prudential tower\n- hancock place\n\nYes, there's a row for \"prudential tower.\" So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, the claim is about the number of floors. I need to check the 'floors' column for this specific building. Let me find the corresponding data.\n\nThe 'prudential tower' row has the following details:\n- name: prudential tower\n- street address: 800 boylston street\n- years as tallest: 1964 - 1976\n- height ft (m): 04.0 749 (228)\n- floors: 52\n\nSo, according to this data, the Prudential Tower does have 52 floors. That would mean the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm interpreting the 'floors' column correctly. The numbers in the 'floors' column are written as \"52\" without any additional formatting or units. So it's straightforward; 52 floors is correct.\n\nI also need to consider if there are any other relevant cells beyond just the 'floors' column that might affect this verification. For example, sometimes names can be tricky, but in this case, the name matches exactly, so I don't think there are any discrepancies there.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the height or years as tallest could influence the number of floors, but generally, the number of floors is a separate metric and not derived from height. So unless there's some hidden information here, the floors column should be taken at face value.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing the table, the Prudential Tower does have 52 floors, which supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}]}",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's saying that the Custom House Tower company has only 1 floor. So my main focus should be on the 'floors' column for the Custom House Tower entry.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building or company. The relevant columns here are \"name\" and \"floors.\" I'm particularly interested in the row where the name is \"custom house tower.\"\n\nIn the table, there's a row with \"custom house tower\" as the name. Under the 'floors' column, it shows 32 floors. So according to this, the Custom House Tower has 32 floors, not just one.\n\nI should also check if any other columns might relate, but since the claim is specifically about floors, I don't think other factors like height or years affect this particular claim. The 'height ft (m)' column provides information on the building's height, but that doesn't directly address the number of floors.\n\nTherefore, comparing the claim to the table data, it's clear that the Custom House Tower has 32 floors, which contradicts the claim stating it only has one floor.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the Custom House Tower actually has 32 floors as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the building on 800 boylston street has the most amount of floor.\" So first, I need to look at the table provided and see which building corresponds to that address.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row for \"prudential tower\" with the address 800 boylston street. So that's our building in question.\n\nNext, I need to check how many floors this building has. The column named \"floors\" shows that the prudential tower has 52 floors.\n\nNow, I should compare this number with all other buildings in the table to see if it indeed has the most floors. Let me list out each building's floors:\n\n- old state house: 3 floors\n- old north church: 1 floor\n- park street church: 1 floor\n- church of the covenant: 1 floor\n- custom house tower: 32 floors\n- prudential tower: 52 floors\n- hancock place: 60 floors\n\nComparing these, the highest number is hancock place with 60 floors. The prudential tower has 52 floors, which is less than 60. So, the claim that \"the building on 800 boylston street has the most amount of floor\" is false because another building (hancock place) has more floors.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant to verify this.

It's located at 800 Boylston Street. So, I need to find that row in the table. Scanning through the 'street address' column: \n\n- old state house: 206 Washington\n- old north church: 193 Salem\n- park street church: 1 Park\n- church of the covenant: 67 Newbury\n- custom house tower: 3 McKinley Square\n- prudential tower: 800 Boylston Street\n- hancock place: 200 Clarendon\n\nThere it is, row index 5 (since we start counting from 0). The name is \"prudential tower.\"\n\nNow, the claim is about the number of floors. Looking at the 'floors' column for this building, it shows 52. So the building has exactly 52 floors.\n\nThe claim says \"less than 52 floors.\" If the building actually has 52 floors, then it does not have less than 52. It's equal to 52, not less. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI also need to check which cells are relevant. The key columns here are 'street address' and 'floors.' For the prudential tower, row_index is 5, and the relevant columns are \"street address\" (to confirm it's the correct building) and \"floors\" (to check the number of floors).
