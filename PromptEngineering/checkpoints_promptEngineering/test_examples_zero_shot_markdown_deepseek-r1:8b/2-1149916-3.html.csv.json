    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"denny hulme be the driver at anderstorp in 1973.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see if there's a matching entry for Denny Hulme as the driver in 1973 and at the location Anderstorp.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the year, driver, constructor, location, and report. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- 1978: Driver is Niki Lauda, not Denny Hulme.\n- 1977: Jacques Laffite, nope.\n- 1976: Jody Scheckter, no.\n- 1975: Niki Lauda again, so that's not it either.\n- 1974: Jody Scheckter, same as before.\n- 1973: Here we go. The driver is Denny Hulme. Constructor is McLaren - Ford. Location is Anderstorp. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo yes, there is a row where Denny Hulme was the driver at Anderstorp in 1973. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. From the table, the relevant columns are 'year', 'driver', and 'location'. So for 1973, the row index is 6 because the first data row is 0, so 1973 would be row 6? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the table, it starts with header rows. The data rows start from 1978 as row 0. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 1978\nRow 1: 1977\n...\nSo each year decreases by 1 per row. So 1973 would be in which row? Let me count.\n\nFrom 1978 down to 1973 is a span of 5 years, so starting from 1978 as row 0, then:\n\nrow 0: 1978\nrow 1: 1977\nrow 2: 1976\nrow 3: 1975\nrow 4: 1974\nrow 5: 1973\n\nSo the relevant row is row 5. The columns are 'year', 'driver', and 'location'.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be for row 5, columns 'year' (1973), 'driver' (Denny Hulme), and 'location' (Anderstorp).\n\nWait, but in the example given, they only included two cells. Hmm, maybe I should follow that. But according to the instructions, each relevant cell is an object with row_index and column_name.\n\nSo for 1973, Denny Hulme at Anderstorp:\n\n- year: 1973\n- driver: Denny Hulme\n- location: Anderstorp\n\nThus, all three columns are relevant. But the example only had two. So maybe I should include all three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'report' column is also involved, but since it's just a report, and the claim doesn't refer to that, so probably not needed.\n\nSo in total, three cells: row 5, year; row 5, driver; and row 5, location.\n</think>\n\nThe table has an entry for Denny Hulme at Anderstorp in 1973. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
