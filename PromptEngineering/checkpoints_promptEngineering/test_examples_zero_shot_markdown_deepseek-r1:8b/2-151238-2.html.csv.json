Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in the year 1801 the population was 1602 and 1847 in 1811.\" So, I need to check if these numbers match what's in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it seems to have two main columns: 'year' and 'population'. The rows list various years from 1801 up to 2011. For each year, there are corresponding population figures.\n\nI should focus on the specific years mentioned in the claim: 1801 and 1811. Let's find their positions in the table.\n\nStarting with 1801. Scanning through the 'year' column, I see that the first row is for 1801. So, the population for 1801 is listed right after the year. In the 'population' column under 1801, it shows 1602. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking 1811. The table seems to have two sets of years: from 1801 up to 1901 on the left and then from 1911 to 2011 on the right. So, 1811 should be in the left side. Scanning again, yes, the third row is 1821, so 1811 must be just before that. Let me count: 1801, 1811, 1821... Yes, 1811 is the second row on the left. The population for 1811 is listed as 1847. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nNow, comparing both parts of the claim to the table data, both numbers match perfectly. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"population\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"population\"}]}",
