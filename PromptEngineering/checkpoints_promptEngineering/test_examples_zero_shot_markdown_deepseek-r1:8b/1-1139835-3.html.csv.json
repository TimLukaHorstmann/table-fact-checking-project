So not Collingwood.\n- 1978: Grand finalist is North Melbourne. Not Collingwood.\n- 1979: Grand finalist is Hawthorn. No.\n- 1980: Grand finalist is Collingwood. Yes, that's the year we're interested in. Now I'll check the scores for Collingwood in 1980.\n\nIn 1980, under \"scores\", it shows 8.9 (57) - 7.12 (54).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"season result be 7th when the sydney swan win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says that when Sydney Swans win, their season result is 7th. So I need to check if there's any row where the winner is Sydney Swans and the \"season result\" column has a value of 7th.\n\nFirst, I should identify all rows where the winners are Sydney Swans. Looking at the table:\n\n- In 1977, Hawthorn won.\n- 1978: Fitzroy\n- 1979: Collingwood\n- 1980: North Melbourne\n- 1981: Essendon\n- 1982: Sydney Swans\n- 1983: Carlton\n- 1984: Essendon\n- 1985: Hawthorn\n- 1986: Hawthorn\n\nSo, only row 1982 has Sydney Swans as the winners. Now, I need to check the \"season result\" for that year.\n\nIn 1982, the season result is listed as 7th. Therefore, when Sydney Swans won in 1982, their season result was indeed 7th.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there's a row where Sydney Swans are the winners and their season result is 7th.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the claim \"the result of season result 9th be fitzroy win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that in a particular season, when the result was 9th, it was Fitzy (Fitzroy) who won. So, my goal is to check if there's any row in the table where \"season result\" is \"9th\" and \"winners\" is \"fitzroy\".\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year from 1977 onwards. Each row has several columns: year, winners, grand finalist, scores, venue, crowd, margin, and season result.\n\nI'll start by looking for rows where the \"season result\" column matches \"9th\". Scanning through the table:\n\n- 1977: preliminary finalist\n- 1978: 9th\n- 1979: grand finalist\n- 1980: elimination finalist\n- 1981: elimination finalist\n- 1982: 7th\n- 1983: elimination finalist\n- 1984: premier\n- 1985: grand finalist\n- 1986: premier\n\nSo, the only row with \"season result\" as \"9th\" is the 1978 row. Now, I need to check who the winners were in that year. According to the table, in 1978, the winners are listed as \"fitzroy\". \n\nWait a minute, no. Let me double-check. The 1978 row has \"winners\" as \"fitzroy\"? Looking again: yes, it says fitzroy was the winner in 1978 when the season result was 9th.\n\nHold on, but sometimes I might confuse the term \"winners\". In sports contexts, especially in table data like this, does \"winners\" refer to the team that won the premiership or the grand final? But regardless of that, according to the table, in 1978, the season result was 9th and the winners were fitzroy.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim seems to be TRUE because in the year when the season result was 9th, it was Fitzroy who won. \n\nBut wait, I should make sure that \"season result\" is indeed referring to the same thing as the team's placement or position. In some contexts, the \"result\" could mean something else, like whether they made the finals or not. But here, looking at the column headers, it's labeled as \"season result\", and in 1978, it's explicitly stated as 9th. So, that would mean Fitzroy finished 9th that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because when the season result was 9th, it was indeed Fitzroy who won, at least according to the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in the year 1978, when the season result was 9th, Fitzroy was listed as the winner. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"season result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"winners\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the season result be premier with a margin of 51 for the year of 1984.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table to see what each column represents. Let me go through each column one by one.\n\nThe columns are: year, winners, grand finalist, scores, venue, crowd, margin, and season result.\n\nThe claim is about the \"season result\" being \"premier\" with a specific margin of 51 in the year 1984. So I need to find the row for 1984 and check two things: what's the season result and what's the margin.\n\nLooking at the table, there's an entry for 1984. Let me locate it. Scanning through each row:\n\n1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984... Yes, here it is: 1984.\n\nNow, let's check the \"season result\" for 1984. From the table, in 1984, the season result is listed as \"premier.\" That matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, the margin. The margin column shows numbers like 24, 76, etc. For 1984, the margin is 51. Wait, no, let me check again. Looking at the row for 1984: scores are 13.11 (89) -5.8(38). But the margin is listed right after crowd as 51.\n\nYes, the margin for 1984 is indeed 51. So both parts of the claim are satisfied: the season result is premier and the margin is 51 in 1984.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true, and the relevant cells are the ones for year (to confirm it's 1984), season result, and margin.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season result\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"margin\"}]}",

The claim is: \"essendon , the grand finalist , score 11.11 (77) 10.8 (68)\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the components of the claim. It seems like there are three parts: the team name (\"essendon\"), their position as a grand finalist, and their score in that particular game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1977 to 1986. The columns include year, winners, grand finalist, scores, venue, crowd, margin, and season result. \n\nI need to find cells that match each part of the claim. Starting with \"essendon\", I'll search through the \"winners\" column because if they're the winners, their name would be there. Let me scan down:\n\n- 1977: hawthorn\n- 1978: fitzroy\n- 1979: collingwood\n- 1980: north melbourne\n- 1981: essendon\n\nOkay, in 1981, the winners are \"essendon\". So that's a relevant cell at row_index 4 (since it's zero-indexed) and column_name \"winners\".\n\nNext part: \"the grand finalist\". This is a separate position from the winner. The table has a column called \"grand finalist\", so I'll check each row to see if \"essendon\" appears there. Looking through:\n\n- 1977: carlton\n- 1978: north melbourne\n- 1979: hawthorn\n- 1980: collingwood\n- 1981: north melbourne\n- 1982: sydney swans\n- 1983: richmond\n- 1984: sydney swans\n- 1985: essendon\n- 1986: carlton\n\nIn 1985, the grand finalist is \"essendon\". So that's row_index 8 and column_name \"grand finalist\".\n\nNow for the score part: \"11.11 (77) 10.8 (68)\". The scores are listed in the \"scores\" column as strings like \"14.11 (95) - 11.5 (71)\" etc. I need to find a row where both teams' scores match exactly.\n\nLooking at the rows, for each year:\n\n- 1981: essendon vs carlton; scores 9.11 (65) -6.5 (41). Doesn't match.\n- 1985: hawthorn vs essendon; scores 11.11 (77) -10.8 (68). Wait, that's exactly the score in the claim.\n\nSo for 1985, \"essendon\" is the grand finalist and their score against hawthorn is 11.11 (77) to 10.8 (68). That matches all three parts of the claim: team name, being a grand finalist, and the specific score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are where \"essendon\" won in 1981 as winners, and was a grand finalist in 1985.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"grand finalist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"Sydney Swan be the only winner between 1981 and 1984\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that Sydney Swans are the sole winners from 1981 to 1984. That means in each of those years\u20141981, 1982, 1983, and 1984\u2014the winner should be Sydney Swans, and no other team should win during this period.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided:\n\n- The columns are year, winners, grand finalist, scores, venue, crowd, margin, and season result.\n- The years in question are 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n\nI'll go through each year one by one.\n\nStarting with 1981:\n- Winners: Essendon\n- So Sydney Swans didn't win here. That's a problem because the claim says they should be the only winners in this period.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh no, 1981's winners are Essendon. That immediately contradicts the claim. But let me continue to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\n1982:\n- Winners: Sydney Swans\nThat's good for the claim, but since 1981 had a different winner, the overall claim is already false.\n\n1983:\n- Winners: Carlton\nAnother different winner. So far, only 1982 aligns with the claim.\n\n1984:\n- Winners: Essendon again? Wait, looking back at the table, in 1984, the winners are Essendon. So that's another team winning within our period.\n\nSo from 1981 to 1984, the winners were Essendon (1981), Sydney Swans (1982), Carlton (1983), and Essendon (1984). That means Sydney Swans didn't win every year in this span; they only won once. Therefore, the claim that they are the \"only\" winner is incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the years. The period is from 1981 to 1984 inclusive? Yes. So four years: '81, '82, '83, '84.\n\nWinners:\n- 1981: Essendon\n- 1982: Sydney Swans\n- 1983: Carlton\n- 1984: Essendon\n\nSo Sydney Swans only won in 1982. The claim says they are the \"only\" winner between those years, which isn't true because other teams also won.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells. The user wants me to identify which cells in the table support or negate the claim. Since the claim is about winners between 1981-1984, I should look at the \"winners\" column for those years.\n\nSo for each year from 1981 to 1984, the \"winners\" cell is relevant. Let's note their row indices:\n\nLooking at the table:\n- 1977: row 0\n- 1978: row 1\n- 1979: row 2\n- 1980: row 3\n- 1981: row 4\n- 1982: row 5\n- 1983: row 6\n- 1984: row 7\n\nSo for years 1981 (row 4), 1982 (row5), 1983(row6), and 1984(row7), the \"winners\" column is relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should be these four rows in the winners column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Sydney Swans are the only winner between 1981 and 1984 is FALSE because Essendon won in 1981 and 1984, Carlton won in 1983, and Sydney Swans only won once during this period. The relevant cells are those where the \"winners\" column corresponds to these years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"fitzroy be the winner with a season result higher than 9th\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. The key points are:\n1. Fitzroy must be the winner.\n2. Their season result must be higher than 9th.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where Fitzroy is a winner and check their season result.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\n- 1977: Winner is Hawthorn, not Fitzroy.\n- 1978: Winner is Fitzroy. Season result is listed as \"9th\". The claim says higher than 9th. So, 9th is equal to 9th, not higher. That might mean the claim is false because it's not higher but equal.\n- 1979 onwards: No other rows list Fitzroy as the winner.\n\nSo, only in 1978 is Fitzroy the winner. Their season result is \"9th\". The claim says higher than 9th, which would mean 10th or better, right? But 9th isn't higher than 9th. It's equal, not higher.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if \"higher than 9th\" means the rank number is less than 9, but that doesn't make sense because lower numbers are better (like 1st is better than 2nd). So if someone is ranked 9th, being higher would mean they performed worse. But in this context, a higher position numerically could be worse.\n\nWait, no, in the table, season result is listed as \"preliminary finalist\" or \"9th\", etc. The term \"higher than 9th\" likely means better than 9th, so like 8th or 7th, which are better positions.\n\nBut Fitzroy's season result is exactly 9th. So it's not higher than that; it's equal to it. Therefore, the claim that Fitzroy has a season result higher than 9th is false because it's exactly 9th.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Collingwood is the grand finalist.\n2. The winner is Essendon.\n\nSo I need to find a row in the table where both these conditions are met.

In 1978 it was Fitzroy vs North Melbourne, and so on. \n\nLooking for rows where Collingwood is the grand finalist.

So that's a red flag\u2014maybe the claim is false because Collingwood isn't listed as a grand finalist here. But let me double-check to be sure.\n\nNow, checking for when Essendon is the winner. From the table:\n- 1978: Winner is Fitzroy.\n- 1980: North Melbourne.\n- 1981: Carlton.\n- 1984: Essendon won against Sydney Swans.\n- 1985: Hawthorn won over Essendon.\n- 1986: Hawthorn again.\n\nSo in some years, Essendon was the winner. But looking at their respective grand finals:\n- In 1984, Essendon was the winner, and the grand finalist was Sydney Swans? Wait no, wait\u2014the table's columns are \"winners\" and \"grand finalist.\" So for 1984: winners were Essendon, and the grand finalist was Sydney Swans. So that doesn't match the claim because the grand finalist is not Collingwood.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim says where the winner is Essendon, and Collingwood is the grand finalist. Let me check each year Essendon won:\n\n1984: Winners are Essendon, grand finalist is Sydney Swans.\n1985: Winners are Hawthorn, so no.\nSo in 1984, Essendon was the winner but the grand finalist was someone else.\n\nIs there any year where the winner is Essendon and the grand finalist is Collingwood? From the table, I don't see such a combination. \n\nLooking again at each row, perhaps I missed something. Let's list them:\n\n1977: Hawthorn (winners), Carlton (grand finalist)\n1978: Fitzroy, North Melbourne\n1979: Collingwood (winners?), wait no: winners are Collingwood vs Hawthorn? Wait no, looking back.\n\nWait the table has \"winners\" as:\n- 1977: hawthorn\n- 1978: fitzroy\n- 1979: collingwood\n- 1980: north melbourne\n- 1981: essendon\n- 1982: sydney swans\n- 1983: carlton\n- 1984: essendon\n- 1985: hawthorn\n- 1986: hawthorn\n\nSo in 1979, the winners were Collingwood. The grand finalist was Hawthorn.\n\nWait, so in 1979, Collingwood won, but the grand finalist was Hawthorn. So that's not matching because the claim is that the winner is Essendon and Collingwood is the grand finalist.\n\nIn 1984, Essendon was the winner, and the grand finalist was Sydney Swans. \n\nIs there any row where the winner is Essendon and the grand finalist is Collingwood? From the table provided, I don't see such a match.\n\nSo that suggests that the claim is false because there's no instance in the table where both conditions are met: Collingwood being the grand finalist and Essendon being the winner. \n\nAdditionally, looking at all the rows, Collingwood appears as winners in 1979, but not as a grand finalist. Essendon was a winner in 1984 and 1981, but their respective opponents were Sydney Swans and Carlton, neither of which is Collingwood.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood was a grand finalist when Essendon won.

So it doesn't apply.\n2. **1978**: Margin is 76. That's higher than 30. The season result is \"9th\". Not a premier.\n3. **1979**: Margin is 28. Less than 30. Doesn't apply.\n4. **1980**: Margin is 3. No, doesn't apply.\n5. **1981**: Margin is 24. Again, less than 30.\n6. **1982**: Margin is 32. That's above 30. Season result here is \"7th\". Not a premier.\n7. **1983**: Margin is 34. Higher than 30. The season result is \"elimination finalist\". So not a premier.\n8. **1984**: Margin is 51. Above 30. Season result is \"premier\". This fits the claim.\n9. **1985**: Margin is 9. Doesn't apply.\n10. **1986**: Margin is 30. Wait, the claim says higher than 30, so 30 isn't included. So doesn't apply.\n\nFrom this analysis, I see that only in 1984 does a margin greater than 30 result in a \"premier\". But wait, let me check if there are any other instances where margin >30 and season result is premier.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- 1978: Margin 76, not a premier.\n- 1982: 32 margin, not a premier.\n- 1983: 34 margin, not a premier.\n- Only 1984: 51 margin, which is a premier.\n\nSo, only one instance where the claim holds. But wait, the claim says \"always\", meaning it must hold true for all cases where margin >30. Since there are multiple instances (1978, 1982, 1983, and 1984) with margin over 30, but only 1984 results in a premier, that means the claim is not always true. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe claim says when the margin is higher than 30, then the season result is premier. So every row where margin >30 must have season result as 'premier'.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- 1978: Margin 76 >30, but result is 9th.\n- 1982: Margin 32>30, result is 7th.\n- 1983: Margin 34>30, result is elimination finalist.\n- 1984: Margin51>30, result is premier.\n\nSo, only in 1984 does it hold. The others do not. Therefore, the claim that whenever margin >30, season result is premier is FALSE because in 1978, 1982, and 1983, margin was higher than 30 but the season result wasn't a premier.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "essendon have have a margin greater than 10 when they be a grand finalist",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Essendon have a margin greater than 10 when they are a grand finalist\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Essendon's margins are greater than 10 points specifically when they reach the grand final. So I need to look at the rows where Essendon is a grand finalist and check their margin in those instances.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are multiple years listed from 1977 onwards. Each row represents a different year with various details like winners, grand finalists, scores, venue, crowd, margin, and season result.\n\nI need to identify which rows involve Essendon being a grand finalist. To do this, I'll go through each row:\n\n- **1977**: Winners are Hawthorn, Grand Finalists are Carlton. So not Essendon.\n- **1978**: Winners are Fitzroy, Grand Finalists are North Melbourne. Not Essendon.\n- **1979**: Winners are Collingwood, Grand Finalists are Hawthorn. Not Essendon.\n- **1980**: Winners are North Melbourne, Grand Finalists are Collingwood. Not Essendon.\n- **1981**: Winners are Essendon, but Grand Finalists are Carlton. So Essendon is the winner here, not the grand finalist.\n- **1982**: Winners are Sydney Swans, Grand Finalists are North Melbourne. Not Essendon.\n- **1983**: Winners are Carlton, Grand Finalists are Richmond. Not Essendon.\n- **1984**: Winners are Essendon, and Grand Finalists are Sydney Swans. So Essendon is the winner, not the grand finalist.\n- **1985**: Winners are Hawthorn, Grand Finalists are Essendon. Here's one where Essendon is a grand finalist.\n- **1986**: Winners are Hawthorn, Grand Finalists are Carlton. Not Essendon.\n\nFrom this, only in 1985 does Essendon appear as a grand finalist. Now I need to check the margin for that year.\n\nLooking at the \"margin\" column for 1985: It's listed as 9. So the margin is 9, which is less than 10.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"greater than 10.\" Since 9 is not greater than 10, this would make the statement false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed other instances where Essendon was a grand finalist. Let me double-check each row:\n\nIn 1985, Essendon is the winner, and their opponents in the grand final are Carlton? Or wait, no: In 1985, winners are Hawthorn, so the grand finalists must be Essendon against someone else. Wait, looking at the table again, the \"grand finalist\" column for 1985 says \"essendon.\" So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo in 1985, when Essendon is a grand finalist, their margin is 9, which is less than 10. Therefore, the claim is false because there isn't a case where Essendon's margin as a grand finalist is greater than 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there are any other years where Essendon was a grand finalist beyond 1985, but in the table provided, the data stops at 1986. So within the given data, the only time Essendon is a grand finalist is in 1985 with a margin of 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no instance where Essendon has a margin greater than 10 when they are a grand finalist.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Essendon have a margin greater than 10 when they are a grand finalist. By examining the table, we find that Essendon was a grand finalist in 1985 with a margin of 9, which is not greater than 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"margin\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "from 1977 to 1986 , collingwood have be the grand finalist or winner at the 2 biggest margin",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"From 1977 to 1986, Collingwood have been the grand finalist or winner at the 2 biggest margin.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that during each year from 1977 to 1986, Collingwood either won (i.e., was the winner) or was the grand finalist with a margin of two points in those games.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each year from 1977 to 1986 and see if Collingwood is listed as the winner or grand finalist with margins that are among the top two for that season.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **1977**: Winners are Hawthorn. Grand finalist is Carlton. Collingwood isn't mentioned here, so irrelevant.\n2. **1978**: Winners are Fitzroy. Grand finalist is North Melbourne. Collingwood isn't here either.\n3. **1979**: Winners are Collingwood. Grand finalist is Hawthorn. So in 1979, Collingwood was the winner. I need to note their margin for that year. The score is 12.8 (80) - 7.10 (52). The margin is 28 points.\n4. **1980**: Winners are North Melbourne. Grand finalist is Collingwood. The margin is 3 points. Not top two, so maybe not relevant unless the claim says \"or winner\" which is separate.\n5. **1981**: Winners are Essendon. Grand finalist is Carlton. Collingwood isn't a winner here and isn't the grand finalist either.\n6. **1982**: Winners are Sydney Swans. Grand finalist is North Melbourne. No mention of Collingwood, so irrelevant.\n7. **1983**: Winners are Carlton. Grand finalist is Richmond. Collingwood not involved here.\n8. **1984**: Winners are Essendon. Grand finalist is Sydney Swans. Collingwood isn't a winner or grand finalist this year.\n9. **1985**: Winners are Hawthorn. Grand finalist is Essendon. Again, no mention of Collingwood as either winner or grand finalist.\n10. **1986**: Winners are Hawthorn again. Grand finalist is Carlton. No Collingwood here.\n\nNow, I need to check the margins where Collingwood was involved. From 1979, Collingwood was the winner with a margin of 28 points. Looking at other years:\n\n- In 1977, Hawthorn beat Carlton by 24 points.\n- 1978: Fitzroy over North Melbourne 76 points.\n- 1980: North Melbourne over Collingwood by 3 points.\n- 1981: Essendon beat Carlton by 24 points.\n- 1982: Sydney Swans over North Melbourne by 32 points.\n- 1983: Carlton over Richmond by 34 points.\n- 1984: Essendon beat Sydney Swans by 51 points.\n- 1985: Hawthorn over Essendon by 9 points.\n- 1986: Hawthorn over Carlton by 30 points.\n\nSo, in the years from 1977 to 1986, Collingwood was only a winner in 1979 with a margin of 28. The highest margins were in 1984 (51) and 1982 (32). Since Collingwood's margin is lower than these, but the claim says \"at the 2 biggest margin,\" it seems they need to have been either winners or grand finalists with two top margins.\n\nBut looking at each year, Collingwood was only a winner in 1979. They were also a grand finalist in 1980, but that margin was only 3 points. The claim says \"grand finalist or winner at the 2 biggest margin,\" which might mean having been involved (either as winner or grand finalist) in two of the top margins.\n\nHowever, in the years from 1977-1986, Collingwood's margins are not among the highest two. For instance:\n\n- 1984: Essendon over Sydney Swans by 51 points.\n- 1982: Sydney Swans over North Melbourne by 32 points.\n\nThese are the top two margins. Collingwood's margins in their wins (28) and as a grand finalist (3) don't reach these top two. So, they didn't have margins that were part of the two biggest.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because Collingwood was only involved in margins lower than 51 and 32 points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on the idea that Collingwood either won or was a grand finalist with the top two margins from 1977 to 1986. Upon reviewing each year, Collingwood only achieved a margin of 28 when winning in 1979 and had a lower margin as a grand finalist in 1980 (3 points). The two largest margins during this period were 51 and 32 points respectively, not involving Collingwood.\n\n**Answer:** \"FALSE\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"grand finalist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
