    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"2/3 of the judge appointments have more than 10 years until their mandatory retirement.\" So, I'm supposed to check if two-thirds of the judges listed in the table have more than 10 years remaining before they must retire.\n\nFirst, I should count how many judges there are in total. Looking at the table, I see that there are 9 judges listed:\n\n1. anabelle rodr\u00edguez\n2. edgardo rivera garcia\n3. erick kolthoff caraballo\n4. federico hern\u00e1ndez denton\n5. liana fiol matta\n6. luis estrella mart\u00ednez\n7. mildred pab\u00f3n charneco\n8. rafael mart\u00ednez torres\n9. roberto feliberti cintr\u00f3n\n\nSo, 9 judges in total.\n\nNow, the claim is about 2/3 of these appointments. Let me calculate 2/3 of 9. 2/3 of 9 is 6, so we need to check if at least 6 judges have more than 10 years until retirement.\n\nNext, I'll go through each judge and note their \"years until mandatory retirement\" from the table.\n\n1. anabelle rodr\u00edguez: 6 years\n2. edgardo rivera garcia: 11 years\n3. erick kolthoff caraballo: 17 years\n4. federico hern\u00e1ndez denton: 0 year (so he's already retired or will retire immediately)\n5. liana fiol matta: 2 years\n6. luis estrella mart\u00ednez: 27 years\n7. mildred pab\u00f3n charneco: 13 years\n8. rafael mart\u00ednez torres: 15 years\n9. roberto feliberti cintr\u00f3n: 19 years\n\nNow, I'll identify which judges have more than 10 years until retirement.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n1. anabelle rodr\u00edguez: 6 < 10 \u2192 No\n2. edgardo rivera garcia: 11 > 10 \u2192 Yes\n3. erick kolthoff caraballo: 17 > 10 \u2192 Yes\n4. federico hern\u00e1ndez denton: 0 \u2192 Not applicable (already retired)\n5. liana fiol matta: 2 < 10 \u2192 No\n6. luis estrella mart\u00ednez: 27 > 10 \u2192 Yes\n7. mildred pab\u00f3n charneco: 13 > 10 \u2192 Yes\n8. rafael mart\u00ednez torres: 15 > 10 \u2192 Yes\n9. roberto feliberti cintr\u00f3n: 19 > 10 \u2192 Yes\n\nSo, counting the \"Yes\" responses:\n\n- edgardo rivera garcia\n- erick kolthoff caraballo\n- luis estrella mart\u00ednez\n- mildred pab\u00f3n charneco\n- rafael mart\u00ednez torres\n- roberto feliberti cintr\u00f3n\n\nThat's 6 judges. Since 2/3 of 9 is indeed 6, this meets the criteria.\n\nWait, but I should check if it's exactly 2/3 or at least 2/3. The claim says \"more than 10 years,\" so any judge with more than 10 counts towards the 2/3. Since there are exactly 6 out of 9, that's 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly 2/3 (6) of the judges have more than 10 years until retirement.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two-thirds of the judge appointments have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement. The table shows 9 judges, and calculating two-thirds gives 6. Checking each judge's remaining years:\n\n- 6 judges have more than 10 years left.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this decision. The claim is: \"just 1 of the judge be appoint as a chief justice.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various judges along with their ranks, years until mandatory retirement, who they were appointed by, and the year of their appointment.\n\nI'm focusing on the title \"chief justice\" here because the claim is about someone being appointed as such. So, I need to check if there's only one person in the table who holds the rank of chief justice. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez - associate justice\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda - associate justice\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo - associate justice\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton - chief justice\n5. Liana Fiol Matta - associate justice\n6. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez - associate justice\n7. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco - associate justice\n8. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres - associate justice\n9. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n - associate justice\n\nFrom this, only Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is a chief justice. There are no other entries with the rank of chief justice. That means there's exactly one judge appointed as chief justice.\n\nNow, to verify this claim, I need to check the relevant cells. Specifically, I should look at the 'rank' column and see which rows have \"chief justice.\" Only row 4 has that rank. Therefore, the relevant cell is row index 4 and the column name \"rank.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, since there's exactly one chief justice in the table, the claim is TRUE, and the only relevant cell is where Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton's rank is listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about justices and their appointments. The claim is saying that only three of the new justices were appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. My task is to check if this is true or false.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row in the table and see who was appointed by whom. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: her \"appointed by\" field says Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n, so that's one.\n\nNext, Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: same here, appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. That's two now.\n\nErick Kolthoff Caraballo is also appointed by Sila, making it three.\n\nWait, but then Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed by Sila as well. So that would make four justices appointed by her, not just three. The claim says only three, so this might mean the claim is false.\n\nBut I should check all rows to be sure. Liana Fiol Matta: again, Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appoints her, so that's five now. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, same with Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco and Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres\u2014all under Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Lastly, Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n is also under Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nSo in total, Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appoints five justices (Anabelle, Edgardo, Erick, Federico, Liana), while Luis Fortu\u00f1o appointed four (Edgardo? Wait no, Edgardo was under Sila. Let me recount: Anabelle (Sila), Edgardo (Sila), Erick (Sila), Federico (Sila), Liana (Sila). That's five. Then Luis Estrella (Luis Fortu\u00f1o), Mildred (Luis Fortu\u00f1o), Rafael (Luis Fortu\u00f1o), Roberto (Luis Fortu\u00f1o). So four under Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nThe claim is that only three were appointed by Sila. But she actually has five. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, to find which cells are relevant. The \"appointed by\" column is where we check who made the appointments. For each justice, if their \"appointed by\" is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n, that cell is relevant because it shows she appointed them. So I need to list those rows where \"appointed by\" is Sila.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Anabelle - Sila\nRow 1: Edgardo - Sila\nRow 2: Erick - Sila\nRow 3: Federico - Sila\nRow 4: Liana - Sila\n\nSo rows 0,1,2,3,4 are relevant because they show Sila appointed them. The claim says only three, but there are five, so the answer is false.\n\nWait, the claim says \"only 3 of the new justice be appoint by sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n\". Maybe I miscounted? Let me count again:\n\nAnabelle (2004)\nEdgardo (2010)\nErick (2009)\nFederico (2004)\nLiana (2004)\n\nThat's five, yes. So only three is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are those where \"appointed by\" is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n, which are rows 0 to 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify how many justices were appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. By examining each row, it's clear that five justices (Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez, Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda, Erick Kolthoff Caraballo, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, and Liana Fiol Matta) were appointed by her. Since the claim states only three, it is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The claim concerns who appointed the justices.\n2. **Analyze Each Row:** Check each justice's \"appointed by\" field.\n3. **Count Appointments by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n:** Found five such appointees.\n4. **Compare with Claim:** Since there are five, not three, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Rows where \"appointed by\" is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n (rows 0 to 4).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n only appoint new justice during the year 2004\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n only appointed new justices during the year 2004. So I need to check if all the appointments she made were in 2004.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a justice, including who appointed them and the year they were appointed. The relevant column here is \"year appointed.\" \n\nSo, I should look for any justices where Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n was the appointer but their year appointed isn't 2004. If such cases exist, that would make the claim false.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: Appointed by Sila in 2004.\n2. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: Also appointed by Sila in 2004.\n3. Liana Fiol Matta: Same here, 2004.\n4. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: His appointment was in 2011, not 2004.\n5. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: Appointed in 2009, so not 2004.\n6. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: 2009 again.\n7. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: 2011.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only\" during 2004. So any justice appointed by Sila after 2004 would disprove the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez was appointed in 2011 by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, not Sila. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco and Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres were appointed in 2009, which is different from 2004. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n was in 2011 as well.\n\nSo Sila's appointments include some years other than 2004 (specifically, 2004, 2009, 2011). Therefore, the claim that she only appointed new justices during 2004 is false because there are other appointment years beyond 2004 where she did appoint justices.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n only appointed justices in 2004, we examine all her appointments.

The claim says: \"only 1 of the justice be appoint in 2010.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that only one justice was appointed in the year 2010. So, my task is to look through the table and check how many justices were appointed in 2010.\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see four relevant columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. The claim specifically mentions \"appointed in 2010,\" so I should focus on the \"year appointed\" column to find out which justices were appointed that year.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table and note down the \"name\" and \"year appointed.\" \n\n- Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez was appointed in 2004.\n- Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda was appointed in 2010. That's one.\n- Erick Kolthoff Caraballo was appointed in 2009.\n- Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed in 2004.\n- Liana Fiol Matta was appointed in 2004.\n- Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez was appointed in 2011.\n- Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco was appointed in 2009.\n- Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres was appointed in 2009.\n- Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n was appointed in 2011.\n\nFrom this, I can see that only Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda was appointed in 2010. So that's one justice. The claim says \"only 1 of the justice be appoint in 2010,\" which matches my findings.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Scanning through each row again, no other justice has a year appointed of 2010 except Edgardo. So yes, only one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's exactly one justice appointed in 2010.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"only 1 of the justice be appoint in 2010,\" I checked each row for appointments in 2010.

It claims that none of the judges listed had a tenure longer than one year when they were chief justice.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. The key here is to find the column related to the time spent as chief justice. In the table, the \"rank\" column indicates whether someone is an associate justice or a chief justice.\n\nSo, for each row where the rank is \"chief justice,\" I need to check the number of years they served in that role. The claim says none of them stayed more than a year. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez - Associate Justice\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda - Associate Justice\n3.

The claim says, \"some of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"some of the judges be appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o\" implies that there exists at least one judge in the table who was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the columns are: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed.

The relevant column is \"appointed by,\" so I'll list all the rows where this column has the value \"Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\"\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n \u2192 Not relevant\n- Row 2: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 Relevant (row_index=1)\n- Row 3: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 Relevant (row_index=2)\n- Row 4: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n \u2192 Not relevant\n- Row 5: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n \u2192 Not relevant\n- Row 6: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 Relevant (row_index=6)\n- Row 7: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 Relevant (row_index=7)\n- Row 8: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 Relevant (row_index=8)\n- Row 9: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 Relevant (row_index=9)\n\nSo, the relevant cells are rows 1,2,6,7,8, and 9. Wait, no\u2014rows are numbered from 0 to 8, right? So row indices start at 0.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\n- Row 1: index=0 \u2192 Appointed by Sila\n- Row 2: index=1 \u2192 Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 relevant\n- Row 3: index=2 \u2192 Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 relevant\n- Row 4: index=3 \u2192 Sila\n- Row 5: index=4 \u2192 Sila\n- Row 6: index=5 \u2192 Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 relevant\n- Row 7: index=6 \u2192 Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 relevant\n- Row 8: index=7 \u2192 Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 relevant\n- Row 9: index=8 \u2192 Fortu\u00f1o \u2192 relevant\n\nSo, the relevant rows are indices 1,2,5,6,7,8. That's six rows where the judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON response, I need to list each of these cells with their row_index and column_name.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. My main focus will be on the \"appointed by\" column because the claim is about judges being appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nI should go through each row to check if any judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. If there's at least one such case, the claim could be TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2010.\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n5. Liana Fiol Matta was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n6. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2011.\n7. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n8. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n9. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2011.\n\nFrom this, I can see that several judges (Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda, Erick Kolthoff Caraballo, Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco, Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres, and Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n) were indeed appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. \n\nThe claim says \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o.\" I think it means that at least one judge meets this criterion. Since there are multiple, the claim is definitely TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each row where \"appointed by\" is Luis Fortu\u00f1o is important. So, the rows for Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda (row 1), Erick Kolthoff Caraballo (row 2), Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco (row 6), Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres (row 7), and Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n (row 8) are relevant.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to provide a list of objects with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\" (string). Looking at the markdown table, the columns are: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, year appointed. The relevant column is \"appointed by.\"\n\nSo for each relevant row, I'll get the row index and note that the \"appointed by\" column is relevant.\n\nI should list these as separate objects in an array within \"relevant_cells.\" Let me make sure of the row indices:\n\n- Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: Row 1\n- Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: Row 2\n- Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: Row 6\n- Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: Row 7\n- Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: Row 8\n\nWait, the rows are indexed starting from 0 in the markdown table. So:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez is row 0.\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda is row 1.\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo is row 2.\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is row 3.\n5. Liana Fiol Matta is row 4.\n6. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez is row 5.\n7. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco is row 6.\n8. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres is row 7.\n9. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n is row 8.\n\nSo the relevant rows are 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nTherefore, the \"relevant_cells\" will include these row indices and the column name \"appointed by.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by multiple entries in the table where judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. The rows list various individuals along with their ranks, the number of years until they must retire, who appointed them, and the year of appointment.\n\nThe claim is about Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointing someone as the chief justice. So, I need to find in the table if there's a chief justice whose \"appointed by\" field is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (index 0) is Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez, an associate justice appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n- The fourth row (index 3) is Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, who is a chief justice. His \"appointed by\" field is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n, and he was appointed in 2004.\n\nSo, this means that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n did indeed appoint someone as the chief justice, specifically Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
