    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the performance of 'higher and higher' in the top 20 bracket garderned an advancement.\" Wait, \"garderned\" seems like a typo. Maybe it should be \"garnered\"? So the intended meaning is likely that performing \"Higher and Higher\" in the Top 20 led to an advancement.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row where the song \"higher and higher\" appears. Scanning through the 'song choice' column:\n\n- audition: walking on the moon\n- vegas verdicts: living for the city\n- top 20: higher and higher\n- top 10: bring it on home to me\n- top 8: easy\n- top 4: can't help falling in love sir duke\n- finale: red red wine\n\nSo \"higher and higher\" is only in the 'top 20' row. Now, looking at the 'result' column for that same row, it's marked as \"advanced.\"\n\nTherefore, the performance of \"higher and higher\" in the Top 20 resulted in an advancement. That supports the claim.\n\nNow, to identify relevant cells: we need the row where the song is performed (row index) and the columns involved, which are 'song choice' and 'result.'\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n- Row index 2 (since weeks start at 0? Wait, let me count:\n\nWait, the table's week column has values like audition, vegas verdicts, etc. Let me list them with their indices.\n\nRow 0: audition\nRow 1: vegas verdicts\nRow 2: top 20\nRow 3: top 10\nRow 4: top 8\nRow 5: top 4\nRow 6: finale\n\nSo \"top 20\" is row index 2. The columns are 'song choice' and 'result.' So the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row 2, column 'song choice': \"higher and higher\"\n- For row 2, column 'result': \"advanced\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because there's a matching result in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction to check if \"audition be the week the original artist, lionel richie.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it mentions two things: the week is \"audition,\" and the original artist is Lionel Richie. So I need to find a row in the table where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, and result. I'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Audition Week**: The first row is labeled \"audition.\" Let's check what the original artist is here. It says \"the police.\" Hmm, that's not Lionel Richie. So this row doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n   \n2. **Vegas verdicts Week**: Next, the week is \"vegas verdicts,\" but there's an \"n/a\" in the theme and original artist columns. That might be confusing, but regardless, the original artist isn't Lionel Richie here either.\n\n3. **Top 20 Week**: The top 20 row has a theme of group 2. Song choice is \"higher and higher,\" original artist is Jackie Wilson. Again, not Lionel Richie.\n\n4. **Top 10 Week**: Theme is n/a, but the song choice is \"bring it on home to me\" by Sam Cooke. Not our guy.\n\n5. **Top 8 Week**: This row mentions heroes as the theme. Song choice is \"easy\" by Lionel Richie. Wait, so here, the original artist is listed as Lionel Richie. But let's check if the week is \"audition.\" No, this is top 8, not audition.\n\n6. **Top 4 Week**: Theme is judges' choice. The song is \"can't help falling in love sir duke\" by Elvis Presley and Stevie Wonder. Not applicable here.\n\n7. **Finale Week**: Theme is duets, song is \"red red wine\" by Neil Diamond. Not relevant.\n\nSo, I'm looking for a row where the week is \"audition\" and the original artist is Lionel Richie. The only row with \"audition\" as the week has the police as the original artist, not Lionel. Therefore, there's no matching row in the table that satisfies both conditions of the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each row again quickly.\n\n- Audition: The Police \u2013 no.\n- Vegas verdicts: n/a \u2013 doesn't matter.\n- Top 20: Jackie Wilson \u2013 no.\n- Top 10: Sam Cooke \u2013 no.\n- Top 8: Lionel Richie \u2013 yes, but the week isn't audition.\n- Other rows don't apply.\n\nSo, none of the rows meet both parts of the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the \"audition\" week, the original artist was Lionel Richie. Checking the table, the \"audition\" row has The Police as the original artist. Since this doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"higher and higher song garner an advanced result during top 10 week\" is true or false by checking the provided table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a song called \"higher and higher.\" Looking at the table, I should check which rows have this song listed in the 'song choice' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Audition week: Song is \"Walking on the Moon\" \u2013 not it.\n2. Vegas Verdicts: Song is \"Living for the City\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Top 20: \"Higher and Higher\" \u2013 yes, this is relevant because the song choice matches.\n4. Top 10: \"Bring It On Home to Me\" \u2013 that's different, so not relevant here.\n5. Top 8: \"Easy\" \u2013 no match.\n6. Top 4: \"Can't Help Falling in Love Sir Duke\" \u2013 nope.\n7. Finale: \"Red Red Wine\" \u2013 doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the claim says \"during top 10 week,\" which would correspond to the 'top 10' row. But in that row, the song choice is \"Bring It On Home to Me,\" not \"Higher and Higher.\" So that's a different song. The \"Higher and Higher\" is actually in the 'Top 20' week.\n\nSo even though \"Higher and Higher\" is an advanced result, it doesn't happen during the top 10 week. Therefore, the claim might be false because the correct week isn't the one mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which rows are under 'top 10.' Looking back at the table:\n\n- The row labeled \"Top 20\" has the song \"Higher and Higher,\" with an advanced result.\n- The row \"Top 10\" is a different song. So in the top 10 week, it's not that song.\n\nHence, the claim says during top 10 week, but the higher and higher song was in top 20. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"higher and higher\" song resulted in an advanced outcome during the top 10 week. However, upon reviewing the table, \"Higher and Higher\" appears under the 'Top 20' week, not the 'Top 10.' Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
