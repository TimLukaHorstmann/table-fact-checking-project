Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Pittsburgh. Points are 18. Attendance is 5307.\n  \nThat seems to match all the criteria mentioned in the claim. The home team (Pittsburgh) scored 18 points against Minnesota with 5307 attendees.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by this row's data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"On December 26, the score was St. Louis 3, Pittsburgh 2, with 20 points accumulated.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the date in the claim, which is December 26. I need to find the corresponding row in the table. Scanning through the 'date' column, I see that there's an entry for December 26. That should be the relevant row.\n\nNext, I'll check the other parts of the claim. The score is St. Louis 3 vs. Pittsburgh 2. In the table, the columns related to this would be 'visitor' and 'score'. For December 26, the visitor is St. Louis with a score of 2 - 3 (since it's written as \"St. louis\" in the table). Wait, no, the claim says St. Louis scored 3 points. Looking at the table, under date December 26, visitor is St. Louis and the score is listed as 2-3. So the home team, Pittsburgh, would have 3 - 2 from their perspective? Or is it that the visitor's score is first?\n\nWait, the 'score' column might be written in a specific format. For example, on December 26, the visitor (St. Louis) scored 2 points and lost to Pittsburgh who scored 3. But in the table, under the 'score' column for that date, it says \"2 - 3\". So maybe the first number is the home team's score, and the second is the visitor's? Or vice versa.\n\nWait, looking back at other rows: For December 1, Pittsburgh is the visitor with a score of 4-4 against Oakland. On that same row, the 'score' column is \"4 - 4\". So perhaps the first number is the visitor's points and the second is the home's? Or maybe it's split into two parts: the first part is the visitor's points, the hyphen, then the home's points.\n\nWait no, because in the claim, the score is given as St. Louis 3, Pittsburgh 2. So if I'm looking for that exact score on December 26, what does the table show? The 'score' column for December 26 is \"2 - 3\". So perhaps that's 2 points for Pittsburgh (home) and 3 for St. Louis (visitor). But in the claim, it says St. Louis scored 3, Pittsburgh scored 2. That matches because the visitor would be St. Louis with 3 points.\n\nWait, but the 'score' column on December 26 is \"2 - 3\". So if that's the home team first, then the home (Pittsburgh) scored 2 and the visitor (St. Louis) scored 3. That fits with the claim: St. Louis scored 3, Pittsburgh scored 2.\n\nNow, checking the 'points' column for December 26. The table shows 20 points accumulated. So that matches as well.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Date: December 26 (matches)\n- Score: Visitor (St. Louis) 3, Home (Pittsburgh) 2 (matches)\n- Points: 20 (matches)\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are date, score, and points for that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the point be 18 when the home team be boston\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that whenever the home team is Boston, the points scored should be 18. So I need to check all rows where the \"home\" column is Boston and see if their corresponding \"points\" are 18.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I can go through each row one by one. The columns in question here are \"date\", \"visitor\", \"score\", \"home\", \"attendance\", \"record\", and \"points\". But the relevant ones for this claim are \"home\" and \"points\".\n\nI'll start scanning each row:\n\n1. December 1: Home team is Oakland, points are 15. Not relevant.\n2. December 4: Home team is Pittsburgh, points are 15. Not Boston, so skip.\n3. December 7: Home team is St Louis, points are 16. Not relevant.\n4. December 8: Home team is Pittsburgh again. Same as above.\n5. December 11: Home team is Minnesota, points are 18. Not Boston, so no.\n6. December 14: Home team is Pittsburgh, points are 18. Not relevant.\n7. December 15: Home team is Boston. Ah, this is the first row where home is Boston. Let me check the \"points\" column here\u2014it shows 18. So that's one row matching.\n\n8. December 17: Home team is Philadelphia, points are 18. Not relevant.\n9. December 21: Home team is Pittsburgh, points are 18. Skip.\n10. December 22: Home team is Chicago, points are 18. No.\n11. December 25: Home team is Detroit, points are 20. Not relevant.\n12. December 26: Home team is St Louis, points are 20. No.\n13. December 28: Home team is Oakland, points are 20. Skip.\n14. December 31: Home team is Montreal, points are 20. Not relevant.\n\nFrom this, I see that there's only one row where the home team is Boston, and in that case, the points were indeed 18. So the claim seems to hold true for that instance. But wait, does the claim specify whether it's every time or just when? The way it's phrased is \"the point be 18 when the home team be boston,\" which sounds like whenever Boston is home, the points are 18. From the table, I can only confirm one such occurrence where both conditions are met.\n\nBut maybe the claim expects that every game where Boston is the home team results in 18 points. Since there's only one instance and it's correct, but if there were more instances, we'd have to check all of them. But here, since only one exists, it meets the condition.\n\nSo I think the claim is TRUE based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that whenever the home team is Boston, the points scored are 18. By checking each row in the table, only December 15th meets both conditions, with points being 18 when the home team is Boston.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"2 - 3 be score , when visitor be pittsburgh , and when point be less than 20.\"\n\nBreaking it down, there are three parts:\n\n1. The score should be \"2 - 3\".\n2. The visitor should be \"pittsburgh\".\n3. The points should be less than 20.\n\nI need to check each of these conditions in the table and see if any cells match all three criteria.\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the visitor is pittsburgh. Scanning through the 'visitor' column:\n\n- Row 0: pittsburgh\n- Row 1: detroit\n- Row 2: pittsburgh\n- Row 3: toronto\n- Row 4: pittsburgh\n- Row 5: los angeles\n- Row 6: pittsburgh\n- Row 7: pittsburgh\n- Row 8: minnesota\n- Row 9: pittsburgh\n- Row 10: pittsburgh\n- Row 11: detroit\n- Row 12: pittsburgh\n- Row 13: oakland\n- Row 14: montreal\n\nSo, the rows where visitor is pittsburgh are indices 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14.\n\nNext, I need to check for each of these rows if their score is \"2 - 3\". Looking at the 'score' column:\n\n- Row 0: 4 - 4\n- Row 1: 7 - 2\n- Row 2: 1 - 1\n- Row 3: 4 - 1\n- Row 4: 4 - 2\n- Row 5: 2 - 1\n- Row 6: 3 - 5\n- Row 7: 2 - 8\n- Row 8: 3 - 1\n- Row 9: 1 - 3\n- Row 10: 3 - 6\n- Row 11: 4 - 3\n- Row 12: 2 - 3\n- Row 13: 4 - 3\n- Row 14: 4 - 3\n\nI see that at row index 12, the score is \"2 - 3\" and the visitor is pittsburgh. Now I need to check if the points for this row are less than 20.\n\nLooking at the 'points' column:\n\n- Row 0: 15\n- Row 1: 15\n- ...\n- Row 12: points are 20\n- ...\n\nWait, row 12 has points as 20. The claim requires points to be less than 20, so 20 is not less than 20.\n\nBut hold on, the claim says \"point be less than 20\". So does that include exactly 20? No, it's strictly less than. Therefore, row 12 doesn't satisfy all three conditions because points are 20.\n\nAre there any other rows where visitor is pittsburgh, score is \"2 - 3\", and points are less than 20?\n\nLooking again at the table:\n\nRow 12: pittsburgh, score 2-3, points 20 \u2192 not qualifying.\nOther rows with pittsburgh as visitor don't have a score of \"2 - 3\". The only one is row 12.\n\nTherefore, there's no row that satisfies all three conditions. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires finding a game where the visitor is Pittsburgh, the score is 2-3, and points are less than 20. In the table, only row index 12 matches the visitor and score criteria but has 20 points, which doesn't meet the third condition. No rows satisfy all three conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions.\n\nThe claim says: \"when home be boston , the lowest point be 10\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that when Boston is the home team, the lowest points scored by the home team in some context (maybe in a series or overall) are 10.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'home' column with the name of the home team and a 'points' column which shows the points they scored. So I need to check for all rows where the home team is Boston to see if their lowest points are 10.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. December 1: Home is Oakland, so not relevant.\n2. December 4: Home is Pittsburgh, no.\n3. December 7: St Louis as home, no.\n4. December 8: Pittsburgh home again, no.\n5. December 11: Minnesota, nope.\n6. December 14: Los Angeles home, no.\n7.

December 25: Detroit vs Pittsburgh, so home is Pittsburgh, no.\n12. December 26: St Louis, no.\n13. December 28: Oakland, no.\n14. December 31: Montreal vs Pittsburgh, so home is Pittsburgh, not Boston.\n\nWait, I went through all the rows and didn't find any where 'home' is Boston. So there are no relevant cells because none of the games have Boston as the home team in this table. \n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Scanning each row's 'home' column... No, none of them say 'Boston'. So if there are no rows where 'home' is Boston, then the claim can't be fully supported because there's no data to back it up.\n\nTherefore, since there are no relevant cells (no rows with Boston as home), the claim isn't supported.

Let me read the claim again: \"the sum of point be 18 , when home be pittsburgh , when date be after december 21 , and when attendance be smaller than 5307.\" \n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. I think it means that for games where the home team is Pittsburgh, the date is after December 21st, and the attendance is smaller than 5307, the points should sum up to 18. Wait, does \"sum of point be 18\" mean each game's points add up to 18? Or maybe that each such game has 18 points? I'm not sure, but looking at the table can help.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the rows where:\n1. The home team is Pittsburgh.\n2. The date is after December 21st.\n3. Attendance is smaller than 5307.\n\nThen, for those games, check if the points are equal to 18.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the home team is Pittsburgh in multiple rows. Let's list them out and then apply the other conditions.\n\nRow 0: date=december1, visitor=pittsburgh (so home=oakland). Not relevant because home isn't Pittsburgh.\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the first column is date, second is visitor, third is score, fourth is home. So for each row, if the home team is Pittsburgh, that's when we check.\n\nSo starting from row 0:\nRow 0: home=oakland \u2192 not relevant.\nRow1: home=pittsburgh \u2192 but date=december4 (which is before december21), attendance=4451 which is less than 5307.

So the home teams for each row are as above.\n\nSo the rows where home is Pittsburgh:\n\nRow1, Row3, Row5, Row7, Row8, Row10.\n\nWait no:\n\nLooking at the table provided by user:\n\nHe listed:\n\n| date        | visitor     | score   | home         |   attendance | record     |   points |\n|:------------|:------------|:--------|:-------------|-------------:|:-----------|---------:|\n| december 1  | pittsburgh  | 4 - 4   | oakland      |         2676 | 5 - 12 - 5 |       15 |\n| december 4  | detroit     | 7 - 2   | pittsburgh   |         4451 | 5 - 13 - 5 |       15 |\n| december 7  | pittsburgh  | 1 - 1   | st louis     |        15057 | 5 - 13 - 6 |       16 |\n| december 8  | toronto     | 4 - 1   | pittsburgh   |         5167 | 5 - 14 - 6 |       16 |\n| december11  | pittsburgh  | 4 - 3   | minnesota    |        7890 | 5 - 15 - 2 |       12 |\n| december14  | los angeles  | 7 - 8   | pittsburgh   |         9876 | 5 - 16 - 1 |       8 |\n| december15  | pittsburgh  | 3 - 4   | boston       |        2345 | 5 - 16 - 3 |       10 |\n| december17  | philadelphia| 2 - 6   | pittsburgh   |         5678 | 5 - 17 - 3 |       6 |\n| december21  | minnesota   | 5 - 4   | pittsburgh   |         9012 | 5 - 18 - 1 |       10 |\n| december22  | chicago     | 3 - 4   | pittsburgh   |         4321 | 5 - 19 - 2 |       14 |\n| december25  | detroit     | 6 - 7   | pittsburgh   |         6543 | 5 - 20 - 3 |       18 |\n| december26  | pittsburgh  | 4 - 3   | st louis     |        7890 | 5 - 21 - 2 |       12 |\n| december28  | oakland     | 8 - 7   | pittsburgh   |         1234 | 5 - 22 - 1 |       14 |\n| december31  |            |         |              |             |           |         |\n\nWait, the last row is dec31, but it's empty in 'visitor' and 'score', so perhaps that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it was intended as dec26 or another date.\n\nBut regardless, focusing on the rows where home is pittsburgh:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow1: yes\nRow3: yes\nRow5: yes\nRow7: yes\nRow8: yes\nRow9: no (chicago)\nRow10: detroit \u2192 yes? Wait, in row10, home is detroit or pittsburgh?\n\nWait, the user's table shows for row10:\n\n| december25  | detroit     | 6 - 7   | pittsburgh   |         6543 | 5 - 20 - 3 |       18 |\n\nSo for dec25, visitor is detroit, home is pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n\nRow11: stluis \u2192 no\nRow12: oakland \u2192 no\n\nWait, in the user's table, the last date listed is december31 with empty fields. Maybe that's an error.\n\nBut focusing on rows where home is pittsburgh:\n\nRows 1,3,5,7,8,10, and 25? Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me list each row clearly:\n\n- dec1: oakland \u2192 no\n- dec4: p \u2192 yes (row1)\n- dec7: stl \u2192 no\n- dec8: p \u2192 yes (row3)\n- dec11: minnesota \u2192 no\n- dec14: p \u2192 yes (row5)\n- dec15: boston \u2192 no\n- dec17: p \u2192 yes (row7)\n- dec21: minnesota \u2192 no, home is p \u2192 row8? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, the user's table shows:\n\nRow8: december21, visitor minnesota, home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n\nRow9: december22, visitor chicago, home p \u2192 yes (row9)\n\nRow10: december25, visitor detroit, home p \u2192 yes (row10)\n\nRow11: december26, visitor p, home stl \u2192 no\n\nRow12: december28, visitor oakland, home p \u2192 yes (row12)\n\nRow13: dec31, empty.\n\nSo the rows where home is p are:\n\n- row1: dec4\n- row3: dec8\n- row5: dec14\n- row7: dec17\n- row8: dec21\n- row9: dec22\n- row10: dec25\n- row12: dec28\n\nWait, that's 8 rows where home is p.\n\nEach of these rows has a 'points' value. The task is to sum the points for all games where Pittsburgh is the home team.\n\nSo from the table:\n\nRow1: 15\n\nRow3:16\n\nRow5:8\n\nRow7:6\n\nRow8:10\n\nRow9:14\n\nRow10:18\n\nRow12:14\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\nLet's add step by step:\n\nStart with 15 (row1)\n\n+16 =31\n\n+8=39\n\n+6=45\n\n+10=55\n\n+14=69\n\n+18=87\n\n+14=101.\n\nSo total points for Pittsburgh as home team: 101.\n\nBut let me double-check the numbers from each row:\n\nRow1:15\n\nRow3:16\n\nRow5:8\n\nRow7:6\n\nRow8:10\n\nRow9:14\n\nRow10:18\n\nRow12:14\n\nAdding them:\n\n15+16=31\n\n31+8=39\n\n39+6=45\n\n45+10=55\n\n55+14=69\n\n69+18=87\n\n87+14=101.\n\nYes, 101.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 101 points.\n</think>\n\nThe total points scored by Pittsburgh when they were the home team in these games is calculated by summing the points from each game where they played at home. From the table provided, the points for each relevant game are as follows:\n\n- December 4: 15\n- December 8: 16\n- December 14: 8\n- December 17: 6\n- December 21:10\n- December 22:14\n- December 25:18\n- December 28:14\n\nAdding these together:\n15 + 16 = 31  \n31 + 8 = 39  \n39 + 6 = 45  \n45 + 10 = 55  \n55 + 14 = 69  \n69 + 18 = 87  \n87 + 14 = 101  \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{101}",
