    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"south sydney rabbitohs be the premier team that play in the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The columns are points, score, premiers, runners up, and details. Each row represents a different grand final with specific details.\n\nI need to check if there's a row where both \"premiers\" and \"runners up\" match the claim, specifically about the team being south sydney rabbitohs in 1951 nswrfl grand final.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (row_index: 0) has points 42, score 42-14. Premiers are south sydney rabbitohs, runners up are manly - warringah sea eagles. Details mention 1951 nswrfl grand final.\n\nSo in this row, the premiers are indeed south sydney rabbitohs and it's the 1951 nswrfl grand final. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should check if any other rows might be relevant, but since the claim specifically refers to 1951, I can focus on that row. No need to consider other years or teams because they don't relate to this particular claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row 0, column \"premiers\" and maybe also \"details\" if needed, but the claim is about premiers being a specific team in 1951, so both columns might be relevant. However, since the claim doesn't mention anything about runners up or the score, only the team and the year, the key columns are premiers and possibly details to confirm the year.\n\nWait, actually, the claim could be referring to the team's participation as premiers in that specific final, so both \"premiers\" and \"details\" might be relevant. The \"details\" column confirms the event is indeed the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 0, column_name: \"premiers\"\n- row_index: 0, column_name: \"details\"\n\nI think both are necessary because they directly address the team being the premiers and the event in question. So I should include both in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"premiers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"details\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the brisbane bronco score 38 points in the 1998 nrl grand final.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. It has columns: points, score, premiers, runners up, and details. Each row represents a different event with corresponding data.\n\nThe claim mentions Brisbane Broncos scoring 38 points in the 1998 NRL grand final. So I need to look for the row where premiers are Brisbane Broncos and the year is 1998 with their points being 38.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Premiers - South Sydney Rabbitohs, Points - 42\n- Row 1: Premiers - Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Points - 40\n- Row 2: Premiers - Eastern Suburbs, Points - 38\n- Row 3: Premiers - Brisbane Broncos, Points - 38 (this seems relevant)\n- Row 4: Premiers - Canberra Raiders, Points - 36\n\nThe claim mentions the year 1998 and Brisbane Broncos. So row 3's details say \"1998 nrl grand final,\" which matches the year in the claim. The points for that row are 38, so that matches as well.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in row 3 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells in the table support the claim. Brisbane Broncos scored 38 points in the 1998 NRL grand final.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"premiers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"details\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the claim: \"the eastern suburb score 38 point , and win 38 - 0.\" So the main points here are that there's an Eastern Suburb team with a score of 38 points and they won by a margin of 38-0.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table. The table has five rows, each representing a different match or event. Each row includes points, score, premiers, runners up, and details. \n\nI need to check if any row matches the claim's conditions. So, looking for an Eastern Suburb team where their points are 38 and they won with a score of 38-0.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First row: Points 42, Score 42-14, Premiers South Sydney Rabbitohs, Runners up Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Details about 1951 NSWRL grand final.\n   - Doesn't match because the team isn't Eastern Suburb and the score is different.\n\n2. Second row: Points 40, Score 40-0, Premiers Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Runners up Melbourne Storm, Details about 2008 NRL grand final.\n   - The score here is 40-0, but the team is Manly-Warringah, not Eastern Suburb.\n\n3. Third row: Points 38, Score 38-0, Premiers Eastern Suburbs, Runners up St George Dragons, Details about 1975 NSWRL grand final.\n   - This seems to match exactly: Eastern Suburbs scored 38 points and won 38-0.\n\n4. Fourth row: Points 38, Score 38-12, Premiers Brisbane Broncos, Runners up Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details about 1998 NRL grand final.\n   - Here, the score is different (38-12), so it doesn't match the claim of a 38-0 win.\n\n5. Fifth row: Points 36, Score 36-12, Premiers Canberra Raiders, Runners up Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details about 1994 NSWRL grand final.\n   - Doesn't match because points and score are different.\n\nSo, only the third row matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant columns here are 'premiers' and their corresponding 'points'. In the third row, the premiers are Eastern Suburbs, points 38, score 38-0. So the relevant_cells should include row index 2 (since it's zero-based) for both 'points' and 'score'.\n\nWait, let me double-check the indices: The first row is index 0, so third row would be index 2? No, wait. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\nRow 3: index 2\nRow 4: index 3\nRow 5: index 4\n\nYes, that's correct. So the relevant cells are row_index 2 for both 'points' and 'score' columns.\n\nSo, the JSON object should include answer as \"TRUE\" and the two relevant cells with row indices 2 for each column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"south sydney rabbitohs score 42 point but lose the game during the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. Each row seems to represent a different instance, with points, score, premiers, runners up, and details.\n\nLooking for south sydney rabbitohs as the premiers (since they are winning the grand final if that's their category). From the table, south sydney rabbitohs appear in the first row under \"premiers\" column. That row has 42 points, with a score of 42-14.\n\nNow, checking the details for that row: it says \"1951 nswrfl grand final.\" So the game was the 1951 NSWRFL Grand Final.\n\nThe claim mentions that south sydney scored 42 points but lost the game. Wait, if they were the premiers, does that mean they won? Yes, being premiers implies winning the competition. But the details say they lost during the grand final. That doesn't make sense because if they are the premiers, they should have won, not lost.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. The table shows they scored 42 points and were the premiers in that game, which suggests they won. However, the claim says they lost despite scoring 42 points. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that south sydney rabbitohs scored 42 points but lost the 1951 nswrfl grand final.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"the brisbane bronco score a total of 12 point against canterbury - bankstown bulldog.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several rows, each representing different games with varying points and details. Each row includes points, the score difference, the premiers (winners), runners up, and the specific game details.\n\nThe claim is about a game where Brisbane Broncos scored 12 points against Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. So I need to check if such a game exists in the table.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row: Points 42, score difference 14, Premiers South Sydney Rabbitohs vs Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in 1951.\n2. Second row: Points 40, score 0-0, Manly against Melbourne Storm in 2008.\n3. Third row: Points 38, score 0, Eastern Suburbs vs St George Dragons in 1975.\n4. Fourth row: Points 38, score difference 12, Brisbane Broncos vs Canterbury Bulldogs in 1998.\n5. Fifth row: Points 36, score 12-12, Canberra Raiders against Bulldogs in 1994.\n\nThe fourth row is the one that stands out because it mentions Brisbane Broncos scoring 12 points against Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the 1998 NRL grand final. This matches the claim exactly, as it's about a game where Brisbane scored 12 points against the Bulldogs.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the row for Brisbane Broncos and their score against the Bulldogs. That would be row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0) and the column for points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the fourth row in the table, which confirms that the Brisbane Broncos scored 12 points against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog score 36 point at the 1994 nswrl grand final.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see if any row matches all the details in the claim. Let me go through each column and check.\n\nThe columns are points, score, premiers, runners up, and details. The claim mentions \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog\" as the team name, 36 points, at the 1994 nswrl grand final.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n1. First row: Points is 42, scored against South Sydney Rabbitohs. Premiers are South Sydney, runners up are Manly. Details mention 1951 NSWRFL Grand Final. Doesn't match the claim.\n\n2. Second row: 40 points against Manly. Premiers are Manly, runners up Melbourne Storm. Details 2008 NRL GF. Not matching.\n\n3. Third row: 38 points vs St George Dragons. Premiers Eastern Suburbs, runners up St George. 1975 NSWRFL GF. No match.\n\n4. Fourth row: 38 points vs Canterbury Bulldogs. Wait, no, the fourth row says Brisbane Broncos as premiers and Bulldogs as runners up. Score is 38-12, details are 1998 NRL GF. Doesn't match because the claim has 36 points and 1994 nswrl.\n\n5. Fifth row: Points 36, scored against Canterbury Bulldogs, premiers Canberra Raiders, runners up Canterbury Bulldogs. Details: 1994 NSWRL Grand Final. \n\nSo the fifth row seems to have some matching details. Let's check each part:\n\n- Team name: The claim is \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog.\" In the table, it's written as \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs\" in the fourth row but that's runners up. Wait, the fifth row's team is also Bulldogs? Wait no, the fifth row has Canberra Raiders as premiers and Bulldogs as runners up.\n\nWait, in the fifth row:\n\nPremiers: Canberra Raiders\n\nRunners up: Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs\n\nPoints: 36-12\n\nDetails: 1994 NSWRL Grand Final.\n\nSo the claim says \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog score 36 points at the 1994 nswrl grand final.\"\n\nIn the table, the fifth row has the team as Bulldogs (runners up), scored 36 points, in the 1994 NSWRL GF. So that matches the claim except that in the table it's \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs\" which is plural, but maybe that's a typo.\n\nWait, no, the claim uses \"bulldog\" singular, but the team name in the table is \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs.\" So does that matter? Maybe not. The main points are:\n\n- Team: Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs (whether plural or singular)\n- Score: 36\n- Grand Final: 1994 NSWRL\n\nSo all these elements match the claim, except for the name having an 's' in the table.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog\" without the 's.' So is that a discrepancy?\n\nI think so. The table has \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs,\" plural, while the claim uses singular. That might be an issue because the team name should match exactly. But sometimes in tables, team names might have variations or plural forms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just a formatting difference. Let me check:\n\nIn the fifth row, under runners up, it's \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs.\" So that's plural. The claim uses singular: \"bulldog.\"\n\nSo does that make the claim incorrect because the team is referred to as Bulldogs (plural) in the table? Or is the name \"bulldog\" acceptable?\n\nWait, in the claim, it's \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog,\" which might be a misspelling. Maybe they meant \"bulldogs.\" But regardless, the main points are:\n\n- Score: 36\n- Grand Final: 1994 NSWRL\n\nWhich match the fifth row.\n\nSo even though there's a plural vs singular issue in the team name, the essential information in the claim is present in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because all the required elements (team, points, and grand final) are correctly represented, even if there's a minor difference in pluralization.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches the fifth row of the table where the Bulldogs scored 36 points at the 1994 NSWRL Grand Final.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"details\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
