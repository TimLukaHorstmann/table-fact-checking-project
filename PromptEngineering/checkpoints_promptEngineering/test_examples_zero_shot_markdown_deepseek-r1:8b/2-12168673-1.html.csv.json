    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , and et al be the owner when blueeyesintherein be the winner in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with columns: year, winner, jockey, trainer, owner, and time.\n\nThe claim is about two specific pieces of information from the table:\n1. The horse \"blueeyesintherein\" was the winner in the year 2012.\n2. The owner at that time was \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\"\n\nSo I'll need to check both parts.\n\nStarting with the first part: Was blueeyesintherein the winner in 2012? Looking at the table, the year 2012 row is indeed where this horse won. The other details seem to match as well. So that's correct.\n\nNext, verifying the owner for that year and winner. In the 2012 row, under the \"owner\" column, it says: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. Both conditions of the claim are fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- In 2012, blueeyesintherein was the winner.\n- The owner for that race is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\"\n\nBoth conditions are met.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"overbrook farm and et al own winner blueeyesintherein after 2009.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main things: the owner is \"overbrook farm and et al\" and the winner is \"blueeyesintherein,\" which must have won a race after 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1995 to 2012. The columns include the year, winner, jockey, trainer, owner, and time. \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find the row where the winner is \"blueeyesintherein\" and check if the owner listed there is \"overbrook farm and et al,\" and also ensure that the year is after 2009.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- 2012: Winner is blueeyesintherein. Owner is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" That doesn't match \"overbrook farm and et al.\"\n- 2011, 2010, etc.: I don't see the winner's name changing; it seems consistent for each year.\n\nWait, looking back, in 2012, the owner is not overbrook. Let me double-check: 2012 row shows the winner as blueeyesintherein and the owner as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" So that's different from overbrook farm. \n\nIs there any other year where this might be true? The claim says \"after 2009,\" so I should only consider years 2010 and later. From the table, in 2012, it's the same winner but a different owner.\n\nSo, blueeyesintherein won in 2012 with overbrook farm not being the owner. Therefore, the claim is false because the owner isn't listed as \"overbrook farm and et al\" for that year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"overbrook farm and et al own winner blueeyesintherein after 2009.\" By checking the table, we find that in 2012 (the most recent relevant year), blueeyesintherein's owner is not overbrook farm. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"owner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et all own winner flashy lassie after 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions that a group of people (self, king, morgenson, travis, etc.) own the winner called \"flashy lassie\" after the year 2009. So, I need to check if there's an entry in the table where \"flashy lassie\" was the winner, owned by that group, and occurred after 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a year, winner, jockey, trainer, owner, and time. The columns of interest here are \"winner\", \"owner\", and \"year\". \n\nI need to find rows where:\n1. The winner is \"flashy lassie\".\n2. The owner includes \"self / king / morgenson / travis\" (and possibly others).\n3. The year is after 2009.\n\nLet me go through each row starting from 2012 down, looking for \"flashy lassie\".\n\nStarting with 2012: Winner is \"blueeyesintherein\". Not the one.\n2011: \"flashy lassie\" is the winner here. Let's check the owner. The owner in 2011 is listed as \"barry l king\". Wait, that doesn't match the group mentioned in the claim. The claim says \"self / king / morgenson / travis\", but this row has only \"barry l king\" as the owner. So, not matching.\n\nNext, 2010: Winner is \"just louise\". Not relevant.\n2009: \"decelerator\". Not the winner we're looking for.\n2008: \"garden district\". No match.\n2007: \"rated fiesty\". Not the one.\n2006: \"richwoman\". No.\n2005: \"effectual\". No.\n2004: \"classic elegance\". No.\n2003: \"be gentle\". No.\n2002: \"awesome humor\". No.\n2001: \"cashier 's dream\". No.\n2000: \"gold mover\". No.\n1999: \"chilukki\". No.\n1998: \"silverbulletday\". No.\n1997: \"love lock\". No.\n1996: \"move\". No.\n1995: \"golden attraction\". No.\n\nSo, the only row where \"flashy lassie\" is the winner is in 2011. However, the owner for that row is \"barry l king\", which doesn't include \"self / king / morgenson / travis\". Therefore, it doesn't match the claim's condition of ownership by that group after 2009.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"after 2009,\" so I need to ensure that there's an occurrence after 2009. However, in the table, the latest year where \"flashy lassie\" is the winner is 2011. So, it's after 2009, but the owner doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because even though \"flashy lassie\" was the winner in 2011, which is after 2009, the owner listed (barry l king) does not align with the group stated in the claim. There's no row where both conditions are met: ownership by self/king/morgenson/travis and winning after 2009.\n\nWait another thing\u2014looking back at the table, in 2012, the winner is \"blueeyesintherein\", owner is \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". So that's a row where the group owns the winner, but not \"flashy lassie\". Therefore, for \"flashy lassie\" to have been owned by that group after 2009, it should have occurred in 2011 or later. But since \"flashy lassie\" only won in 2011 and the owner is different, there's no such row where both conditions are true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et all own winner flashy lassie after 2009.\" After examining the table, \"flashy lassie\" won in 2011 with an owner listed as \"barry l king,\" not matching the claim's ownership group. No rows meet both conditions: winning by \"flashy lassie\" and owned by the specified group after 2009.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"owner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
