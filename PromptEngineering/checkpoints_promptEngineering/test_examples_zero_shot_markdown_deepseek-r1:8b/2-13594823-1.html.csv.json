Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the song 'nu idag' receive more point than 'nattens \u00e4nglar'\". So, I'm supposed to check two things: the name of the song and its corresponding points compared to another song's points.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the song is \"nu idag\". Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: song is \"nu idag\" with 11 points.\n2. Then row 2: song is \"nattens \u00e4nglar\" with 0 points.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row 1 (since it's the first part of the claim) and row 2 (to compare against).\n\nFor the claim to be true, the points for \"nu idag\" should be higher than those for \"nattens \u00e4nglar\". Looking at their points: \"nu idag\" has 11 points, while \"nattens \u00e4nglar\" has 0. Since 11 is greater than 0, this supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, I'll include these two rows in relevant cells because they directly relate to the comparison made.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant columns here seem to be \"song\" and \"place.\"\n\nThe song in question is \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5,\" which is mentioned first in the claim.

The place for this entry is \"2nd.\" So the song is placed 2nd.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says \"be place right after bara hon \u00e4lskar mig.\" Let's look at \"bara hon \u00e4lskar mig,\" which is in row 12 with place \"1st.\"\n\nSo, the claim suggests that \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" should be placed right after \"bara hon \u00e4lskar mig.\" However, in the table, \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is at 2nd place and \"bara hon \u00e4lskar mig\" is at 1st. That means it's immediately after in terms of placement since 2 comes right after 1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim says the song should be placed right after \"bara hon \u00e4lskar mig,\" which is in 1st place. So if we look at the order, row 12 (place 1st) is followed by row 4 (place 2nd), so yes, it's directly after.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold true based on their positions in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" should be placed right after \"bara hon \u00e4lskar mig.\" In the table, \"bara hon \u00e4lskar mig\" is ranked 1st and \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is ranked 2nd.

The claim says: \"the song world wide web be place right after en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. Let's break it down.\n\nThe song mentioned is \"world wide web.\" Looking at the table, I need to find which row has this song. Scanning through the 'song' column:\n\n- Row 6: world wide web by Nick Borgen.\n\nSo, the relevant cell for the song is row 6, song column.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"be place right after.\" This means that the song should be in a position (place) that comes directly after where another specific song is placed. The other song mentioned here is \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" which translates to \"Once he will cry.\"\n\nLooking through the 'song' column again, I check if this song exists in the table:\n\n- Row 8: en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta by Garmarna.\n\nSo, the relevant cell for \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is row 8, song column.\n\nNow, the claim states that \"world wide web\" should be placed right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta.\" So I need to check their positions (place) in the table.\n\nFrom the 'place' column:\n\n- \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is in 8th place (row 8).\n- \"world wide web\" is in 9th place (row 6).\n\nWait, that's not right. Row 6 is actually placed at 9th, which comes after 8th. So yes, it is right after.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the order of rows. The table seems to be ordered from row 1 to 12, but I need to confirm if the place corresponds to the actual position in the list or if there's a specific placement order based on points or something else. But looking at the 'place' column:\n\nRow 6: 9th\nRow 8: 8th\n\nSo yes, \"world wide web\" is indeed placed right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, but the relevant_cells should list all cells that are relevant. So, for the song 'world wide web,' it's row 6, and the other song is row 8. The place column for both rows 6 and 8 are 9th and 8th respectively.

Let me scan through each row to locate the relevant ones.\n\nRow 1: The song is \"nu idag\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Song is \"nattens \u00e4nglar\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Song is \"hand i hand.\" Not matching.\nRow 4: \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" \u2013 no.\nRow 5: The song here is \"charlie.\" That's one of the songs in question.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instruction. The claim says: \"missarna be placed right after d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It sounds like it's saying that the song \"missarna\" by wille craaford comes right after the song \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" by n - mix in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a draw number, artist, song title, points, and place. So I need to find where both these songs are located. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: monia sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, \"nu idag\", 11th place.\n- Row 2: photogenique, \"nattens \u00e4nglar\", 12th.\n- Row 3: robert randqvist, \"hand i hand\", 5th.\n- Row 4: n - mix, \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\", 2nd place. So this is the song in question.\n- Row 5: jim jidhed, \"charlie\", 10th.\n- Row 6: nick borgen, \"world wide web\", 9th.\n- Row 7: andreas lundstedt, \"jag saknar dig , jag saknar dig\", 7th.\n- Row 8: garmarna, \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", 8th.\n- Row 9: big, \"jag skall aldrig l\u00e4mna dig\", 6th.\n- Row 10: wille craaford, \"missarna\", 3rd place. So this is the other song in question.\n\nNow, I need to see if \"missarna\" comes right after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" Looking at their draw numbers:\n\nThe \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is row 4 (draw 4), and \"missarna\" is row 10. So the order in terms of placement would require \"missarna\" to come immediately after row 4, but here it's much later, at row 10.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the place column: \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is in 2nd place, and \"missarna\" is in 3rd. So in terms of placement within their positions, yes, \"missarna\" comes right after it in the 3rd position. But wait, does that mean immediately after? Because in the table, each entry is a separate song, so 2nd place followed by 3rd would be next in order.\n\nBut looking at the draw numbers: row 4 and row 10 are not consecutive. So there might be some confusion here. The claim says \"be placed right after,\" which could refer to their placement in the competition rather than their draw order.\n\nIn terms of placement, \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is 2nd, and \"missarna\" is 3rd. That would mean yes, it's right after in terms of placement. But I'm not sure if \"placement\" refers to the competition standings or their order in the table.\n\nWait, looking at the original instruction: the claim is about where each song is placed, so maybe it's about their ranking. So 2nd place followed by 3rd would be right after. Therefore, the claim might be TRUE because \"missarna\" is indeed in 3rd place, right after 2nd.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes \"right after\" can mean immediately following in sequence, like draw order. In that case, since they have different draw numbers (4 and 10), it's not right after. But if it's about placement in the competition results, then yes, it is.\n\nSo which interpretation is correct? The table has a column called \"place,\" so maybe it refers to their ranking positions rather than the order in the table. So if one is 2nd and the other is 3rd, they are consecutive in rank, thus placed right after each other.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because \"missarna\" is placed right after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" in terms of their competition placement.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"}]}",

There's no row 13 or higher, so we can't determine if it follows any other song here.\n\nLooking at the 'song' column:\n\n- Song A is in row 4.\n- Before that, there are rows with places from 2nd to 12th, but none directly after 1st (Song B's place).\n\nSo, the claim seems incorrect because:\n- Song A isn't placed right after Song B.\n- There's no way for another song to follow in the given table.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the song nu idag receive more point than nattens \u00e4nglar and charlie.\" So, I'm looking for information about two songs: \"nu idag\" and \"charlie.\" The claim is comparing their points to those of another song called \"nattens \u00e4nglar.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different song with details like draw number, artist name, song title, points, and placement. I need to find the rows corresponding to these three songs: nu idag, nattens \u00e4nglar, and charlie.\n\nStarting with \"nu idag\": Scanning through the table, I see in row 1 (draw 1), the song is \"nu idag\" by monia sj\u00f6str\u00f6m. The points for this entry are 11. So that's one relevant cell: row index 1, column 'points'.\n\nNext, \"nattens \u00e4nglar\": Looking through the table, I find this in row 2 (draw 2), where it's performed by photogenique and has 0 points. Another relevant cell is row index 2, column 'points'.\n\nLastly, \"charlie\": This song appears in row 5 (draw 5) by jim jidhed. The points here are 12. So another relevant cell is row index 5, column 'points'.\n\nNow, the claim says that \"nu idag\" receives more points than both \"nattens \u00e4nglar and charlie.\" Comparing their points: nu idag has 11, nattens \u00e4nglar has 0, and charlie has 12. So, does nu idag have more points than both?\n\nComparing 11 to 0 is true since 11 > 0. But comparing 11 to 12, it's false because 11 < 12. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported as \"nu idag\" doesn't have more points than charlie.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"more point than nattens \u00e4nglar and charlie.\" So does that mean nu idag has to have more points than each of them individually? Or is it compared to the total or combined points?\n\nIf we interpret it as having more points than both individually, then since 11 > 0 but 11 < 12, it's only true for one and false for the other. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if the comparison is that nu idag has more points than the sum or combined points of nattens \u00e4nglar and charlie, but I don't think that's the case here because each song's points are separate and likely compared individually.\n\nSo, in conclusion, since \"nu idag\" doesn't have higher points than both \"nattens \u00e4nglar\" (which has 0) and \"charlie\" (12), the claim is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we compare the 'points' column for the songs \"nu idag,\" \"nattens \u00e4nglar,\" and \"charlie.\" \n\n- \"nu idag\" has 11 points.\n- \"nattens \u00e4nglar\" has 0 points.\n- \"charlie\" has 12 points.\n\nThe claim states that \"nu idag\" has more points than both, but since it doesn't exceed \"charlie's\" 12 points, the claim is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells are where these songs' points are located in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"missarna , sang by blond be place right after d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" I'll translate this into Swedish for better understanding: \"Missarna, sung by Blond, should be placed right after 'D\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5'.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find relevant cells related to the claim. The columns involved here are:\n\n1. **song**: This refers to the song titles.\n2. **artist**: This is the artist who sang the song.\n3. **place**: This indicates the position of the song in a competition or ranking.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific songs: \"missarna\" and \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" I'll find their corresponding rows.\n\nStarting with \"missarna\": \n- Scanning through the 'song' column, I see it's listed in row 10. The artist for this entry is Blond, and they got the 3rd place (column: place).\n\nNext, looking for \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\":\n- This song is listed in row 4. The artist here is N - mix, and they achieved 2nd place.\n\nThe claim states that \"missarna\" should be placed right after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" So I need to check the positions of these songs relative to each other.\n\nIn the 'place' column:\n- \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is in 2nd place.\n- \"missarna\" is in 3rd place.\n\nYes, \"missarna\" is right after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" because it's the next position. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on their placements.\n\nHowever, I should also check if Blond actually sang \"missarna.\" Looking at row 10, yes, Blond is indeed the artist for that song. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as \"missarna\" by Blond is listed in 3rd place immediately after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" in 2nd place.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the song world wide web be place right after en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta and charlie\". I'll try to parse what it's saying. It seems like it's stating that two songs are adjacent in order: \"world wide web\" should come immediately after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", followed by \"charlie\". Alternatively, it could mean both \"world wide web\" comes right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" and separately, \"charlie\" is also placed somewhere else. I need to check the table for these details.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a draw number, artist, song, points, and place. The relevant columns here are 'song' and 'place'. The claim is about the order of songs based on their placement in the competition.\n\nI'll start by identifying where \"world wide web\" and \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" are located. \n\nFrom the table:\n- The song \"world wide web\" is in row 6, with the artist Nick Borgen.\n- The song \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is in row 8, by the group Garmarna.\n\nNow, I need to see where these two songs are placed. Their 'place' column values are:\n\n- For \"world wide web\": 9th place.\n- For \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\": 8th place.\n\nWait a minute. If \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is in 8th place, and \"world wide web\" is in 9th place, they are consecutive but in the order of 8th then 9th. So, \"world wide web\" comes right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\". That part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"charlie\". Looking through the table, I need to find if there's a song named \"charlie\". Scanning each row:\n\nRow 5: charlie\nYes, \"charlie\" is in row 5 by Jim Jidhed.\n\nNow, where is \"charlie\" placed? The 'place' column for this entry is 10th place.\n\nThe claim says that \"world wide web\" should be right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", and then \"charlie\". So, the order would be 8th, 9th, 10th. That seems to fit because \"world wide web\" is in 9th and \"charlie\" is in 10th.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there's another song between them or not. Looking at row 8: en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta (8th), then row 9: jag skall aldrig l\u00e4mna dig (6th place). Wait, no, the 'draw' number is sequential, but the 'place' numbers are their rankings.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe table lists each song's placement as per their draw number. So the 'place' column indicates where they ended up in the competition. For example, a higher place number means a lower rank (e.g., 1st is highest, 12th is lowest). Wait no, actually, looking at the data:\n\nRow 12 has \"bara hon \u00e4lskar mig\" in 1st place.\n\nSo, lower numbers in the 'place' column mean better rankings. So 1st place is the best, 12th is the worst.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 1st is higher than 2nd, etc. So if a song has a lower number in 'place', it's better. For example, 1st is the top position, then 2nd, up to 12th.\n\nSo, for \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", place is 8th. That means they came 8th in the competition. Then \"world wide web\" is 9th, so it's after that. So yes, they are adjacent.\n\nThen, where is \"charlie\"? It's in 10th place, which is after both of them. So \"world wide web\" is right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", and then \"charlie\" comes later. The claim says \"right after en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta and charlie\". Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. It could mean that both are placed after each other, but perhaps it's trying to say that \"world wide web\" comes right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", and separately, \"charlie\" is somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me parse it again: \"the song world wide web be place right after en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta and charlie\". So it's saying that \"world wide web\" is placed right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", and also that \"charlie\" is placed somewhere, perhaps in relation to these two.\n\nBut more accurately, the claim could be read as: \"world wide web comes right after en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta, and charlie is also placed.\" So both placements are happening.\n\nIn the table, \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is 8th, \"world wide web\" is 9th, so they are consecutive. Then, \"charlie\" is in 10th place, which is after both. So all three are in a row: 8th, 9th, 10th.\n\nSo the claim is stating that these two songs (\"world wide web\" and \"charlie\") are placed right after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", but wait, no\u2014the claim says \"the song world wide web be place right after en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta and charlie\". So it's possible that the intended meaning is that both songs come immediately after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" and then \"charlie\" follows. But that might not make sense because \"world wide web\" is in 9th place, right after \"en g\u00e5ng...\", which is correct. Then \"charlie\" is in 10th, so both are placed consecutively.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"right after en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta and charlie\". The phrasing is a bit confusing. Alternatively, it might mean that \"world wide web\" comes right after \"en g\u00e5ng...\", and \"charlie\" also comes right after somewhere else. But according to the table, both are placed after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that \"world wide web\" is immediately after \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", and then \"charlie\" is placed as well. So in terms of placement, 8th, 9th, 10th\u2014so yes, both are after \"en g\u00e5ng...\".\n\nSo, the key points:\n\n- \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is 8th place.\n\n- \"world wide web\" is 9th place (right after).\n\n- \"charlie\" is 10th place (after both).\n\nTherefore, all three placements are correct as per the table. So the claim holds: \"world wide web\" is right after \"en g\u00e5ng...\", and \"charlie\" is placed later.\n\nSo the data in the table supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is supported by the data provided:\n\n- \"En g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is ranked 8th.\n- \"World Wide Web\" is ranked 9th, immediately following.\n- \"Charlie\" is ranked 10th, continuing the sequence.\n\nThus, both placements align with the claim.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen have more points than charlie and d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe table has several columns: draw, artist, song, points, and place. The rows go from 1 to 12, with each row representing a different entry.\n\nThe claim mentions two songs:\n\n1. \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen\"\n2. \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\"\n\nI need to find where these songs are located in the table and check their points.\n\nLooking through the 'song' column, I can scan each row until I find a match.\n\nStarting from row 1:\n\nRow 1: song is \"nu idag\" \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 2: \"nattens \u00e4nglar\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: \"hand i hand\" \u2013 no.\nRow 4: \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" \u2013 yes, this is the second song. Its row index is 4.\n\nNow for the first part of the claim, \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen.\" I need to find that song in the table. Scanning again:\n\nRow 1: nope.\nRow 2: nope.\n...\nContinuing until I reach row 12.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, I notice that row 11 has \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen\" as the song. So its row index is 11.\n\nSo now, the two songs are at row indices 4 and 11. The claim states that \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen\" has more points than both \"charlie\" and \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\"\n\nFirst, let's check \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" From row 4, the points are 68.\n\nNext, \"charlie\" is a song. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: nu idag\nRow 2: nattens \u00e4nglar\n...\nWait, I might have missed it. Let me check all rows carefully.\n\nLooking at row 5: \"charlie.\" So that's the song. Its points are 12.\n\nSo now, comparing the two songs:\n\n- \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen\" is in row 11 with points 56.\n- \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is in row 4 with points 68.\n- \"charlie\" is in row 5 with points 12.\n\nThe claim says that \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen\" has more points than both \"charlie\" (which it does, 56 > 12) and \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" (but here, 56 < 68). So the first part is false because it doesn't have more points than the second song. \n\nWait, no. The claim says \"have more points than charlie AND d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel...\" which implies both conditions must be true. Since it's not higher than the second song, the entire statement is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me double-check the claim: \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen have more point[sic] than charlie and d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\" So it's comparing \"hel igen\" to both \"charlie\" and \"en \u00e4ngel.\" Since \"hel igen\" (56 points) is not higher than \"en \u00e4ngel\" (68), the claim is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify the relevant cells for these comparisons.\n\nFor \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen,\" it's row 11, column 'points' and 'song.'\n\nFor \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5,\" it's row 4, same columns.\n\nFor \"charlie,\" it's row 5, same columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the points and song columns for rows 4, 11, and 5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because \"du g\u00f6r mig hel igen\" does not have more points than both \"charlie\" and \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
