    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says that Adnan Al Talyani had the same score on November 9, 1994 as he did on December 10, 1996.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the column names in the table: date, venue, score, result, competition. The relevant columns for the scores are \"score\" and perhaps \"result,\" but the claim specifically mentions the same score, so probably just \"score.\"\n\nNow, I need to find the rows where the name Adnan Al Talyani is mentioned. Wait, looking at the table, the names aren't directly listed in the venue column. The venues include places like \"Islamabad\" and \"zayed sports city stadium,\" but I don't see any entries for Adnan Al Talyani as part of the venue. So maybe the name isn't directly in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is about the same player, not necessarily named in the table. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because without his name in the table, how can we compare his scores?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the competition column includes information that could link to Adnan Al Talyani. For example, \"1990 world cup qualification\" or similar might be related.\n\nWait, maybe the player's name isn't directly listed here, so perhaps the claim is about a specific match between those two dates. But without his name in the table, I can't verify it directly. So maybe the answer is false because we can't find any rows where he scored on both those dates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the table has entries for Adnan Al Talyani under a different column. Let me check each row.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n- 10 march 1984: venue is Muscat, competition is Gulf Cup.\n- 12 march 1984: same venue, same competition.\n- 4 december 1984: Singapore, Asian Cup.\n- 20 september 1985: Dubai, World Cup Qualification.\n\nWait, perhaps the name isn't in the table at all. So if Adnan Al Talyani is not mentioned anywhere in the table, then we can't confirm any scores for him. Therefore, comparing his scores on those two dates isn't possible because there's no data about him in the table.\n\nSo the claim would be false because there's no information linking Adnan Al Talyani to those specific dates and scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Adnan Al Talyani had the same score on November 9, 1994, as he did on December 10, 1996. Upon examining the table, there are no entries mentioning Adnan Al Talyani by name. Therefore, there is insufficient data to verify or contradict the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Adnan Al Talyani playing at the same amount of time in the 1996 Asian Cup as he did in the 1994 Gulf Cup is true or false. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It says that Adnan played the same amount of time in both the 1996 Asian Cup and the 1994 Gulf Cup. So, my task is to check if there's enough information in the provided table to support this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match or event where a team (and by extension, its players) participated. The columns include the date, venue, score, result, and competition. To determine how much time Adnan played in each of these competitions, I need to look for rows related to both the 1994 Gulf Cup and the 1996 Asian Cup where he was involved.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the table doesn't have any direct information about individual players' playing times. It only provides data on matches, scores, results, venues, dates, etc. So, I don't know how many minutes or games Adnan played in each of these competitions based solely on this table. \n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions Adnan Al Talyani. Since the table includes \"competition\" as a column, I can check if there are any matches for both the 1994 Gulf Cup and the 1996 Asian Cup that involve his team, which might indirectly indicate he was part of those games. But without specific information about his participation in each match or his playing time, it's hard to verify.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for rows where the competition is either the 1994 Gulf Cup or the 1996 Asian Cup and see if Adnan Al Talyani might have been involved in any of those matches. For instance, looking at the table:\n\n- In the 1994 Gulf Cup, there are two entries (3 November and 9 November). These could be matches that he played in.\n- In the 1996 Asian Cup, there are three entries (22 October, 7 December, 10 December), which might also involve him.\n\nBut again, without knowing how many minutes or games he played in each of these competitions, it's impossible to confirm if the time he spent was the same. The table only gives us match results and dates but not individual player participation details.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I can't verify whether Adnan Al Talyani played for the same amount of time in both competitions. The claim might be referring to the number of matches he participated in or the total minutes he played across those competitions. But without that data, it's impossible to confirm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Adnan Al Talyani played at the same amount of time in the 1996 Asian Cup as in the 1994 Gulf Cup, we need information about his participation in each competition.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for matches in both competitions where he might have participated.\n2. **Assess Data Availability**: The table lacks details on individual player playing times or match involvement beyond the team level.\n3. **Conclusion**: Without specific data on Adnan's minutes or games played, we cannot confirm the claim.\n\nThus, the claim cannot be fully supported with the given information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Adnan Al Talyani played at the 1984 Gulf Cup one more time than the 1984 Asian Cup.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find any matches involving Adnan Al Talyani in 1984.\n\nI'll start by scanning the 'competition' column for mentions of the 1984 Gulf Cup and the 1984 Asian Cup. \n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- The first two entries are for the 1984 Gulf Cup, but there's no mention of Adnan Al Talyani in those matches.\n\nMoving further down, I see a row on March 10, 1984, where the venue is Royal Oman Police Stadium in Muscat. However, the 'result' column shows a score of 1 - 0 and 2 - 0, but it's unclear if this is Adnan Al Talyani's match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row for any mention of Adnan Al Talyani. But in the provided table, there doesn't seem to be an explicit mention of his name. The 'result' column has scores like 1-0, 2-3, etc., but without names associated with them.\n\nSo, maybe the claim is about whether he played more times in the Gulf Cup than the Asian Cup in 1984.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Adnan Al Talyani is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Adnan Al Talyani play at the 1986 Gulf Cup two times more than at the 1988 Gulf Cup.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It's saying that Adnan played in the 1986 Gulf Cup twice as many times as he did in the 1988 Gulf Cup. So, I need to look for his participation in both competitions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, venue, score, result, and competition. The competitions are things like \"1984 Gulf Cup,\" \"1986 Gulf Cup,\" etc. \n\nI'm looking for two columns: one that shows how many times he played in 1986 and another in 1988. From the table, I can see the 'date' and 'competition' might be relevant. But there's also a 'result' which is about goals or points, but maybe not directly about the number of games.\n\nWait, no. The 'score' and 'result' columns show the match results, but they don't indicate how many times he played. So maybe I need to count the number of times his team played in each competition. But wait, it's about Adnan specifically, so I should look for his participation.\n\nBut the table doesn't have any information about players, only about matches and competitions. Hmm, that complicates things. So without knowing which specific games he played in, how can I determine how many times he participated in each Gulf Cup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'result' is a score, so if he scored goals or points, that might indicate the number of games he played. But that's not certain because players can have varying roles.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look for the number of matches his team had in 1986 and 1988 Gulf Cups. For example, if Adnan's team played twice as many times in 1986 compared to 1988, then he would have had more opportunities to play.\n\nBut that might not be directly accurate because playing time isn't just about the number of matches but individual appearances. Since the table doesn't specify players, I'm a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'result' is the goals scored or points earned, which could indirectly indicate how many games he played in. For example, if a team won 2-0, that might mean he scored once, suggesting he was on the field enough to contribute.\n\nBut without knowing the exact matches he played, this approach isn't reliable. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about the number of times he played in each Gulf Cup. If the table shows two matches for 1986 and one match for 1988, that's twice as many. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- In 1986 Gulf Cup: There are three entries: March 24, April 2, and April 7. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at each row:\n\n- The first entry is 1984, so not relevant.\n- 1985: two entries but for World Cup qualification, not Gulf Cup.\n- 1986 Gulf Cup starts with three rows: March 24, April 2, and April 7. So that's three matches in 1986.\n- Then in 1988 Gulf Cup: there's one match on March 17.\n\nSo if Adnan played in each of those matches, he would have played three times in 1986 and once in 1988. That\u2019s three times more than one, which is not twice as much. Wait, three times more than one is three, but the claim says two times more, so maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each match he plays in counts as one time. If he played twice in 1986 and once in 1988, then it's twice as many. But I don't see that in the table.\n\nWait, looking again: \n\nIn 1986 Gulf Cup, there are three matches listed on different dates (March 24, April 2, April 7). So if Adnan played in all of them, that's three times. In 1988 Gulf Cup, only one match. So three vs. one: that's triple the number, not double.\n\nBut maybe the claim is about the total goals or something else. However, the user specifically mentioned \"play at,\" so it's about participation.\n\nWait, but perhaps the table shows that in 1986, there are three matches, and in 1988, only one match. So if Adnan played in all, he played three times in 1986 and once in 1988. That\u2019s three times as much, not two times.\n\nSo the claim says \"two times more,\" meaning twice as many: so for example, two vs. one. But according to this, it's three vs. one. So that would make the claim false because it's three times more than one, which is not double.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the table again:\n\nLooking at the 'competition' column:\n\n- 1984 Gulf Cup (x2)\n- 1985 World Cup qualification (x3)\n- 1986 Gulf Cup (x3)\n- 1988 Gulf Cup (x1)\n\nSo in 1986, three matches. In 1988, one match.\n\nTherefore, if Adnan played in all, he appeared three times in 1986 and once in 1988. So that's three times more than one.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because it says two times more, but it's actually three times more.\n</think>\n\nThe user provided a table listing various matches across different competitions and years. The task was to determine whether Adnan Al Talyani played in the 1986 Gulf Cup twice as many times as he did in the 1988 Gulf Cup.\n\nFirst, I identified the relevant competitions: 1986 Gulf Cup and 1988 Gulf Cup. From the table, there are three matches listed under the 1986 Gulf Cup (March 24, April 2, and April 7) and one match under the 1988 Gulf Cup (March 17).\n\nAssuming Adnan participated in each of these matches, he would have played three times in 1986 and once in 1988. This means he played three times as many times in 1986 compared to 1988, not two times more.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that he played twice as many times in 1986, while the actual count is three times more.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.  \n**Relevant cells:** None (No specific data points about Adnan's participation are provided in the table to confirm the exact number of games played.)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

So rows with \"competition\" as \"1986 gulf cup\".\n\nThese are rows 7,8,9:\n\n- Row 7: March 24, 1986 \u2013 Bahrain National Stadium\n- Row 8: April 2, 1986 \u2013 same venue\n- Row 9: April 7, 1986 \u2013 same venue\n\nSo the relevant cells are row indices 7, 8, and 9.\n\nNext, we need to check if Adnan Al Talyani is listed as the player in any of these matches. Since I don't have the \"result\" or \"score\" columns' data on the players, but from the table, it's unclear. However, the problem states that the claim is about whether he played at those dates and venues for the specified competitions.\n\nAssuming that the table includes all necessary info, the relevant cells are rows 7,8,9 under 'date', 'venue', etc. But since we don't have player names in the table, perhaps the answer is based solely on the claim matching the competition and dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table doesn't list players, so without specific data about Adnan Al Talyani's participation, it's impossible to confirm from the given info. Therefore, the claim might not be fully supported because we can't verify his participation from the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is asserting that Adnan Al Talyani played in specific matches during the 1986 Gulf Cup on April 2 and April 7. Checking the table, these dates do correspond to matches in the 1986 Gulf Cup, but without information about the players involved, we can't confirm if he participated.\n\nHowever, since the task is to verify based solely on the table, and assuming that all necessary info is there, the relevant cells are identified as:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: The claim is not fully supported because the table doesn't provide details about the players in those matches, so we can't confirm Adnan Al Talyani's participation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim about Adnan Al Talyani playing at the 1996 Asian Cup twice as many times as he did in the 1994 Gulf Cup is true or false. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided to find any mentions of \"Adnan Al Talyani.\" Scanning each row, I see that there's a name listed for some matches, but none of them explicitly say \"Adnan Al Talyani.\" So that's confusing\u2014maybe he wasn't involved in any of these matches? \n\nWait, maybe the claim is about the number of times he played in the 1996 Asian Cup compared to the 1994 Gulf Cup. But if he didn't play in either, then the claim doesn't hold. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again. The table lists various matches, each with a date, venue, score, result, and competition. The competitions mentioned include the Gulf Cup, Asian Cup, World Cup qualification, etc. I need to check if there's any match in 1996 Asian Cup where Adnan Al Talyani played.\n\nLooking at the 1996 Asian Cup entries:\n- On October 22, 1996: Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex, Muscat. The score is 2-1, result is 2-1.\n- December 7, 1996: Zayed Sports City Stadium, Abu Dhabi. Score is 2-2, result is 3-2.\n- December 10, 1996: Same venue, score is 2-0, result is 2-0.\n\nNone of these have Adnan Al Talyani listed as the player. Similarly, checking the 1994 Gulf Cup entries:\n- March 3, 1994: Zayed Sports City Stadium, Abu Dhabi. Score is 1-0, result is 2-0.\n- November 9, 1994: Same venue, score is 2-0, result is 2-0.\n\nNo mention of Adnan Al Talyani here either. So if he didn't play in either cup, then comparing the number of times isn't possible because it's zero in both cases.

The claim says: \"Adnan Al Talyani played at the 1986 Gulf Club the same amount of time as the 1988 Gulf Club.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two Gulf Clubs: 1986 and 1988. Wait, looking back at the table, I don't see an entry for \"1988 gulf cup\" as a competition. The closest ones are 1986, 1990, 1994, etc. So maybe that's a clue.\n\nNext, the claim is about Adnan Al Talyani's playing time in both clubs. To verify this, I need to look for his matches in these years. \n\nLooking at the table, under each date and venue, there are results. For example, in 1986, the Gulf Cup had several matches. Similarly, in 1988, the Gulf Cup is mentioned. So perhaps Adnan played in both competitions.\n\nI should find all entries where the competition is \"1986 gulf cup\" or \"1988 gulf cup.\" Let's scan each row:\n\n- 10 March 1984: 1984 Gulf Cup\n- 12 March 1984: 1984 Gulf Cup\n- 4 Dec 1984: 1984 Asian Cup\n- 20 Sept 1985: 1986 World Cup Qualification\n- 27 Sept 1985: 1986 World Cup Qualification\n- 24 March 1986: 1986 Gulf Cup\n- 2 April 1986: 1986 Gulf Cup\n- 7 April 1986: 1986 Gulf Cup\n- 17 March 1988: 1988 Gulf Cup\n- 10 Feb 1989: 1990 World Cup Qualification\n\nWait, in 1988, there's a row with the competition \"1988 Gulf Cup,\" which is when Adnan would have played. But does he play in both 1986 and 1988 Gulf Cups? \n\nLooking for Adnan Al Talyani's matches:\n\nThe table includes players but doesn't specify all players each time. So I need to check if there are any rows where the competition is either \"1986 Gulf Club\" or \"1988 Gulf Club\" and see if he played in both.\n\nWait, actually, the claim says \"the same amount of time as the 1988 Gulf Club.\" So perhaps it's about how much he played in 1986 vs. 1988 Gulf Cups. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1986 Gulf Cup: matches on 24/3, 2/4, and 7/4.\nEach match is a separate game, so each row represents a single game.\n\nAdnan might have played multiple games in both competitions. If he played the same number of games in 1986 as in 1988, then it's true.\n\nIn 1986 Gulf Cup: there are three matches listed for that competition (rows 5,6,7). So if Adnan played all three or some specific number, we need to see how many times he was involved.\n\nSimilarly, in 1988 Gulf Cup: only one match is listed (row 9). \n\nBut wait, the claim is about time, not the number of games. Maybe it's about minutes played or something else, but given the data, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to the total duration each club was active during his participation.\n\nHowever, without knowing how many matches he started or played in each club, it's hard to determine time. But considering that 1986 Gulf Cup had multiple games and 1988 only one, the time spent might differ.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to the number of matches each club had during his participation. If both clubs had the same number of matches where he played, then the time would be the same. \n\nLooking again:\n\n- In 1986 Gulf Cup: three matches (rows 5,6,7)\n- In 1988 Gulf Cup: one match (row 9)\n\nSo the number of matches is different, meaning the time might not be the same. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if Adnan played in all those matches or only some. Maybe he didn't play in every game, so his playing time could still be the same across both clubs. But without specific data on his participation per match, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because the 1988 Gulf Club isn't a separate entity but part of the same club in 1986 and 1988. If that's the case, then he wouldn't have played for two different clubs, making the comparison irrelevant.\n\nBut considering the table, each competition seems distinct, so if Adnan played in both, their durations would vary based on the number of matches each had during his time there.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, I think the best answer is that the claim is false because the 1986 Gulf Cup had multiple matches, while the 1988 Gulf Cup only had one, implying different playing times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Adnan Al Talyani played for equal durations in both the 1986 and 1988 Gulf Clubs. However, upon analyzing the provided table:\n\n1. **1986 Gulf Club**: There are three matches listed (24 March, 2 April, and 7 April).\n2. **1988 Gulf Club**: Only one match is recorded on 17 March.\n\nSince the number of matches differs significantly between the two years, it's reasonable to infer that Adnan's playing time would also differ. Therefore, the claim does not hold true based on the available data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because the 1986 Gulf Club had multiple matches while the 1988 Gulf Club only had one, implying different durations of play for Adnan Al Talyani.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"adnan al talyani never have the same score 2 time.\" Hmm, I think that means Adnan Al Talyani never had the same score on two different occasions, right? So I need to check each match he played in and see if any of his scores are the same as another game's.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table row by row. The columns we care about here are 'date', 'venue', 'score', 'result', and 'competition'. But since the claim is specifically about Adnan Al Talyani's scores being the same in two different matches, the key columns would be 'score' for him.\n\nWait, but how do I know which rows pertain to Adnan Al Talyani? The 'competition' column might give a clue. For example, looking at the competition column, there are mentions of Gulf Cup, Asian Cup, World Cup qualification, and a Confederations Cup. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 10 March 1984: venue is Royal Oman Police Stadium, Muscat; score is 1-0. Competition is 1984 Gulf Cup. I don't think Adnan Al Talyani was involved here, but I'm not sure. Maybe he's playing for Oman.\n\n2. 12 March 1984: same venue and competition. Score is 1-0 as well. If it's the same team, maybe same players, so score could be similar, but that doesn't necessarily mean Adnan was involved.\n\n3. 4 December 1984: National Stadium in Singapore; score 1-0; Asian Cup. Maybe not him.\n\n4. 20 Sept 1985: Al Rashid Stadium, Dubai; scores 1-1 and 2-3. These are different, so even if it's the same player, the same score doesn't happen here.\n\n5. 27 Sept 1985: King Fahd Stadium, Taif; score 2-0. Different from others. If Adnan was playing, does he have another game with 2-0? I need to check further.\n\n6. 24 March 1986: Bahrain National Stadium; score 2-2. Not repeated in his matches as per the table.\n\n7. 2 April 1986: same venue and competition; score 2-0. So here, if Adnan played in both 24 March and 2 April, that would be two different games with scores of 2-2 and 2-0. Wait, no, 24 March was 2-2, then 2 April is 2-0. Different scores.\n\n8. 7 April 1986: same venue; score 2-3. So Adnan would have three different scores in Gulf Cup: 1-0 (maybe not), 2-0, 2-3. Wait, but earlier I'm not sure if it's him.\n\n9. 17 March 1988: King Fahd International Stadium, Riyadh; score 1-0. If that's Adnan, then he has another game with the same score elsewhere? Let me see.\n\n10. 10 Feb 1989: Islamabad; score 3-0. World Cup qualification. Maybe not him.\n\n11. 17 Oct 1989: National Stadium, Singapore; score 2-1. Different from others.\n\n12. 28 Oct 1989: Darul Makmur Stadium, Kuantan; score 1-1. So if Adnan was here, he had a game with 1-1 and another with same? Let's see.\n\n13. 3 Nov 1994: Zayed Sports City Stadium, Abu Dhabi; score 1-0.\n\n14. 9 Nov 1994: Same venue; score 2-0. So if Adnan played both 1-0 and 2-0, that would be two different same scores.\n\nWait, in this row (row index 13) it's 1-0, and row 14 is 2-0. If both are Adnan, then he has two different games with the same score? Or does \"same score\" mean exact same number, like if he scored 2 goals twice?\n\nWait, no. The claim is \"Adnan Al Talyani never have the same score 2 time.\" So he didn't have two matches where his team's score was the same as another match. For example, if he had a game where his team scored 2-0 and another game where they scored 2-0, that would be two times with the same score.\n\nLooking at the table, row index 14 is 2-0, and in row 7 it's also 2-0. If Adnan was involved in both, then he has two games with 2-0. Alternatively, row 9 is 3-0, which is unique, so no.\n\nWait, the 2-0 appears twice: once on 27 Sept 1985 and again on 9 Nov 1994. If Adnan was part of both, then he had two different games with the same score (2-0). So that would mean the claim is false because he did have the same score twice.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the same game, but I think each row represents a different match.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the 'result' is different. For example, 1-0 result versus 2-0. But the claim is about the same score, so perhaps in two different games, his team scored the same number of goals, regardless of the opponent's score.\n\nSo if Adnan played two matches where his team scored 2-0, that would be two times with the same score (2 for his team). So in row 7, 2-0; row 14, 2-0. If both are Adnan, then yes, he had two games with same score.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about total goals or something else, but I think it's per game.\n\nSo looking at the table, the scores for each competition:\n\nGulf Cup: \n\n- 1-0 (row 0? Not sure), 1-0 (row 1?), 2-0 (row7), 2-3 (row8)\n\nAsian Cup: 1-0 (row2?), 1-0 (row3?), maybe not Adnan.\n\nWorld Cup qualification:\n\n- 3-0 (row9), 2-1 (row10), 2-1 (row11), 1-1 (row12), 1-0 (row13), 2-0 (row14)\n\nWait, so in World Cup qualification, row9 is 3-0; row14 is 2-0. So if Adnan played both, then he has two different games with different scores.\n\nBut the claim is that he never had the same score twice. So if he didn't have any two matches where his team scored the same number of goals, then the claim would be true.\n\nLooking through all his matches in the table:\n\nHe has 1-0 (maybe row13?), 2-0 (row14), 3-0 (row9), 2-1 (row11), etc. So no repeats of the same score across different games.\n\nWait, but in Gulf Cup, he had 2-0 and maybe another 2-0? Or not?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the Asian Cup or other competitions, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all Adnan Al Talyani's matches:\n\nLooking at each row, if it's World Cup qualification, maybe he was involved. Let's assume rows 9-14 are his.\n\nRow9: 3-0\n\nRow10: 2-1 (but that might be the opponent)\n\nWait, no, in row9, his team scored 3 goals; row14, they scored 2 goals.\n\nSo if Adnan was involved in both, he had different scores. So he didn't have two games with same score.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Gulf Cup, rows7 and8: 2-0 and 2-3. If he played both, then he had a 2-0 game and another game where his team scored less (2-3), so no same score twice.\n\nTherefore, maybe the claim is true because Adnan never had two games with the exact same score for his team.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if all these matches are indeed his. Maybe I should look up more info, but since I can't access external data, I have to go by the table given.\n\nIn conclusion, from the table provided, Adnan Al Talyani's scores in different games don't repeat. He has 3-0, 2-1, 2-0, etc., each appearing once. So the claim that he never had the same score twice is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Adnan Al Talyani never have the same score 2 time\" can be analyzed by examining his scores across different matches. After reviewing the table, it's evident that Adnan's team scored various goal totals in each game without any repetition. Therefore, he did not have two matches with the same score.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is true because Adnan Al Talyani did not have two games with the same score for his team.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Adnan Al Talyani playing at the 1984 Gulf Cup half the amount of time compared to the 1984 Asian Cup is true or false. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any matches involving Adnan Al Talyani in the given table. The table lists various competitions with their dates, venues, scores, results, and the competition names.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **1984 Gulf Cup**: There are two matches on March 10 and March 12, 1984, both at the Royal Oman Police Stadium in Muscat. The scores are 1-0 and 1-0 respectively. I don't see Adnan Al Talyani's name here, but maybe he played.\n  \n- **1984 Asian Cup**: There's a match on December 4, 1984, at the National Stadium in Singapore with a score of 1-0. Again, no mention of Adnan Al Talyani, but perhaps he was part of the team.\n\nSince there are only two matches for each competition, I need to figure out how much time Adnan spent in each. If both competitions had two matches each and assuming he played in all his team's matches, then he would have played twice in the Gulf Cup and twice in the Asian Cup. That means he spent the same amount of time in each, not half.\n\nSo the claim that he played at the 1984 Gulf Club half the time compared to the 1984 Asian Cup is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"Adnan Al Talyani played at the 1986 Gulf Cup only on April 7, 1986.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking for Adnan Al Talyani in the table. Scanning through each row's 'venue' and 'result' might help, but perhaps it's better to look directly for his name in the table. Hmm, looking at the table, I don't see a direct mention of Adnan Al Talyani. The table has various players or teams, but his name isn't there. Maybe he's an assistant coach or part of the support staff? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to him playing in the 1986 Gulf Cup on April 7th. So I should look for entries related to the 1986 Gulf Cup. Let me check the 'competition' column for that year. Yes, there are two entries under the 1986 Gulf Cup: one on March 24 and another on April 2 and April 7.\n\nLooking at the April 7, 1986 entry, the venue is Bahrain National Stadium in Manama. The score was 2-0, and the result was a win. So that's one match where he might have played.\n\nBut the claim says he only played on April 7. Are there any other matches for Adnan Al Talyani in the 1986 Gulf Cup? Checking through all the rows, I don't see another entry with his name or related to him specifically. Maybe he was only involved in that one match on April 7.\n\nHowever, since the table doesn't list Adnan Al Talyani's participation directly, it's unclear if he actually played that game. The claim is about his participation, but without explicit data about his role in any matches, I can't confirm he played only on April 7, especially since there might be other games related to the Gulf Cup where he was involved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps \"Adnan Al Talyani\" refers to a team, not a player? Or maybe it's a typo for another name. Alternatively, perhaps he's mentioned in the 'result' or 'score' columns indirectly, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the table lists only his matches. If I see other entries where he played, that could affect the claim. But looking through all the rows, there are no mentions of Adnan Al Talyani anywhere else except possibly in the 1986 Gulf Cup on April 7. So if that's the only match he played in the Gulf Cup for that year, then perhaps the claim is true.\n\nBut without explicit evidence of his participation elsewhere, it's hard to say definitively. However, based on the information given, there's only one relevant entry for the 1986 Gulf Cup on April 7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
