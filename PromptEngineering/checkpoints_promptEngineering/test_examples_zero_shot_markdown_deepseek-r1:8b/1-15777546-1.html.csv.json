The task is to determine whether the claim \"episode number 10 be entitle reflection\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that episode number 10 is titled \"Reflection.\" So, I should look for an episode with the number 10 and see if its title matches this.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original airdate, and tv broadcast. The relevant columns for checking the claim are \"title\" because that's what the claim refers to.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to episode number 10. Since each row starts with \"no in series,\" I can look through the table for where \"no in series\" is 10. \n\nScanning down, I see:\n- Row 0: no in series 27\n- ...\n- Wait, actually, looking at the table again, it seems that the first column is labeled \"no in series,\" and the second column is \"no in season.\" Each row represents a different episode with unique \"no in series\" numbers. So I need to find the row where \"no in series\" is 10.\n\nWait, upon reviewing, I realize that each row starts from no in series 27 up to 51, but looking for the specific number 10 might not be present because all the \"no in series\" numbers start at 27. That's confusing because if the table only goes from 27 onwards, then episode number 10 isn't in this list.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"no in series\" is a numbering within the season. For example, s02e01 would be episode 1 of Season 2. So \"no in series\" might refer to the order within the series, not necessarily an absolute number. Alternatively, it could be that each season has its own count.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, the first column is labeled \"no in series,\" which probably refers to the episode number within the series, not a specific season. So if the claim is about episode number 10 being titled \"Reflection,\" I need to find row where the title is \"Reflection\" and see what its no in series is.\n\nLooking through the table for the title \"Reflection,\" I find it in row 6 (since each row increments by 1, but let me count properly). Wait, looking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Turtles in Space, Part 1\nRow 1: Turtles in Space, Part 3\nRow 2: Turtles in Space, Part 4\nRow 3: Turtles in Space, Part 5\nRow 4: Secret Origins, Part 1\nRow 5: Secret Origins, Part 2\nRow 6: Secret Origins, Part 3\nRow 7: The Ultimate Ninja\nRow 8: Reflections (this is row 9)\nWait, let me count:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- Line 27: Turtles in Space, Part 1 (row 0)\n- ...\n- Line 30: Turtles in Space, Part 4 (row 2)\n- Then Secret Origins parts 1-3 (rows 4-6)\n- The Ultimate Ninja is row 7\n- Reflections is row 8 (since line 36 is reflections, which would be row index 8)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list out the rows with their no in series:\n\nRow 0: 27\nRow 1:29\nRow2:30\nRow3:31\nRow4:32\nRow5:33\nRow6:34\nRow7:35\nRow8:36\nRow9:37\nRow10:38\nRow11:39\nRow12:40\nRow13:41\nRow14:42\nRow15:43\nRow16:44\nRow17:45\nRow18:46\nRow19:47\nRow20:48\nRow21:49\nRow22:50\nRow23:51\n\nWait, actually, each row's no in series increases by 1 from the previous. So if I'm looking for \"Reflection,\" which is line 36, that would be row index 8.\n\nBut wait, let me check the table again. The first row (row 0) has no in series 27 and title Turtles in Space, Part 1. Then the next rows go up to 51. So Reflections is at no in series 36, which is row 8.\n\nSo the claim says episode number 10 is titled \"Reflection.\" But according to the table, no in series 36 corresponds to Reflections. However, since the table starts with no in series 27, there's no row for no in series 10. That suggests that episode number 10 doesn't exist in this table.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the \"no in series\" numbering works. Maybe it's per season. For example, each season might have its own \"no in series\" count. But looking at the tv broadcast column, I see s02e01, which would be episode 1 of Season 2. So perhaps \"no in series\" refers to the overall series number, not within a specific season.\n\nIn that case, if the table starts with no in series 27, then there is no episode with no in series 10. Therefore, the claim that episode number 10 is titled Reflection would be false because such an episode doesn't exist in this dataset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"no in series\" numbers are per season, and Season 2's episodes start at no in series 27. So if someone refers to episode number 10 within Season 2, that would correspond to no in series 27 + (10-1) = 36. So Reflections is s02e10, which is row 8.\n\nBut the claim says \"episode number 10 be entitle reflection.\" If it's referring to the overall series number, then episode 10 doesn't exist here because the first episode in the table is no in series 27. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe table starts with \"no in series\" at 27 and goes up to 51. There's no row for \"no in series\" 10, so episode 10 isn't present. The title \"Reflections\" is at no in series 36 (row 8), which would be episode 10 of Season 2 if counting from 27. Since the claim refers to episode number 10, it's incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
