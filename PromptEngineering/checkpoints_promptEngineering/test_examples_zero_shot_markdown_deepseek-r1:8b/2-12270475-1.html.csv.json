    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's start by carefully reading both the table and the claim.\n\nThe table has several columns: state, preliminaries, interview, swimsuit, evening gown, and average. Each row represents a different state with corresponding scores under these categories.\n\nThe claim says, \"the north carolina contest have a preliminaries score of a 8.068 with an even gown score of 8.472.\" So, I need to verify two things: the preliminaries score for North Carolina is 8.068 and the evening gown score is 8.472.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for \"north carolina\" in the state column. Once found, I check each relevant cell.\n\nFirst, under \"preliminaries,\" it's 8.068. That matches. Next, under \"evening gown,\" it's listed as 8.472. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nI should identify which row and columns to include in the relevant cells. The state is at row index 8 (since the first row is Washington at index 0). The two columns are \"preliminaries\" and \"evening gown.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be row 8 for both columns. That makes sense because they directly support the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if North Carolina's preliminaries score is 8.068 and evening gown score is 8.472.\n\nThe table confirms these values in their respective columns. The relevant cells are identified by their row index (8) and column names (\"preliminaries\" and \"evening gown\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
