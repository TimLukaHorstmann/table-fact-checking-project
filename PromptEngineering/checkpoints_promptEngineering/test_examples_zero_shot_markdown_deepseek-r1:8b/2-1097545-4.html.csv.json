    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"europe have cd format on october 11 , 2004\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions that Europe has a CD format on October 11, 2004. So, I should look for entries in the table related to Europe, that specific date, and the CD format.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's organized with several columns: region, date, label, format, and catalog. Each row represents different data points.\n\nFirst, I'll filter the table to find rows where the region is \"Europe\" and the date is October 11, 2004. \n\nFrom the table:\n- The first two rows are for Europe on October 11, 2004.\n    - First row: format is CD.\n    - Second row: format is CD / DVD.\n\nSo, there's at least one entry that matches the region and date with a CD format. That would seem to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure if \"Europe\" refers to all European countries or specific ones. The term \"Europe\" in data could sometimes be a regional designation, but in this context, it's probably just representing one country named Europe. But regardless, the table lists \"europe\" (lowercase) as a region, and that's how I should match.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify whether it's CD or CD/DVD, so having at least one CD format on that date supports the claim. The second row also has CD / DVD, which is a superset of CD, but since the claim specifically mentions CD, only the first row fully matches both region and date with CD.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the ones where region is Europe, date is October 11, 2004, and format is CD. That's the first row in the table, which has all those attributes.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on the first relevant cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the existence of a CD format entry for Europe on October 11, 2004.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the date for the disk from europe be october 11 , 2004.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what parts of the table are relevant here. The table has several columns: region, date, label, format, and catalog. So, when looking at the claim, I'm focusing on the 'date' and 'region' parts.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the disk from europe,\" so I should look for rows where the region is Europe. Scanning through the table, I see that the first two rows are for Europe with dates October 11, 2004. The next few regions are the United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea, and Japan, but those aren't relevant here because the claim specifies Europe.\n\nNow, looking at the date in the claim: October 11, 2004. I check the table to see if there's a matching date for Europe. Yes, both entries for Europe have that exact date\u2014October 11, 2004. The format column shows whether it's just CD or CD/DVD, but the claim doesn't specify the format, so that part isn't necessary for verifying the date.\n\nSo, focusing on region and date, all Europe rows with October 11, 2004 are relevant. Therefore, the cells to check are the two rows where region is Europe and the date matches.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the date for a cd from europe be before october 11 , 2004\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's specifically about CDs from Europe and their release dates. The claim wants to know if all European CD releases were before October 11, 2004.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various regions like Europe, United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea, and Japan. Each row has details such as date, label, format, and catalog numbers. My focus should be on the rows where the region is Europe because the claim is about European CDs.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table to find those that pertain to Europe:\n\n1. First row: Region is Europe, date is October 11, 2004, label is Sony BMG, Columbia, format is CD.\n2. Second row: Also Europe, same date as above, label same, format is CD/DVD.\n\nSo there are two rows for Europe with the date on October 11, 2004. Now, the claim says that these CDs should be before October 11, but the dates in the table match exactly on that day. \n\nWait, the claim uses \"before\" which implies strictly earlier than the given date. If a CD is released on the same day mentioned in the claim, does that count as being before? Or does \"before\" mean strictly prior to that date?\n\nIn many contexts, \"on\" or \"by\" would include the given date, but \"before\" usually means before. So if the CD was released on October 11, it's not technically before that date.\n\nBut I should check the exact wording of the claim: \"the date for a cd from europe be before october 11 , 2004\". If a CD is labeled as having been released on October 11, then it's not before that date. So does that mean the claim is false?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the format matters. The first Europe row has format \"cd\" and the second has \"cd / dvd\". But regardless of format, the date is the same.\n\nSo, both European CDs are released on October 11, which is not before that date. Therefore, the claim's assertion that all European CDs were released before this date would be false because at least one was released on that exact date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is checking for any European CD being before that date, but since some are on that date, perhaps it's still considered as \"before\" including the same day. But in English, \"before\" usually doesn't include the given date. For example, if I say I'll arrive before tomorrow, today counts as arriving on time, not before.\n\nSo, the claim says all European CDs were released before October 11, but there are entries on that exact date. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not entirely accurate\u2014some European CDs were released on that day, not strictly before.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for the claim \"the date for a cd from europe be before october 11 , 2004\" are the two European CD entries with the date October 11, 2004. Since these CDs were released on the specified date, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this decision.\n\nThe claim states: \"catalog number 5187487 be released in the united state, canada and australia in cd / dvd format.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for rows where the catalog number is \"5187487\" because that's specifically mentioned in the claim. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first row with \"5187487\" is under the 'catalog' column for Europe on October 11, 2004, but it doesn't specify the region as USA, Canada, or Australia.\n- Next, another row has \"5187487\" under catalog for Canada and Australia. But again, the regions are Canada and Australia, not United States.\n\nWait, there's also a row for the United States with catalog number 5187482, but that's a different number. So the claim mentions 5187487, which is associated with Canada and Australia, not the USA.\n\nLooking at the format, in both Canada and Australia entries, the format is \"cd / dvd\". Now, checking if the regions mentioned in these rows match the claim:\n\nCanada: Catalog number 5187487, cd/dvd format. So this matches Canada.\nAustralia: Catalog number 5187487, same format. This also matches Australia.\n\nBut the claim says it's released in the United States as well. However, looking at the table, I don't see any row for the USA with catalog number 5187487. Instead, the USA has catalog numbers 5187482 and 5187487, but 5187482 is associated with epic while 5187487 is under sony bmg, columbia.\n\nWait, actually, the USA's first entry (row index 2) for catalog 5187482 is labeled as 'epic' in format CD, and another for cd/dvd. But neither of these are 5187487.\n\nSo the claim states that 5187487 was released in three regions: USA, Canada, Australia. However, according to the table:\n\n- 5187487 is present in Canada (rows 4 and 5) with formats CD/DVD.\n- It's also present in Australia (rows 6 and 7) with same format.\n- But there's no entry for the USA with catalog number 5187487. Instead, USA has 5187482.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect regarding the USA region. Since the USA isn't listed as a region where 5187487 was released in CD/DVD format, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells: I need to find all rows where catalog number is 5187487 and regions are Canada or Australia because those match part of the claim but not the USA. So:\n\n- Canada: row index 4 (columns date, label, etc.) specifically column 'catalog' at row 4.\n- Australia: row index 6, same.\n\nBut since the claim mentions the USA as a region, and there's no such entry in the table for 5187487 in the USA, those cells are relevant because they show that 5187487 was released in Canada and Australia but not in the USA. Therefore, these cells contradict the claim about the USA part.\n\nWait, maybe I should only include the cells that support the claim's true parts. The claim says it's released in USA, Canada, and Australia for 5187487. But since USA isn't there, those two rows (Canada and Australia) support the format but not the region entirely. However, since the claim is incorrect about the USA, maybe all cells with 5187487 should be considered relevant because they show where it was released, which doesn't include the USA as per the table.\n\nI think the relevant cells are those that have catalog number 5187487 in Canada and Australia because those are the regions mentioned after catalog number, but excluding the USA since there's no such entry. Alternatively, maybe all rows with 5187487 should be included as they show where it was released, which doesn't include USA.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about whether 5187487 was released in those three regions. From the table:\n\n- Canada: yes\n- Australia: yes\n- USA: no\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the ones that show where it was actually released (Canada and Australia), but not the USA. So including their rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all cells with 5187487 should be included because they're the only evidence for that number, regardless of region.\n\nI think I should include all cells where catalog is 5187487 because those are the ones we need to verify whether the claim is true or false. The claim says it was released in USA, Canada, Australia with format cd/dvd. From the table:\n\n- Canada: yes, format cd/dvd\n- Australia: yes, same format\n- USA: no catalog 5187487 entry.\n\nTherefore, including all rows where catalog is 5187487 and their regions are Canada, Australia, and Europe (but Europe's catalog is different). Wait, in the table:\n\n- Europe has two entries with catalog numbers starting with 51874, but not 5187487. The first row for Europe has col 5187489, second has col 5187487. So wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 0: Europe, catalog 5187489\nRow1: Europe, catalog 5187487\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the markdown:\n\n| region        | date               | label                   | format   | catalog      |\n|:--------------|:-------------------|:------------------------|:---------|:-------------|\n| europe        | october 11 , 2004  | sony bmg , columbia     | cd       | col 518748 9 |\n| europe        | october 11 , 2004  | sony bmg , columbia     | cd / dvd | col 518748 7 |\n\nAh, so the catalog numbers are \"col 5187489\" and \"col 5187487\". So in Europe, it's two different catalogs. So 5187487 is present in Europe as well.\n\nBut in the claim, it's about 5187487 being released in USA, Canada, Australia. The table shows 5187487 in Canada (rows 4,5), Australia (6,7), and Europe (row1). But not in USA.\n\nSo to verify the claim:\n\nCatalog number 5187487 is present in:\n\n- Europe\n- Canada\n- Australia\n\nNot in USA.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are the ones showing where 5187487 was released. So all rows where catalog is 5187487, which are:\n\n1. Europe row (row index 1)\n2. Canada rows (4 and5)\n3. Australia rows (6 and7)\n\nBut since the claim mentions USA, Canada, and Australia, only Canada and Australia entries for 5187487 support the regions mentioned in the claim. The Europe entry is extra but still relevant because it shows 5187487 was also released there.\n\nTherefore, I think all cells where catalog is 5187487 should be included as they are all relevant to verifying whether 5187487 was released in certain regions. So including row1 (Europe), rows4-5 (Canada), rows6-7 (Australia).\n\nBut since the claim only mentions USA, Canada, and Australia, but not Europe, perhaps only the Canada and Australia entries for 5187487 are relevant to the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all cells should be included because they show where 5187487 was released, which includes more regions than just the ones mentioned in the claim.\n\nBut I think the main point is that since the claim says it's released in USA, Canada, and Australia for 5187487, but according to the table, it wasn't released in USA, only Canada and Australia. Therefore, the relevant cells are those showing that it was released in Canada and Australia (for catalog 5187487) and not in USA.\n\nSo perhaps I should include all rows with catalog 5187487 because they're the ones we need to verify whether 5187487 was released there.\n\nBut for the purpose of this task, I think including all cells where catalog is 5187487 regardless of region would be appropriate because that's the number in question. However, since the claim specifically mentions USA, Canada, and Australia, perhaps only those regions should be considered relevant.\n\nWait, maybe not. The user wants to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the database (the table). So the task is to check for catalog 5187487 and see where it was released. Therefore, all cells with that catalog number are relevant because they show in which regions it was released.\n\nThus, including rows1,4,5,6,7 as they have catalog 5187487.\n\nBut perhaps the date and label info isn't necessary; only the region and catalog number.\n\nSo to make it clear:\n\nRelevant cells are all where catalog is 5187487, which are row1 (Europe), row4 (Canada), row5 (Canada), row6 (Australia), row7 (Australia).\n\nTherefore, these cells show that 5187487 was released in Europe, Canada, and Australia.\n\nSince the claim says it was released in USA, Canada, and Australia, but not mentioning Europe, the inclusion of Europe is irrelevant to the claim's correctness regarding USA. However, since the table shows it wasn't released in USA, only including the cells for Canada and Australia would directly contradict the claim.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me rephrase: The user wants to verify whether the statement about 5187487 being released in USA, Canada, and Australia is true based on the table. So to do that, we need to check if there are entries for 5187487 in those regions.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For USA (region 'usa'), is there a row with catalog=5187487? No.\n- For Canada: yes\n- For Australia: yes\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect about USA. So the relevant cells would be those that show where it was released (Canada and Australia) but not USA.\n\nBut the task is to find all cells that are relevant for verifying the claim's truthfulness. Therefore, including any cell that could potentially support or contradict the claim.\n\nSince 5187487 is present in Canada and Australia, those cells would show that part of the claim is true (release in Canada and Australia), but since USA doesn't have it, those would be used to find the claim false.\n\nTherefore, all cells with catalog=5187487 are relevant because they directly relate to whether the number was released in specific regions.\n\nThus, including:\n\n- Row1: Europe\n- Rows4-5: Canada\n- Rows6-7: Australia\n\nThese are the cells where 5187487 is present, showing it was released in those regions. Since the claim only mentions USA, Canada, and Australia, but not Europe, the presence of Europe doesn't affect the claim's truthfulness regarding the mentioned regions.\n\nTherefore, I think including all these cells is appropriate to show where 5187487 was released.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the statement about the release of catalog number 5187487 in the USA, Canada, and Australia is accurate, we need to examine the relevant entries in the provided table. \n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Catalog Number 5187487:**\n   - **Canada:** Released in rows 4 and 5.\n   - **Australia:** Released in rows 6 and 7.\n   - **Europe:** Released in row 1, though not mentioned in the statement.\n\n2. **USA:** There is no entry for catalog number 5187487 in the USA region according to the table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe statement is incorrect regarding the release in the USA since there is no corresponding entry for catalog number 5187487 in that region. However, the presence of entries in Canada and Australia supports that part of the claim.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 1 (Europe)\n- Rows 4 and 5 (Canada)\n- Rows 6 and 7 (Australia)\n\nThese cells provide evidence about where catalog number 5187487 was released, which includes regions not mentioned in the original statement (Europe) as well as confirming release in Canada and Australia.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe relevant entries for catalog number 5187487 are located in rows 1, 4-5, and 6-7 of the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is that \"5187487 be the catalog number with the date november 18 , 2004.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's asserting that on November 18, 2004, there was a catalog number 5187487 released. So I need to look through the table for any row where the catalog number is 5187487 and the date is November 18, 2004.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the following columns: region, date, label, format, and catalog. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. The first row: europe, October 11, 2004, Sony BMG, Columbia, col 518748 9. Catalog number here is \"col 518748 9\", which doesn't match 5187487.\n\n2. Second row: Same date as above but format is CD/DVD and catalog is col 518748 7. Still not matching 5187487.\n\n3. Third row: united states, October 12, 2004, Epic, cd, catalog 5187482. Not our number.\n\n4. Fourth row: same date and label as above but with format CD/DVD and same catalog 5187487? Wait, no, the catalog here is 5187487. So this row has catalog number 5187487 on October 12, 2004.\n\nBut wait, the claim says November 18, 2004. This row's date is October 12, so it's not relevant.\n\n5. Fifth row: canada, same dates as above (October 12), same labels, catalog 5187482 and 5187487 on CD/DVD format. So again, no match for November 18.\n\n6. Sixth row: australia, same date and catalog numbers but different label (Sony BMG, Epic). Catalog is 5187482 and 5187487. Dates are October 15, which don't match the claim's November 18.\n\n7. Seventh row: south korea, November 16, 2004. The catalog number here is cpk - 3337, which doesn't match 5187487.\n\n8. Eighth row: japan, December 22, 2004. Catalog number is 5187482. Not the one we're looking for.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me double-check each row's date and catalog:\n\nLooking specifically for November 18, 2004. Scanning through the table, none of the dates match November 18. The closest are November 16 (south korea) and December 22 (japan). So there is no entry with date November 18.\n\nAdditionally, looking for any row where the catalog number is 5187487: in row 4, it's 5187487 but on October 12. In row 2, it's \"col 518748 7\", which might be a typo or formatting issue, but not exactly 5187487.\n\nSo, there's no row that has both the catalog number 5187487 and the date November 18, 2004. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that \"5187487\" is the catalog number released on November 18, 2004. Checking the table:\n\n- The only entries with \"5187487\" are on October 12 and October 11, 2004, not November 18.\n- There's no entry for November 18, 2004.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"catalog number 5186482 represent a sony music japan , epic product.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table column by column to see where the catalog number 5186482 appears and what information it's associated with.\n\nLooking at the 'catalog' column in the table, the relevant entries are:\n- col 5187482\n- 5187482\n- 5187487\n- cpk - 3337\n- 5187482 (again)\n- 5187487 (again)\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"5186482,\" which isn't exactly matching any of these. The closest is \"5187482.\" So maybe there's a typo or I'm missing something.\n\nNow, let me check each row where 'catalog' is either 5187482 or similar.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Region: europe\n- Date: October 11, 2004\n- Label: Sony BMG, Columbia\n- Format: CD and CD/DVD\n- Catalog: col 518748 9\n\nThis doesn't match because the catalog number here is \"col 518748 9\" and not just a simple number like 5186482.\n\nNext, the fourth row:\n- Region: canada\n- Date: October 12, 2004\n- Label: Sony BMG, Columbia\n- Format: CD/DVD\n- Catalog: 5187487\n\nAgain, not matching.\n\nLooking at the seventh row (index 6?

None of these entries have that exact number. The closest is 5187482, but it's a different number. Therefore, the catalog number 5186482 isn't present in any row of the table.\n\nNow, checking if any row has both \"Sony Music Japan\" as the label and catalog number 5186482.\n\nLooking through the 'label' column:\n\n- Europe: Sony BMG, Columbia\n- United States: Epic\n- Canada: Sony BMG, Columbia\n- Australia: Sony BMG, Epic\n- South Korea: Sony BMG, Columbia\n- Japan: Sony Music Japan, Epic\n\nIn row 8 (Japan), the label is \"Sony Music Japan, Epic\" and catalog is 5187482. But the claim is about 5186482, which doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other rows have the correct catalog number and relevant labels. For example, in row 8, it's Sony Music Japan, but the catalog number is 5187482, not 5186482.\n\nSo, since there's no entry with catalog number 5186482, the claim doesn't hold true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a non-existent catalog number (5186482) in the table. After reviewing all entries, none match this number.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"catalog number 5286482 represent an epic product\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look for rows where the catalog number matches 5286482. Scanning down the table, I see that in row 3 (index 3), the catalog number is 5187482, and again in row 5 (index 5) it's 5187487. Wait, but none of them have 5286482. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check.\n\nWait, looking back at the table provided: The last row for japan has a catalog number of 5187482. Let me confirm that again. The japan entry is:\n\n| japan         | december 22 , 2004 | sony music japan , epic | cd       | 5187482      |\n\nYes, it's 5187482, not 5286482. So the claim says 5286482, which isn't present in the table at all.\n\nWait, did I misread? Let me check each row again:\n\n- Row 0: col 5187489\n- Row 1: col 5187487\n- Row 2: 5187482\n- Row 3: 5187487\n- Row 4: 3337 (cpk)\n- Row 5: 5187482\n- Row 6: 5187487\n- Row 7: cpk - 3337\n- Row 8: 5187482\n\nSo no row has catalog number 5286482. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no such catalog number in the table.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim mentions a specific catalog number, so I should check every cell in the 'catalog' column for that exact value.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: col 5187489 \u2013 not matching.\n2. Row 1: col 5187487 \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: 5187482 \u2013 nope.\n4. Row 3: 5187487 \u2013 no.\n5. Row 4: cpk - 3337 \u2013 nope.\n6. Row 5: 5187482 \u2013 no.\n7. Row 6: 5187487 \u2013 no.\n8. Row 7: cpk - 3337 \u2013 no.\n9. Row 8: 5187482 \u2013 no.\n\nNone match 5286482, so the relevant cells are all the 'catalog' column entries because none of them have 5286482. Wait, but actually, since none match, maybe I don't need to include any. But according to instructions, I should list the cells that are relevant for verification, which in this case, since the claim's catalog number isn't present, perhaps all 'catalog' column cells are irrelevant because they don't contain 5286482. Or maybe it's better to say none are relevant.\n\nWait, but the instruction says: If fully supported, answer \"TRUE\"; otherwise, answer \"FALSE\". So I think the correct approach is that since there's no row with catalog number 5286482 in the table, the claim is false.\n\nNow, for the relevant_cells. Since the claim refers to a specific catalog number, the 'catalog' column is relevant. So all cells in 'catalog' should be considered because each could potentially have that number. But since none do, but according to instructions, I need to list which cells are relevant regardless of their content.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the 'catalog' cells as they contain the possible catalog numbers, and thus checking them is necessary for verifying the claim. So in this case, each row's 'catalog' cell is relevant because that's where the catalog number is listed.\n\nSo, I should go through each row and note their 'catalog' value, but only if it's 5286482. But since none are, maybe it's just that all 'catalog' cells are considered relevant for checking whether the claim's number exists.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include every cell in the 'catalog' column because those are where the catalog numbers are listed, and thus they need to be checked against the claimed number (5286482).\n\nBut wait, perhaps more accurately, since the claim refers to a specific catalog number, I should only consider cells where the value might match. So if 5286482 isn't present in any of them, then it's false.\n\nSo, in conclusion, because there is no row with catalog number 5286482, the claim is FALSE. And all 'catalog' column cells are relevant because that's where the numbers are listed, so checking each to see if any match is necessary.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"catalog number 5286482 represent an epic product\" is **FALSE** because there is no entry in the table with catalog number 5286482. All entries in the 'catalog' column were checked, and none match this number.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
