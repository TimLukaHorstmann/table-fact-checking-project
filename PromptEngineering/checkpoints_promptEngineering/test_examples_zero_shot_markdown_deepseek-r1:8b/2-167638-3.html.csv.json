    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"france be the first country to open a carrefour store\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column in the table represents. The columns are: country, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. So, \"first store\" likely refers to the year when Carrefour opened its first store in that country. My task is to check if France was indeed the first country to have a Carrefour store.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a country, and the numbers under \"first store\" indicate the year they opened their first Carrefour store. For example, Albania's first store was in 2011, Belgium in 2000, and so on.\n\nSo, I need to check France's value in the \"first store\" column. According to the table, France has a value of 1960 under \"first store.\" Now, I should verify if any other country opened their first Carrefour store after 1960 or before that would affect France being the first.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Albania: 2011\n- Belgium: 2000\n- Bulgaria: 2009\n- Cyprus: 2006\n- France: 1960\n- Georgia: 2012\n- Greece: 1991\n- Italy: 1993\n- Macedonia: 2012\n- Monaco: Missing data\n- Poland: 1997\n- Portugal: 1991\n- Romania: 2001\n- Spain: 1973\n- Slovakia: 1998\n- Slovenia: 1998\n- Turkey: 1993\n- United Kingdom: 1972\n\nNow, I need to find the country with the earliest \"first store\" year before 1960. Looking through each country:\n\nFrance is at 1960.\n\nNext, Spain opened in 1973, which is later than France. Poland in 1997, Greece and Portugal in 1991, Romania in 2001, etc., all after France's 1960.\n\nLooking at other countries, I see that the United Kingdom has a value of 1972, which is still after France's 1960. So, among all the listed countries, none have a \"first store\" year earlier than 1960 except perhaps Monaco, but Monaco's first store data is missing (denoted by a dash). \n\nWait, Monaco's first store is marked as \"-\", so it doesn't have a Carrefour store, or maybe it's unknown. So, the earliest year among the other countries is France at 1960.\n\nTherefore, France was indeed the first country to open a Carrefour store according to the table.\n\nBut I should double-check if any country has an earlier \"first store\" year than 1960. Looking again:\n\nAll other countries have their first store after 1960 except France and perhaps Monaco, which is missing data. Since Monaco's first store is \"-\", it means either they didn't open one or the data isn't provided. So, assuming that all other countries with available data opened after France, then yes, France is first.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as France has the earliest \"first store\" year of 1960 among all listed countries. No country in the table opened a Carrefour store before France.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"first store\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"spain have the most hard discounter store out of any of the country they operate in\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It says Spain has the most hard discounters compared to other countries they operate in. So, my focus should be on Spain's hard discounters and compare it with other countries' hard discounters.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"hard discounters\" column, I see:\n\n- Albania: -\n- Belgium: -\n- Bulgaria: -\n- Cyprus: -\n- France: 897\n- Georgia: -\n- Greece: 397\n- Italy: -\n- Macedonia: -\n- Monaco: -\n- Poland: -\n- Portugal: 365\n- Romania: -\n- Spain: 2912\n- Slovakia: 0\n- Slovenia: 6\n- Turkey: 519\n- United Kingdom: -\n\nSo, Spain's hard discounters count is 2912. Now I need to check if this is the highest number compared to other countries listed.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nFrance has 897, Greece has 397, Portugal has 365, Turkey has 519, and Spain has 2912.\n\nAll other countries either have '-', '0', or much lower numbers like Slovenia with 6. Among these, Spain's 2912 is clearly the highest. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the table data provided.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for verification. The relevant row is Spain (row index 8) and the column is \"hard discounters\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as Spain has the highest number of hard discounters compared to other countries listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"hard discounters\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the most recent market expansion into by Carrefour be Georgia and Macedonia.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The user is saying that Carrefour has recently expanded into Georgia and Macedonia. So, I need to check if Carrefour has a presence in these two countries.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are country, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters. These likely refer to the types of stores Carrefour operates in each country. The year mentioned might indicate when they started operating there.\n\nI'll start by locating Georgia and Macedonia in the table. \n\nGeorgia is listed with:\n- First store: 2012\n- Hypermarkets: 1\n- Supermarkets: 1\n- Hard discounters: -\n\nMacedonia is listed as:\n- First store: 2012\n- Hypermarkets: 1\n- Supermarkets: -\n- Hard discounters: -\n\nNow, I need to see if these entries support the claim of a recent expansion. The first store year for both Georgia and Macedonia is 2012, which seems relatively recent compared to other countries in the table.\n\nAdditionally, Carrefour has hypermarkets in both countries. In Georgia, there's 1 hypermarket since 2012, and in Macedonia, also 1 hypermarket since 2012. That suggests they started operating there around that time, which aligns with the claim of a recent expansion.\n\nI should check if any other years are more recent than 2012 in the table for these countries. Looking at Georgia's data, the most recent is 2012. Similarly, Macedonia's first store was also in 2012. No later years are listed for either country beyond that.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it appears that Carrefour did expand into Georgia and Macedonia around 2012 with hypermarkets, supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check Georgia and Macedonia's entries in the table.\n\n- **Georgia**: Established in 2012 with 1 hypermarket.\n- **Macedonia**: Established in 2012 with 1 hypermarket.\n\nThese entries indicate a recent expansion by Carrefour into both countries, aligning with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"first store\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"first store\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about France having the most supermarkets and hypermarkets is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim says: \"France have the most supermarket and hypermarket out of all the country they operate in.\" So, I need to check how many supermarkets and hypermarkets France has compared to other countries in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country, and there are columns for first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. For the claim, I'm only concerned with the \"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\" columns because those are what's being compared.\n\nStarting with France: According to the table, France has 1021 supermarkets and 221 hypermarkets. That's a total of 1021 + 221 = 1242 retail places for supermarkets and hypermarkets.\n\nNow, I'll go through each country one by one to see if any have more than France in these two categories.\n\n- Albania: Supermarkets - \"-\", Hypermarkets - \"1\". Total: 0 (since \"-\" likely means none).\n- Belgium: Supermarkets - 370, Hypermarkets - 45. Total: 415.\n- Bulgaria: Supermarkets -3, Hypermarkets -5. Total:8.\n- Cyprus: Supermarkets -8, Hypermarkets -7. Total:15.\n- France: As above, 1242.\n- Georgia: Supermarkets -1, Hypermarkets -1. Total:2.\n- Greece: Supermarkets -210, Hypermarkets -397. Total:607.\n- Italy: Supermarkets -485, Hypermarkets -45. Total:530.\n- Macedonia: Supermarkets \"-\", so none, Hypermarkets \"-\", none. Total:0.\n- Monaco: Supermarkets -1, Hypermarkets \"-\". Total:1.\n- Poland: Supermarkets -277, Hypermarkets -84. Total:361.\n- Portugal: Supermarkets \"-\", none, Hypermarkets -365. Total:365 (but since one is none, maybe 365? Or does \"-\" mean zero?)\n- Romania: Supermarkets -50, Hypermarkets -25. Total:75.\n- Spain: Supermarkets -115, Hypermarkets -2912. Wait, that's a lot. So Spain has 115 +2912=3027 total for supermarkets and hypermarkets.\n- Slovakia: Supermarkets -0, Hypermarkets -4. Total:4.\n- Slovenia: Supermarkets -12, Hypermarkets -6. Total:18.\n- Turkey: Supermarkets -99, Hypermarkets -519. Total:618.\n- United Kingdom: Supermarkets \"-\", none, Hypermarkets \"-\", none. Total:0.\n\nWait a minute, Spain's hypermarket count is 2912, which is way higher than France's 221. So France doesn't have the most in both categories. The claim says \"supermarkets and hypermarkets,\" so I think it refers to having the highest total or maybe the highest in each category. But looking at the numbers, Spain has more hypermarkets than France by a huge margin.\n\nSo the claim is saying France has the most, but actually, Spain has more. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that France has the most supermarkets and hypermarkets, but upon reviewing the table, it's evident that Spain has significantly more hypermarkets (2912) than France (221). This makes the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Carrefour operate the least amount of hypermarket compare to supermarket and hard discounter.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is comparing Carrefour's number of hypermarkets against supermarkets and hard discounters across different countries.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various countries along with numbers for first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. Since the claim specifically mentions \"Carrefour,\" I need to find out which row corresponds to Carrefour. \n\nBut wait, in the table provided, there is no row for Carrefour. All the rows are for specific countries like Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, etc., including France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. So Carrefour isn't listed here.\n\nThis makes me think that either Carrefour isn't present in these countries, or perhaps the data is incomplete. But according to the claim, it's comparing Carrefour's hypermarkets to supermarkets and hard discounters elsewhere. Since there's no data for Carrefour in any of the columns (first store, hypermarkets, etc.), I can't directly compare their numbers.\n\nWithout the relevant data about Carrefour's presence, I can't assess whether they have the least number of hypermarkets compared to others.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions France opening a Carrefour store after Italy. So, I'm looking for information related to when France opened their Carrefour stores and compare that with Italy's timeline.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country, and the columns are first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. Since the claim is about opening a store specifically by France in Carrefour, I should focus on the \"first store\" column for France and Italy.\n\nIn the table:\n- For France, the first store was opened in 1960.\n- For Italy, the first store was opened in 1993.\n\nThe claim says that France opened their store after Italy. Wait, no, actually, France's first store is earlier than Italy's. France's store was in 1960, and Italy's was much later in 1993. So if we consider \"after\" as chronologically after, then France did open its store before Italy.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"france open a carrefour store after italy\". That would mean that France opened their Carrefour store after Italy did. But according to the table, France's first store was in 1960, and Italy's was in 1993. So France actually opened theirs earlier than Italy. Therefore, the claim is false because France didn't open their store after Italy; they opened it before.\n\nI need to check if there are any other relevant cells. The claim mentions Carrefour stores, which might fall under hypermarkets or supermarkets? Wait, no, \"first store\" specifically refers to the initial store opened by each country. So the relevant columns for France and Italy would be their first store years. Therefore, I should include both of those in relevant_cells.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- France's row (index 5) under first store.\n- Italy's row (index 8) under first store.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE because France opened its Carrefour store before Italy did, not after.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that France opened a Carrefour store after Italy. However, according to the table, France's first store was opened in 1960, while Italy's first store was opened much later in 1993.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says, \"Georgia and Macedonia be the first country to open a Carrefour store.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which columns in the table are relevant here. The table has several columns: country, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters. Since the claim is about opening a Carrefour store, the most relevant column would be \"first store\". However, sometimes companies might open different types of stores before their main ones, so I should also consider hypermarkets and supermarkets in case they are part of Carrefour's expansion.\n\nNext, I need to look at Georgia and Macedonia. Let me find their rows in the table.\n\nGeorgia is listed with:\n- country: georgia\n- first store: 2012\n- hypermarkets: 1\n- supermarkets: 1\n\nMacedonia has:\n- country: macedonia\n- first store: 2012\n- hypermarkets: 1\n- supermarkets: -\n\nSo, according to the table, both Georgia and Macedonia have a \"first store\" year of 2012. \n\nI should also check if they might be part of Carrefour's operations in other store types. For Georgia, hypermarkets are 1, so that would align with opening stores in the same year as their first store. Macedonia has no data for supermarkets but does have a hypermarket.\n\nNow, I need to see if there's any country that opened a Carrefour store before these two. Looking at the table, countries like France (1960), Italy (1993), Greece (1991), Spain (1973), Poland (1997), Portugal (1991), Romania (2001), Germany isn't listed but others are.\n\nWait, looking back, the claim is about being the first. But the data shows that countries like France have a much earlier first store date in 1960. That would mean Carrefour has been present in Europe for decades before Georgia and Macedonia's 2012 entries.\n\nSo, does it matter if other countries had Carrefour stores before? The claim is about Georgia and Macedonia being the first, so even if they are not actually the very first, maybe among the ones listed, or perhaps the claim is incorrect because there were earlier countries with Carrefour stores.\n\nWait, no. The table shows that some countries opened their first store much earlier than 2012, like France in 1960 and Spain in 1973. So Georgia and Macedonia's first store was in 2012, which is later than many other countries listed. Therefore, they are not the first overall.\n\nBut the claim says \"Georgia and Macedonia be the first country to open a Carrefour store.\" That would mean that no other country has done so before them, but clearly France, Spain, Italy, etc., have much earlier entries. So the claim is false because other countries have already opened Carrefour stores long before Georgia and Macedonia did in 2012.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure if the table lists all relevant countries or only a subset. The table includes countries from Albania up to United Kingdom. It's possible that not all countries are listed, but based on the data given, many have earlier dates than 2012.\n\nSo, the claim is false because there were countries with Carrefour stores opening much earlier than Georgia and Macedonia did in 2012.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because other countries, such as France (1960), Spain (1973), Greece (1991), and Italy (1993), opened their first Carrefour store earlier than 2012.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Spain have lower discounter store than Romania\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. The term \"discounter store\" refers to stores in the \"hard discounters\" column because those are typically places that offer lower prices through bulk selling and minimal services. So, when the claim says Spain has lower discounter stores than Romania, it's comparing the number of hard discounters in Spain to those in Romania.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the values for both Spain and Romania in the \"hard discounters\" column. Let me locate their rows:\n\n- For Spain, the row is 14th (since it starts from 0? Wait, no, actually, looking back, the list goes up to 18 countries. Spain is the 13th country (index 13?), but perhaps I should count each row's index properly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at each row as per their order in the markdown table. The first row after headers is Albania, then Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Georgia, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Monaco, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, United Kingdom.\n\nSo Romania is the 12th country (index 11 if starting from 0). Spain is the 13th (index 12).\n\nNow, checking their \"hard discounters\" columns:\n\n- For Romania: The value is \"-\". Wait, looking back at the table, under \"hard discounters\", Romania has a \"-\" which probably means there are no hard discounters. So that's zero.\n\nWait, but in some cases, \"-\" might mean no data or not applicable. But if it's \"-\", does that mean zero? Or is it possible that the \"-\" is just a placeholder?\n\nWait, looking at other countries:\n\n- Albania: -\n- Belgium: -\n- Bulgaria: -\n- Cyprus: -\n- France: 897\n- Georgia: -\n- Greece: 397\n- Italy: -\n- Macedonia: -\n- Monaco: -\n- Poland: -\n- Portugal: 365\n- Romania: -\n- Spain: 2912 (Wait, no. Looking again:\n\nFrance has 897 in hard discounters.\n\nGreece: 397\n\nItaly: -\n\nSpain: 2912? Wait no, the table shows for Spain: under \"hard discounters\" it's 2912.\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\n| spain          | 1973          | 172            | 115            | 2912               |\n\nYes, so Spain has 2912 hard discounters.\n\nFor Romania, according to the table, it's \"-\", which likely means zero. So Spain has more than zero, while Romania has zero or no data.\n\nWait, but some countries have \"-\" because they don't have that type of store. For example, Monaco has \"-\" in \"first store\" and \"hypermarkets\", so maybe it's a different situation.\n\nBut for the claim, we're focusing on hard discounters. So Spain's hard discounters are 2912, and Romania's is \"-\", which I think means zero or not applicable, but likely zero because other countries without that type of store have \"-\".\n\nTherefore, Spain has more discounter stores than Romania. So the claim says \"Spain have lower discounter store than Romania,\" which would be false because Spain actually has a higher number.\n\nWait, no: wait, if Spain's hard discounters are 2912 and Romania's is \"-\", then Spain has more. So the claim that Spain has lower discounter stores than Romania is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about how \"-\" is interpreted. If \"-\" means zero or just not applicable. In many cases, if a country doesn't have any hard discounters, it's marked with \"-\", but sometimes it could mean data isn't available.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this table, \"-\" indicates the number of stores is zero. So for Romania, \"-\" would be 0, while Spain has 2912.\n\nTherefore, Spain does not have lower discounter stores; it has higher. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Spain has fewer discounter stores than Romania. From the table, Spain's hard discounters count is 2912, whereas Romania's is \"-\", which likely means zero. Therefore, Spain has more discounter stores, making the claim false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The claim refers to \"hard discounters,\" so we focus on the \"hard discounters\" column.\n2. **Locate Spain and Romania in the Table:** Spain is row 13 (index 12), and Romania is row 11 (index 10).\n3. **Extract Values:**\n   - Spain: 2912\n   - Romania: \"-\" (interpreted as 0)\n4. **Compare Values:** 2912 > 0, so Spain has more discounter stores.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"hard discounters\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"hard discounters\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"france have lower supermarket and hypermarket than turkey\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim into two parts:\n1. France has lower supermarkets than Turkey.\n2. France has lower hypermarkets than Turkey.\n\nSo, I should look at the \"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\" columns for both France and Turkey in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country with various stores listed. Let me locate France and Turkey in the table.\n\nFor France:\n- The \"supermarkets\" column has a value of 1021.\n- The \"hypermarkets\" column has a value of 221.\n\nFor Turkey:\n- The \"supermarkets\" column has a value of 99.\n- The \"hypermarkets\" column has a value of 73.\n\nNow, let's compare these numbers. \n\nStarting with supermarkets: France has 1021 supermarkets, while Turkey has only 99. So, in terms of the number of supermarkets, France has more than Turkey. That means the first part of the claim (\"lower supermarkets\") is false because 1021 is higher than 99.\n\nNext, looking at hypermarkets: France has 221 hypermarkets, and Turkey has 73. Again, France has a higher number here as well (221 > 73). So the second part of the claim that France has lower hypermarkets is also false.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are comparing France's numbers to Turkey's and finding that France has more in each category, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"france have lower supermarket and hypermarket than turkey\" is **FALSE** because France has a higher number of supermarkets (1021) and hypermarkets (221) compared to Turkey's 99 supermarkets and 73 hypermarkets.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Carrefour operates more supermarket than hypermarket\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about comparing Carrefour's operations in terms of supermarkets versus hypermarkets. So, I need to look at how many supermarkets and hypermarkets Carrefour has across different countries.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various countries along with numbers under columns like first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. My focus here is on the 'supermarkets' and 'hypermarkets' columns because the claim is about comparing these two.\n\nNow, I need to check if Carrefour operates more supermarkets than hypermarkets. To do this accurately, I should look for rows where Carrefour's data is relevant. That means checking each row for countries where Carrefour has both supermarkets and hypermarkets listed. If a country doesn't list either, it's not relevant for the comparison.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Albania: First store is 2011, but there are no hypermarkets or supermarkets listed here. So, this row isn't relevant.\n2. Belgium: Here, hypermarkets are 45 and supermarkets are 370. But I'm not sure if these numbers are for Carrefour specifically. The 'first store' in 2000 might be Carrefour's first store, but the hypermarkets and supermarkets columns might represent other retailers as well. So, it's unclear if this data is about Carrefour.\n3. Bulgaria: Only 5 hypermarkets and 3 supermarkets are listed, but again, not sure if these are Carrefour's.\n4. Cyprus: 7 hypermarkets and 8 supermarkets, unsure if they belong to Carrefour.\n5. France: The first store was in 1960. The hypermarkets column has 221, and supermarkets have 1021. This seems significant because the numbers are quite high, which might indicate a large presence.\n6. Georgia: 1 hypermarket and 1 supermarket, but again, not sure if it's Carrefour.\n7. Greece: 28 hypermarkets and 210 supermarkets, uncertain about ownership.\n8. Italy: 45 hypermarkets and 485 supermarkets, likely not all Carrefour.\n9. Macedonia: Only 1 hypermarket, no supermarkets, so not relevant.\n10. Monaco: Only 1 supermarket listed, not sure if it's Carrefour.\n11. Poland: 84 hypermarkets and 277 supermarkets, probably not all Carrefour.\n12. Portugal: No data for hypermarkets or supermarkets, so irrelevant.\n13. Romania: 25 hypermarkets and 50 supermarkets, likely not specific to Carrefour.\n14. Spain: 172 hypermarkets and 115 supermarkets. The claim about Carrefour might be relevant here because the numbers are high.\n15. Slovakia: No data for hypermarkets or supermarkets, so irrelevant.\n16. Slovenia: 15 hypermarkets and 12 supermarkets, likely not all Carrefour.\n17. Turkey: 73 hypermarkets and 99 supermarkets, probably not specific to Carrefour.\n18. United Kingdom: No data for hypermarkets or supermarkets, so not relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, the rows that might be relevant are France, Spain, and possibly others where the numbers are high enough to suggest a significant presence by Carrefour. In France, the number of supermarkets is 1021 vs. 221 hypermarkets, which means more supermarkets than hypermarkets in that country. Similarly, in Spain, there are 172 hypermarkets and 115 supermarkets. Wait, that's more hypermarkets than supermarkets.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if these numbers represent Carrefour specifically. The table might be listing all supermarket chains, including competitors like Intermarch\u00e9 or Leclerc in France, and other chains in Spain. So, the data isn't necessarily about Carrefour alone. Therefore, it's possible that the claim is based on incorrect assumptions.\n\nTo confirm whether Carrefour operates more supermarkets than hypermarkets globally, I'd need specific data on their operations. But since this table aggregates data across multiple retailers, it's unclear if it represents Carrefour's own network. Without knowing which rows specifically refer to Carrefour, the comparison can't be accurately made.\n\nSo, based on the given information, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because it's not clear which numbers pertain to Carrefour. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
