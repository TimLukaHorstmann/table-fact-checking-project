    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"euro 2000 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if there's a match where the competition is \"euro 2009 qualifying\" (I think it's a typo and should be 2000) and the score is 3-0.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Row 0: date - 5 June 1999, venue - Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku, score - 3-0, result - 4-0, competition - Euro 2000 qualifying.\n   - Here, the competition is \"Euro 2000 qualifying\" and the score is 3-0. This matches the claim.\n\n2. Row 1: date - 18 August 1999, venue - Dynamo Samarkand Stadium, score - 3-1, result -5-1, competition - friendly.\n   - Competition is \"friendly,\" which doesn't match. Score isn't 3-0 either.\n\n3. Row 2: date - 4 September 1999, venue - Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, score -1-0, result -1-1, competition - Euro 2000 qualifying.\n   - Competition matches, but the score is 1-0, not 3-0.\n\n4. Row 3: date -26 February 2001, venue - National Sport Base Sportpalace, Varna, score -1-0, result -1-0, competition - friendly.\n   - Doesn't match competition or score.\n\n5. Row 4: date -6 June 2001, venue - Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, score -2-0, result -2-0, competition -2002 World Cup qualification.\n   - Competition is different, so no match.\n\n6. Row 5: date -17 August 2005, venue - Qemal Stafa Stadium, score -0-1, result -2-1, competition - friendly.\n   - Doesn't match at all.\n\nSo, only row 0 meets both conditions: the competition is \"Euro 2000 qualifying\" and the score is 3-0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cell is row 0, column \"competition.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"euro 2001 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 1\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's saying that in a match where the score was 3-1, the competition was the Euro 2001 qualifying. So I need to look for any matches in the table where the score is exactly 3-1 and check what competition they were part of.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has the following columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First row**: \n   - Date: 5 June 1999\n   - Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n   - Score: 3-0\n   - Result: 4-0\n   - Competition: Euro 2000 qualifying\n   - The score here is 3-0, which doesn't match the claimed 3-1. So this row isn't relevant.\n\n2. **Second row**: \n   - Date: 18 August 1999\n   - Venue: Dynamo Samarkand Stadium, Samarkand\n   - Score: 3-1\n   - Result: 5-1\n   - Competition: Friendly\n   - Here, the score is 3-1. But the competition is listed as \"Friendly\", not Euro 2001 qualifying. So this row partially matches but doesn't support the claim.\n\n3. **Third row**: \n   - Date: 4 September 1999\n   - Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n   - Score: 1-0\n   - Result: 1-1\n   - Competition: Euro 2000 qualifying\n   - The score is 1-0, which doesn't match. So no relevance here.\n\n4. **Fourth row**: \n   - Date: 26 February 2001\n   - Venue: National Sport Base Sportpalace, Varna\n   - Score: 1-0\n   - Result: 1-0\n   - Competition: Friendly\n   - Again, the score is 1-0. Not relevant.\n\n5. **Fifth row**: \n   - Date: 6 June 2001\n   - Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n   - Score: 2-0\n   - Result: 2-0\n   - Competition: 2002 World Cup qualification\n   - The score is 2-0. Doesn't match.\n\n6. **Sixth row**: \n   - Date: 17 August 2005\n   - Venue: Qemal Stafa Stadium, Tirana\n   - Score: 0-1\n   - Result: 2-1\n   - Competition: Friendly\n   - Here, the score is 0-1. Not relevant.\n\nAfter going through each row, I see that only the second row has a score of 3-1. However, in that case, the competition is \"Friendly\", not Euro 2001 qualifying. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true because there's no match with a 3-1 score where the competition was Euro 2001 qualifying.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in a game where the score was 3-1, the competition was \"euro 2001 qualifying\". However, upon reviewing the table, only one game had a 3-1 score, but it was under a Friendly competition. There's no such match supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
