    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"rijeka's outgoing manager be nenad gra\u010dan.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the row for rijeka in the table. Scanning through each row until I find rijeka.\n\nLooking at the markdown table:\n\n1. rnk split\n2. slaven belupo\n3. istra 1961\n4. lokomotiva\n5. hrvatski dragovoljac\n6. rijeka\n7. hrvatski dragovoljac again\n\nSo, rijeka is row number 6 (since it's the sixth item in the table). Now, I need to check the column for outgoing manager. In the table headers, the columns are: team, outgoing manager, etc.\n\nIn row 6, under \"outgoing manager\", the value is nenad gra\u010dan. So that matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because rijeka's outgoing manager is indeed nenad gra\u010dan.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out correctly with the provided table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"ivan pudar from team hrvatski dragovoljac be the outgoing manager for mutual consent.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means.\n\n- \"ivan pudar\": This is the name of a person.\n- \"team hrvatski dragovoljac\": This refers to the football club Hrvatski Dragovoljac.\n- \"outgoing manager\": So, someone who was leaving a position as manager.\n- \"for mutual consent\": The manner in which they left.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team and various details about the outgoing manager and their departure. The relevant columns here are:\n\n1. **team**: This is the name of the team.\n2. **outgoing manager**: The person who was managing the team before leaving.\n3. **manner of departure**: How they left the position.\n4. **replaced by**: Who took over as manager.\n5. **date of appointment**: When the new manager started.\n\nSo, the claim is about ivan pudar being an outgoing manager for mutual consent from Hrvatski Dragovoljac.\n\nI need to check each row in the table to see if this matches any entry.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: team rnk split, outgoing manager ton\u0107i ba\u0161i\u0107, manner removed from position. Doesn't match.\n- Row 1: slaven belupo, zlatko dali\u0107, mutual consent. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: istra 1961, ante mi\u0161e, sacked. No.\n- Row 3: lokomotiva, roy feren\u010dina, mutual consent. No.\n- Row 4: hrvatski dragovoljac, damir bi\u0161kup, removed from position. Close, but different manager.\n- Row 5: rijeka, nenad gra\u010dan, mutual consent. No.\n- Row 6: hrvatski dragovoljac, ivan pudar, mutual consent. Yes! This matches.\n\nSo, in row 6, the team is Hrvatski Dragovoljac, outgoing manager is ivan pudar, manner of departure is mutual consent. All parts of the claim are satisfied here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 6 for \"outgoing manager\" and possibly other columns if needed, but since the claim only mentions three aspects (team, outgoing manager, manner), those are sufficient.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each row in the table. The specific cells that confirm the claim are located at row 6 under the columns \"team,\" \"outgoing manager,\" and \"manner of departure.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "ivan pudar depart team lokomotiva with mutual consent",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ivan pudar depart team lokomotiva with mutual consent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n1. The person: ivan pudar\n2. The action: depart team\n3. The team: lokomotiva\n4. The manner of departure: mutual consent\n\nNow, I'll go through each column in the table to find relevant cells.\n\nStarting with \"team\", the claim mentions \"lokomotiva\". Looking at the table, there are two entries for this team:\n- Row 3 (index 3): lokomotiva\n- Row 7 (index 7): lokomotiva\n\nNext, I need to check if ivan pudar is associated with lokomotiva. In row 4 (index 4), the \"replaced by\" column says ljupko petrovi\u0107, and in row 6 (index 6), it's elvis scoria. Hmm, but wait, looking at row 7, which is another entry for lokomotiva, the \"replaced by\" column is davor mladina, not ivan pudar. So maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the \"outgoing manager\" or \"manner of departure\" columns. Let me check each row related to lokomotiva.\n\nRow 3 (lokomotiva) has an outgoing manager as roy feren\u010dina and was replaced by ljupko petrovi\u0107. The manner of departure is mutual consent, which matches the claim's last part.\n\nNow, looking at row 7, it says:\n- Team: lokomotiva\n- Outgoing manager: ivan pudar\n- Manner of departure: mutual consent\n- Replaced by: davor mladina\n- Date of vacancy: 7 2010\n\nSo in this row, ivan pudar was the outgoing manager for lokomotiva with mutual consent. That matches all parts of the claim except that the team name is still lokomotiva.\n\nWait, but the original claim says \"depart team lokomotiva\", which would imply that ivan pudar left the team, making him no longer part of it. However, in row 7, ivan pudar was replaced by davor mladina, so he did depart the team. So both rows 3 and 7 are about lokomotiva departing, but with different outgoing managers.\n\nSo the claim specifically mentions ivan pudar as the one departing, which is true for row 7. Therefore, the relevant cells would be row 7's \"team\", \"outgoing manager\", \"manner of departure\", and the date might not matter, but perhaps it does? Wait, the claim doesn't specify a date, so maybe only the team, outgoing manager, and manner are needed.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim is about ivan pudar departing lokomotiva with mutual consent, which matches row 7 exactly. So that's one relevant cell for each of those columns: \"team\" (row 7), \"outgoing manager\" (row 7), and \"manner of departure\" (row 7). But in the JSON example, they included row indices as integers starting from 0. So row 7 is index 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should also consider if there's another entry where ivan pudar departs, but looking at the table, only row 7 has him departing lokomotiva with mutual consent. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n- row 7: team (lokomotiva), outgoing manager (ivan pudar), manner of departure (mutual consent).\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because all parts of the claim are supported by these cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"mile petkovi\u0107 replace ante mi\u0161e for the team slaven belupo\". \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see how it matches with the information in the table.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. Mile Petkovi\u0107 replaces someone.\n2. He does so for the team Slaven Belupo.\n\nLooking at the table, let me first locate where Slaven Belupo is mentioned. The table shows that Slaven Belupo's outgoing manager is zlatko dali\u0107, and he was replaced by mile petkovi\u0107. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, the claim says Mile Petkovi\u0107 replaced ante mi\u0161e. But looking at the table for Slaven Belupo's replacement, it shows that the person being replaced is zlatko dali\u0107, not ante mi\u0161e. Ante mi\u0161e is mentioned in another row, specifically under Istra 1961 where he was replaced by Robert Jarni.\n\nSo the claim seems to mix up who was being replaced. Mile Petkovi\u0107 did replace someone for Slaven Belupo, but that someone is zlatko dali\u0107, not ante mi\u0161e.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"replaced by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
