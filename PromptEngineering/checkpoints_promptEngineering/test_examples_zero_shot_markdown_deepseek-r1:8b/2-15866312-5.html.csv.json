    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"sandrine testud yone kamio be semi finalist the week of 22 may\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the table and see if there's any information related to sandrine testud yone kamio being a semi finalist in the week of May 22nd. The table has several columns: week of, tier, winner, runner-up, and semi finalists. \n\nLooking at the rows for the week of May 22, I see two entries:\n\n1. In the first row under week 22 may (row index 6), the tier is III. The winner is Lindsay Davenport against Kimiko Date, and the semi finalists are Sandrine Testud Yone Kamio and someone else.\n\n2. The second entry for week 22 may (row index 7) also has Lindsay Davenport as the winner against Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez, with semi finalists being Sandrine Testud Yone Kamio and another player.\n\nSo in both cases, Sandrine Testud Yone Kamio is listed as a semi finalist during week 22 May. That directly supports the claim that she was a semi finalist that week.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells. The claim specifically mentions \"semi finalist,\" so I need to make sure I'm focusing on that column. The row indices for week 22 may are rows 6 and 7, both under tier III and with her as a semi finalist.\n\nTherefore, the information in these cells supports the claim being TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 , conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini and helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce be winner , runner - up , and semi finalist respectively in the week of may 8 tier 1.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down, the claim mentions three people: Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva, Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini, and Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce. The claim states that:\n\n1. Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva is the winner.\n2. Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini is the runner-up.\n3. Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce is the semi-finalist.\n\nThese should all be in the week of May 8, tier 1.\n\nNow, I'll need to check each part of this claim against the table provided. The table has several rows and columns: week of, tier, winner, runner-up, and semi-finals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the week of May 8, tier i (since it's mentioned as tier 1 in the claim). Scanning through the table:\n\nLooking for \"week of\" May 8 and tier i. \n\nRow 3: week of 8 may, tier iv, winner is Julie Halard, runner-up is Ludmila Richterov\u00e1, semi-finals are Katar\u00edna Studen\u00edkov\u00e1 and Stephanie Rottier.\n\nRow 4: same week, different tier (iv) with Linda Harvey-Wild Chanda Rubin as the winner.\n\nWait, in the table, under May 8 may:\n\n- There are two entries for May 8, both tier i and iv. Wait, no, looking closer:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the table structure. The table seems to have multiple rows per week, possibly different tiers.\n\nLooking at the table again, each row corresponds to a specific event on a particular week. For May 8 (week of 8 may), there are two entries:\n\n1. tier iv: winner Julie Halard, runner-up Ludmila Richterov\u00e1.\n2. tier i: winner Conchita Mart\u00ednez, runner-up Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva being the winner in May 8, tier 1.\n\nLooking through the table for May 8 and tier i:\n\nIn row 5 (May 15), there are two entries: tier i winners including Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva vs Conchita Mart\u00ednez.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the first row is week 1 may, then 8 may, then 15 may, etc.\n\nSo in May 8 (row 3 and 4):\n\n- Row 3: tier iv, winner Julie Halard.\n- Row 4: tier i, winner Conchita Mart\u00ednez.\n\nNo Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva as a winner on May 8 tier 1. \n\nNext, looking for Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva as a winner. She appears in row 6 and 7 (May 15), but those are tier i and iv.\n\nWait, actually, in the last two rows:\n\nRow 28: week of May 29, tier grand slam: winners include Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva.\n\nBut that's a different week. The claim is about May 8.\n\nSo, Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva isn't listed as a winner on May 8 tier i. Instead, Conchita Mart\u00ednez is the winner in row 4 (May 8, tier i).\n\nWait, but the claim says Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva is the winner. That doesn't align with the table.\n\nAlso, looking at the runners-up and semi-finals for May 8:\n\nIn row 4: runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini.\n\nIn the claim, it's stated that Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini is the runner-up. But according to the table, she is the winner in tier i (row 4) against Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva?\n\nWait, no. Let me look at row 4 again:\n\nWeek of May 8, tier i: winner is Conchita Mart\u00ednez 6-3, 6-1.\n\nRunner-up is Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario.\n\nWait, but the claim says runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini. That doesn't match.\n\nSimilarly, the semi-finals for May 8 tier i (row 4) are Katar\u00edna Studen\u00edkov\u00e1 and Stephanie Rottier, as per row 3's semi-finals.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva is not a winner on May 8 tier 1.\n- Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini is the winner, not the runner-up.\n- The runner-up is Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario.\n- The semi-finalists are Katar\u00edna Studen\u00edkov\u00e1 and Stephanie Rottier.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statements about Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva being the winner and Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini being the runner-up don't align with the table data. There's a mix-up in their positions for May 8 tier i.\n\nAdditionally, Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce isn't mentioned at all in the table for May 8. She appears later in May 15 and May 29.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is incorrect because:\n\n1. Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva isn't the winner on May 8 tier i.\n2. Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini is the winner, not the runner-up.\n3. Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce isn't listed as a semi-finalist on that week.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states positions for Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva and Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini for May 8 tier i, with no mention of Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Claim\": \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 , conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini and helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce be winner , runner - up , and semi finalist respectively in the week of may 8 tier 1.\",\n  \"Verification\": {\n    \"Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva\": {\n      \"Position\": \"Not a winner on May 8, tier i.\",\n      \"Evidence\": \"Winner was Conchita Mart\u00ednez.\"\n    },\n    \"Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini\": {\n      \"Position\": \"Winner, not runner-up.\",\n      \"Evidence\": \"Runner-up was Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario.\"\n    },\n    \"Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce\": {\n      \"Position\": \"Not mentioned as semi-finalist on May 8.\",\n      \"Evidence\": \"Semi-finalists were Katar\u00edna Studen\u00edkov\u00e1 and Stephanie Rottier.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Conclusion\": \"Claim is incorrect.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various weeks, tiers, winners, runners-up, and semi-finals. The claim is: \"22 may 22 may be a week when the winner be sandrine testud.\" Hmm, wait, that doesn't make much sense at first glance because it seems like there's a typo or maybe a misstatement.\n\nWait, looking closer, maybe it's supposed to say \"22 may\" as the week, and in that week, the winner was Sandrine Testud. So I need to check if in any of the rows for week 22 May, the winner is Sandrine Testud.\n\nLet me go through each row where the week is 22 May. Looking at the table:\n\n- The first row under 22 may has tier iii and winner Lindsay Davenport.\n- The second row under 22 may also has tier iii with Lindsay Davenport as the winner.\n\nSo, in both cases for week 22 May, the winner is Lindsay Davenport, not Sandrine Testud. That means there's no row where the winner is Sandrine Testud on that week. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because she wasn't the winner that week.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check all possible rows again to make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through each week:\n\n- Week 1 May: Winners are conchita mart\u00ednez and gigi fern\u00e1ndez.\n- Week 8 May: Winners include Julie Halard, Linda Harvey-Wild Chanda Rubin, Conchita Mart\u00ednez, and Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez.\n- Week 15 May: Winners are Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario, Amanda Coetzer, Ludmila Richterov\u00e1, and Mariaan de Swardt.\n- Week 22 May: Only Lindsay Davenport as the winner in both entries.\n- Week 29 May (Grand Slam): Winners are Steffi Graf and Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nNo row shows Sandrine Testud as a winner. So the claim is definitely false because there's no evidence of her winning in week 22 May.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to find all cells that could verify this claim. The claim refers to week 22 May, so I should look at rows where the week is 22 May. That would be row indices 6 and 7 (since it's a markdown table with headers starting at index 0).\n\nIn those rows, the relevant columns are \"winner.\" So each of those cells needs to be checked. Therefore, the relevant_cells would include the two rows where the winner column is Lindsay Davenport, as that's what actually happened.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"when week be 9 may , when semi finalist be helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce , and when runner - up be conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini , winner be gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the provided table. The table has columns: week of, tier, winner, runner-up, and semi finalists.\n\nSo, I'll go through each condition step by step.\n\n1. **Week is May 9**: Looking at the table, the weeks listed are May 1, May 8, May 15, May 22, and \"29 may 2 weeks\" (which might be week 29 but only two weeks in this set). I don't see a week for May 9. The closest is May 8 and May 15. So the claim mentions week 9 May, which isn't present in the table. That's a red flag.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"week of 29 may 2 weeks\" refers to week 29, but it's stated as two weeks? I'm not sure. If there's no week for 9 May, that alone makes the claim false because the week condition isn't met. However, let me check further in case I missed something.\n\nWait, looking again: The last row is labeled \"29 may 2 weeks,\" which might mean it's the final week. So perhaps the table doesn't have a week for May 9. Therefore, the first part of the claim (week being 9 May) isn't supported by the table.\n\nBut maybe I'm supposed to interpret \"when week be 9 may\" as existing in the table, but since it's not there, the entire claim is false regardless of other conditions.\n\nHowever, let me proceed to check all parts to be thorough.\n\n2. **Semi finalists include Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce**: Looking at each row where May 15 is the week (since that's the closest after May 8 and before May 22). In the May 15 row under \"semi finals,\" we have \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce.\" So this condition is met.\n\n3. **Runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini**: Again, in the same May 15 row, the runner-up is listed as conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini. That's correct.\n\n4. **Winner is Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva with scores 3-6,7-6,6-4**: In the May 15 row, tier i winner is \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" with scores 3-6,7-6,6-4. That matches.\n\nSo, all three conditions except for the week seem to be met in the May 15 row.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"when week be 9 may,\" which isn't present. So even though the other parts match, the week doesn't exist in the table. Therefore, the entire statement is false because the condition about the week isn't satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the weeks. Let me double-check the table. The weeks are:\n\n- May 1\n- May 8\n- May 15\n- May 22\n- \"29 may 2 weeks\"\n\nNo May 9. So the claim's first condition is not met.\n\nBut in the example given, if all conditions are met, it's TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. Since week 9 May isn't present, the answer should be FALSE regardless of other conditions.\n\nWait, but I need to see which cells are relevant. The user said to return a JSON with \"relevant_cells\" as well, listing the row indices and column names that support the claim or contradict it.\n\nBut in this case, the first condition (week being 9 May) isn't met because there's no such week in the table. So the relevant cells would be those that show the other conditions are true but maybe not relevant for the overall false statement.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused about how to structure the \"relevant_cells\" part. The instructions say: if fully supported, return TRUE; else, FALSE. And include the relevant cells as per checking each condition.\n\nSo, perhaps I should identify which cells were checked, even if the overall claim is false. So for the week being 9 May, since it's not present, that's a failure. But for the other parts (semi finals, runner-up, winner), they are correct in the May 15 row.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include:\n\n- The cell(s) for May 15, 2023 or whatever year, under week of to show the other conditions are met.\n- Also, maybe the cells showing that there's no week 9 May, but I'm not sure if negative data is included.\n\nWait, the example given had two relevant_cells entries. So perhaps in this case, for the claim, since the week isn't present, it's false. But to show which rows are relevant, maybe we need to include the row where the other conditions are met (May 15), and also note that there is no May 9 row.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I should include negative information or just positive. The instructions say: \"You are not supposed to provide any python code.\" So perhaps the relevant_cells are only the ones supporting the claim's true parts, even though overall it's false because of the missing week.\n\nAlternatively, since the week is incorrect, maybe all four columns (week, tier, winner, runner-up) need to be checked. The winner, runner-up, and semi-finals match in May 15, but the week doesn't exist.\n\nSo perhaps the relevant_cells would include:\n\n1. Row with May 15: columns week of, winner, runner-up, semi-finals.\n2. But also, since the week is incorrect, maybe a row indicating no May 9 week.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. The main point is that the claim includes a condition (week 9 May) that isn't met, so it's false. However, for the relevant_cells, I should probably list all cells checked to verify each part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the cells would be:\n\n- week of: for May 15 and May 9\n- semi finalists: for May 15\n- runner-up: for May 15\n- winner: for May 15\n\nBut since May 9 doesn't exist, that's a no. So in the JSON, I need to include all rows where these conditions are checked.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to list only the cells that support the claim. Since the week condition is false, and the others are true, perhaps the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- The May 15 row for winner, runner-up, semi-finals.\n- Also, since the claim mentions week 9 May, which doesn't exist, maybe a cell indicating no such week.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example given had two cells, but in this case, more might be relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user just wants the rows that match the claim's conditions, excluding the week since it's false. But I'm not entirely sure. To stay safe, maybe include all rows checked for each part of the claim.\n\nSo:\n\n- For the week condition: check May 15 and see if there's a May 9. Since May 9 isn't present, that's a failure.\n- For semi-finals: only May 15 has Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce.\n- Runner-up: same row.\n- Winner: same row.\n\nThus, relevant_cells would include:\n\n1. Row index where week is May 15 (let's say it's row 3)\n   - columns: week of, winner, runner-up, semi-finals\n2. Additionally, since the claim mentions May 9, perhaps check that there's no such row. But I don't know how to represent that in cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only include the rows where conditions are met, regardless of others. So, only the May 15 row is relevant for the other parts, but the week condition isn't met elsewhere.\n\nBut I'm a bit stuck on how to structure this. Maybe it's better to just list all rows that were checked in relation to each part of the claim.\n\nIn any case, my initial thought is that since the week 9 May doesn't exist, the entire claim is false. But for the relevant_cells, I should include the row where the other conditions are met (May 15) and possibly note that there's no week 9 May.\n\nBut I'm not sure if including negative data is necessary. The example didn't have negatives, just positives.\n\nSo perhaps in the JSON, I'll list only the cells from May 15 as relevant because they meet the semi-finals, runner-up, and winner conditions, even though the overall claim fails due to the incorrect week.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes a condition that the week is May 9, which does not exist in the table. Therefore, the claim is false. However, the other conditions (semi-finalists, runner-up, winner) are met in the May 15 row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"isTrue\": false,\n  \"relevantCells\": [\n    {\n      \"rowIndex\": 3,\n      \"columns\": [\"week of\", \"winner\", \"runner-up\", \"semi-finals\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
