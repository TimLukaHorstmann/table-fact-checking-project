    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be no competition in women 's single in the following year : 1992 , 1996 , 1999 , 2000 , 2006 , and 2007.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's about checking if there was no competition in the women's singles category for those specific years: 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for each year, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a specific year and shows whether competitions were held in those categories.\n\nSince the claim is specifically about women's singles, I should focus on the \"women 's singles\" column. The relevant rows are for the years mentioned: 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007.\n\nI'll go through each of these years one by one to check if there was no competition in women's singles.\n\nStarting with 1992: Looking at the row for 1992, under \"women 's singles,\" it says \"no competition.\" That matches the claim.\n\nNext, 1996: Similarly, the row for 1996 also states \"no competition\" in women's singles. So that checks out too.\n\nNow, 1999: The row for 1999 shows \"no competition\" in both men's and women's singles. So again, no competition in women's singles here.\n\n2000: For the year 2000, it says \"no competition\" under women's singles as well. That aligns with the claim.\n\nMoving on to 2006: The row for 2006 indicates \"no competition\" in women's singles. Same goes for 2007: It also shows \"no competition.\"\n\nSo, all the specified years have no competition in women's singles according to the table. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones corresponding to each of these years in the \"women 's singles\" column. Each year has its own row index, so I'll list those with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be no competition in the women double the year that there be no competition in both the men double and the men single.\" \n\nHmm, breaking it down, I think the claim is saying that in a particular year where both the men's doubles and men's singles have no competition, there should also be no competition in the women's doubles. So, whenever the men's doubles and men's singles are without competition, the women's doubles must also not have any competition.\n\nNow, I need to check each year in the table to see if this condition holds true. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at 1991: Men's singles has Arthur chatschatourow, so there is a competition. Men's doubles are missing, which probably means no competition. But since men's singles have someone, it doesn't meet the condition of both being no competition. So this year doesn't apply.\n\n1992-1996: The entire range shows no competition in both men's singles and men's doubles (since there's \"no competition\" for men singles and doubles). For these years, I need to check if women's doubles also have no competition.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In 1992-1996, the men's singles column says \"no competition,\" and the men's doubles are also \"no competition.\" So for each year in this range (1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996), I need to verify if women's doubles are also \"no competition.\"\n\nLooking at the women's doubles column: For each of these years, it says \"no competition\" as well. So that seems to support the claim. But wait, the instruction is to check whether whenever both men's doubles and singles have no competition, the women's doubles must also not have competition.\n\nSo in 1992, 1993, etc., since both men's doubles and singles are \"no competition,\" then women's doubles should also be no competition, which they are. So that would make the claim true for those years.\n\nBut wait, I need to check all relevant rows where both conditions hold. Let me list out the years where both men's singles and doubles have no competition.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1991: Men's singles has a name, so no.\n- 1992-1996: Men's singles are \"no competition,\" men's doubles also \"no competition.\"\n- 1997: Men's singles and doubles have names, so no.\n- 1998: Same as above.\n- 1999-2000: Men's singles and doubles have no competition.\n- 2001: Men's singles and doubles have names, but wait, men's singles is mjawia malchas, which is a name, so competition exists. So no for the condition.\nWait, no: in 2001, men's singles have someone (mjawia malchas), so there's competition. Therefore, the condition of both being no competition isn't met.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make it clearer:\n\nFor each year, check if both men's singles and men's doubles are \"no competition.\" Then, in that same year, check women's doubles.\n\nSo let's go row by row.\n\n1991: Men's singles has a name, so not applicable.\n\n1992-1996: Let's take 1992. Men's singles: no competition. Men's doubles: no competition. So for 1992, women's doubles must also be no competition.\n\nLooking at the table, for 1992, women's doubles are \"no competition.\" Same for 1993-1996. So in all these years, women's doubles match the condition.\n\nNext, 1997: Men's singles have someone (mjawia malchas), so both conditions aren't met.\n\n1998: Similarly, men's singles have someone, so no.\n\n1999-2000: Men's singles and doubles are \"no competition.\" So for these years:\n\nLooking at women's doubles in 1999 and 2000. Both say \"no competition,\" which aligns with the claim.\n\n2001: Men's singles have a name (mjawia malchas), so no.\n\n2002: Men's singles have mamuka dsodsuaschwili, so no.\n\n2003: Men's singles have edgar eremian, so no.\n\n2004: Men's singles have nodar sardlischwili. So no competition? Wait, \"nodar sardlischwili\" is a name, so there is a competition in men's singles. Therefore, the condition of both being no competition isn't met here.\n\nWait, actually, let me check: For 2004, men's singles are \"nodar sardlischwili,\" which implies competition exists. So not applicable.\n\n2005: Men's singles have mamuka dsodsuaschwili, so competition exists.\n\n2006-2007: Men's singles and doubles are \"no competition.\" So for these years:\n\nLooking at women's doubles in 2006 and 2007: Both are \"no competition.\"\n\nSo summarizing, every year where both men's singles and doubles have no competition, the women's doubles also have no competition.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true across all applicable years. Thus, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as in each year where both men's singles and doubles had no competition, women's doubles also had none.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is true or false based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"there be no competition in women 's double or in men 's double in the year when arthur chatschatourow win the men 's single.\" \n\nOkay, so the claim is making two points. It says that in the specific year when Arthur Chatschatourow won the men's singles, there should be no competition in both the women's doubles and men's doubles.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify the relevant years where Arthur Chatschatourow won the men's singles. From the table:\n\n- In 1991, Arthur chatschatourow is listed as the winner of men's singles.\n- Then from 1992 to 1996, it says \"no competition\" for men's singles.\n- The next mention of a name in men's singles is Mjawia Malchas in 1997 and onwards.\n\nSo, Arthur Chatschatourow only won in 1991. That's the specific year we're interested in checking for no competitions in women's doubles and men's doubles.\n\nNow, let's look at the women's doubles column for 1991. The table shows \"inga beridse\" as the winner. For men's doubles in 1991, it says \"no competition.\" So that part checks out.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about two things: women's doubles and men's doubles. In 1991, women's doubles had a competition with \"inga beridse,\" which means there was a winner, so there was indeed a competition. However, the claim says \"no competition\" in both. That's a problem because women's doubles did have a competition that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because in 1991, when Arthur won, there was a competition in women's doubles, which contradicts the statement.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"there be a lot of competition in women's singles in the following year: 1992, 1996 / 1999, 2000 / 2006, and 2007.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the term \"a lot of competition\" means here. It likely refers to whether there was a competition (i.e., someone participated) or not in women's singles for those specific years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, and each column corresponds to different types of competitions: men's singles, women's singles, etc. For this claim, I'm only concerned with the \"women 's singles\" column.\n\nLet me go through each relevant year mentioned in the claim one by one:\n\n1. **1992**: Check the row for 1992 in the women's singles column. According to the table, it says \"no competition.\" So, no competition in 1992.\n\n2. **1996**: Similarly, looking at the 1996 row (but wait, I need to check if the year is listed as 1996 or if it's combined with another). Wait, looking back, the rows for 1991 and 1997 onwards have specific years. The row from 1992-1996 probably refers to each of those years in that range having \"no competition.\" So 1996 would also be no competition.\n\n3. **1999**: Looking at the 1999 row. It says \"no competition\" for women's singles as well.\n\n4. **2000**: The 2001 row is labeled as 2001, but it seems like from 2001 to 2007, some years have combined entries. Wait, in the table, the rows are structured with multiple years sometimes. For example, the first data row after 1991 is 1992 1996, meaning both 1992 and 1996 had no competition. Similarly, the last data row before 2003 is labeled as 2001, but then there's a separate row for 2004-2007.\n\nWait, I think it might be better to parse each year individually. Let me list all the years mentioned in the claim: 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007.\n\nNow, let's go through each:\n\n- **1992**: Women's singles - no competition.\n- **1996**: Women's singles - no competition.\n- **1999**: Women's singles - no competition.\n- **2000**: Looking at the row for 2001 (which includes 2001, but also mentions that from 2001 to 2007, some have competitions). Wait, maybe I need to check each year individually.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the years in the table and their corresponding women's singles entries:\n\n- 1991: no competition\n- 1992: no competition\n- 1997: gaiane tschachoian\n- 1998: gaiane tschachoian\n- 1999: no competition\n- 2001: gaiane tschachoian\n- 2002: no competition\n- 2003: no competition\n- 2004: natela mirianaschwili\n- 2005: ina davidowa\n- 2006: no competition\n- 2007: no competition\n\nSo, the claim is about women's singles competitions in 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 1992: No competition.\n- 1996: No competition (since it falls under the same range as 1992).\n- 1999: No competition.\n- 2000: According to the table, in 2001 row, for 2000 it's no competition. Wait, actually, looking at the 2001 row: \"no competition\" for women's singles? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the rows are:\n\n- 1991\n- 1992 1996 (meaning both years have no competition)\n- 1997\n- 1998\n- 1999 2000 (both have no competition)\n- 2001\n- 2004\n- 2005\n- 2006 2007 (both have no competition)\n\nWait, actually, for the year 2000: looking at the row labeled 1999 2000, which is \"no competition\" for women's singles. So yes, 2000 had no competition.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- 2006 and 2007: Both have \"no competition.\"\n\nSo all the years in the claim (1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007) have \"no competition\" in women's singles. Therefore, there is no competition in these years.\n\nThe claim says that there should be a lot of competition in these years.

The claim says: \"Natia Marianaschwili Tschachoian Gaiane win the women's double every year after 2001.\" So I'll start by understanding what each part of this claim means.\n\nFirst, let me break down the terms in the claim. \"Women's doubles\" refers to a specific category in the table, which is under the column \"women 's doubles\". The players mentioned are Natia Marianaschwili and Tschachoian Gaiane. So I need to check if this pair won the women's doubles every year after 2001.\n\nLooking at the table structure: It has columns for each year from 1991 onwards, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a specific year, with entries under these categories. \n\nNow, focusing on the \"women 's doubles\" column, I'll go through each relevant row to see if Natia and Gaiane won that category. The claim specifies \"every year after 2001,\" so I need to check from 2002 onwards.\n\nStarting with 2002: In the women's doubles for 2002, it says \"no competition.\" So no win there.\n\n2003: Also shows \"no competition.\"\n\n2004: The entry is \"natela mirianaschwili ina davidowa.\" Hmm, so that's a different pair\u2014Natela and Ina. Not Natia and Gaiane, so they didn't win in 2004.\n\n2005: The women's doubles winners are \"natela mirianaschwili ina davidowa\" again, same as 2004. So not the pair we're looking for.\n\n2006: No competition listed.\n\nSo from 2002 to 2007 (since the last entry is 2006 and 2007 shows no competition), Natia and Gaiane don't win any women's doubles titles after 2001.

Wait, no. The row for 2001 under men's doubles is \"mjawia malchas georgi enukidse,\" which means there was a competition.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out the years and their men's doubles status:\n\n1991: No\n1992-1996: No\n1997: Yes\n1998: Yes\n1999-2000: No\n2001: Yes (mjawia malchas georgi enukidse)\n2002: No competition (no)\n2003: No\n2004: Competition (nodar sardlischwili edgar eremian)\n2005: Competition (mamuka dsodsuaschwili gia djanelidse)\n2006-2007: No\n\nSo the years with no competition in men's doubles are 1991, 1992-1996, 1999-2000, 2002, 2003, 2007.\n\nNow, for each of these years, check if women's doubles had a lot of competition and Arthur won men's singles.\n\nFirst condition: In the same year as no men's doubles competition, is there \"a lot of competition\" in women's doubles? Let's see:\n\n- 1991: Women's doubles - no\n- 1992-1996: No\n- 1999-2000: No\n- 2002: No\n- 2003: No\n- 2007: No\n\nSo in all these years, women's doubles also had no competition. Therefore, the first part of the claim is not supported because when there's no competition in men's doubles, women's doubles also have none.\n\nNow, the second condition: In that same year, Arthur Chatschatourow won the men's singles. Looking at the table:\n\nArthur Chatschatourow was the winner in 1991 (men's singles). Let me check if in 1991, women's doubles had competition. No, it didn't\u2014women's doubles were also no competition.\n\nSo in 1991: men's doubles - no; women's doubles - no; Arthur won men's singles. But the claim requires that when there is a lot of competition in women's doubles (which isn't happening in this year), but in this same year, he won. However, since women's doubles didn't have competition, the first part doesn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about two things:\n\n1. In the same year where men's doubles had no competition, women's doubles had a lot of competition.\n2. In that same year, Arthur won the men's singles.\n\nSo looking for a year where both happen: no competition in men's doubles and Arthur wins, while also having a lot of competition in women's doubles.\n\nBut from the table:\n\n- 1991: Men's singles - Arthur; men's doubles - no; women's doubles - no\n- 2002: Women's singles had no, but men's singles for 2002 was mamuka dsodsuaschwili. Arthur isn't mentioned here.\nWait, in which years did Arthur win?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- 1991: Arthur Chatschatourow won men's singles.\n\nOther mentions of Arthur: I don't see him after 1991. So only in 1991 he won.\n\nNow, check for other years where men's doubles had no competition and women's doubles had a lot of competition. But from the table, whenever men's doubles had no competition (like 1991, 1992-96, etc.), women's doubles also had none. So there's no year where men's doubles have no competition and women's doubles have competition.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported because in any year when men's doubles had no competition, women's doubles also didn't. Therefore, the condition for a lot of competition in women's doubles isn't met in those years. Additionally, Arthur only won in 1991, but that year doesn't have women's doubles competition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **false** because there is no year where men's doubles had no competition while women's doubles had a lot of competition, and Arthur Chatschatourow only won in 1991 when both doubles categories had none. \n\nAnswer: The claim is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"in 2003 , there be no competition for men 's double and women 's double , but edgar eremian play in the mixed double.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being claimed here. It says that in 2003, there was no competition in both men's doubles and women's doubles, but Edgar Eremian played in the mixed doubles. So, my goal is to verify this using the given table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for each year from 1991 onwards, including men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a specific year and lists whether there was competition in each category.\n\nI need to focus on the year 2003. Let me find the relevant row for 2003. Scanning through the table, I see:\n\n| 2003      | edgar eremian         | gaiane tschachoian    | no competition                       | no competition                          | no competition                          |\n\nSo, for 2003:\n- Men's singles: Edgar Eremian\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachorian\n- Men's doubles: No competition\n- Women's doubles: No competition\n- Mixed doubles: No competition\n\nNow, the claim says two things about 2003:\n1. There was no competition in men's doubles and women's doubles.\n2. Edgar Eremian played in the mixed doubles.\n\nLooking at the table for 2003, under men's doubles and women's doubles, it indeed shows \"no competition.\" So point one is confirmed.\n\nNext, checking if Edgar Eremian played in the mixed doubles in 2003. In the same row for 2003, under mixed doubles, it says \"no competition.\" That suggests that either there was no mixed doubles event or Edgar wasn't part of it because there was no competition. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps \"no competition\" doesn't necessarily mean that the player didn't play but rather that the specific category had no event that year. So if the mixed doubles column for 2003 says \"no competition,\" does that mean Edgar wasn't part of any mixed doubles? Or is there a possibility that he played in an alternative capacity?\n\nHmm, this might be a bit tricky. The claim states that Edgar Eremian did play in the mixed doubles, despite no competition in men's and women's doubles. But according to the table, in 2003, all three categories (men's doubles, women's doubles, mixed doubles) show \"no competition.\" So if there was no mixed doubles event, then it's possible that Edgar Eremian didn't play in any mixed doubles that year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of his name in men's singles implies he could have participated elsewhere, but the table doesn't specify individual participation beyond the categories. The table only indicates whether there was competition in each category for that year.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is that in 2003, men's and women's doubles had no competition, which aligns with the table, but also claims that Edgar played in mixed doubles when there was none, that part of the claim might not hold. Or perhaps the claim is implying that despite no competition in men's and women's doubles, Edgar participated in mixed doubles, even if it wasn't an official event.\n\nWait, but according to the table, there was no competition in mixed doubles for 2003 either. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because all three categories had no competition, meaning Edgar didn't participate in any of them that year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again.\n\nThe table for 2003:\n- Men's singles: Edgar Eremian\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachorian\n- Men's doubles: No competition\n- Women's doubles: No competition\n- Mixed doubles: No competition\n\nSo, in 2003, while Edgar was playing men's singles, there were no competitions in the other three categories. Therefore, he didn't participate in any of those.\n\nThe claim says that in 2003, there was no competition in men's and women's doubles (which is correct), but Edgar played in mixed doubles. However, according to the table, there was no mixed doubles competition either. So if \"no competition\" implies that the event didn't take place or he wasn't part of it, then perhaps the claim is incorrect because he couldn't have played in mixed doubles if there was none.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim means that even though there was no competition in those categories, Edgar participated anyway, which might be possible. But the table doesn't provide information on individual player participation beyond whether the category had a competition or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"no competition\" refers to whether there was an event for that particular category in that year. So if a category had no competition, it means either it wasn't held or Edgar didn't participate in it. But without more details, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I think the safest approach is to check each part of the claim against the table. The first part about men's and women's doubles having no competition is accurate for 2003. However, the second part claims that Edgar played in mixed doubles, but according to the table, there was no mixed doubles competition that year. Therefore, it's not supported.\n\nWait, but perhaps \"no competition\" doesn't mean the category didn't exist or wasn't played, but rather that no one participated. But I'm not sure about that interpretation either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in 2003, while men's singles had an entry for Edgar, perhaps he also participated in mixed doubles, even if there was no official event. That's a bit of a stretch, but possible.\n\nBut looking at the table, for 2003, all three categories show \"no competition.\" So, it's possible that none of those events took place or had participants. Therefore, Edgar Eremian didn't play in any of them.\n\nSo, the claim is making two statements:\n1. In 2003, men's doubles and women's doubles had no competition.\n2. In 2003, Edgar played in mixed doubles.\n\nThe first part is correct. The second part isn't directly supported by the table because it shows \"no competition\" for mixed doubles as well. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because while men's and women's doubles didn't have competitions, there was also no mixed doubles event where he could have played.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. The presence of Edgar in men's singles doesn't necessarily imply participation in other categories unless there was a competition in those categories. Since the table shows \"no competition\" for those categories, it might mean that he didn't participate in them either.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that Edgar played in mixed doubles when, according to the table, there was no mixed doubles competition. So both parts of the claim are correct: men's and women's had no competition, and mixed also did, so Edgar didn't play in any of them.\n\nWait, but then the claim says he did play in mixed, which contradicts the table. Therefore, the entire claim is false because while the first part is correct (no competitions), the second part is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that \"no competition\" could mean that there was no event, but individuals might still participate in other contexts, though it's unlikely.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the best conclusion is that the claim is partially true regarding men's and women's doubles having no competition but incorrect about Edgar playing in mixed doubles since that category also had no competition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made by the user contains two parts: one accurate and one not supported by the provided data.\n\n1. **Men's Doubles and Women's Doubles:** The table confirms that in 2003, both men's doubles and women's doubles had \"no competition,\" which aligns with the first part of the claim.\n   \n2. **Mixed Doubles Participation:** The second part of the claim suggests that Edgar Eremian played in mixed doubles. However, according to the table, the mixed doubles category also showed \"no competition\" for 2003. This implies that there was no event or participation in mixed doubles during that year. Therefore, it is not supported that Edgar participated in any mixed doubles event in 2003.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim correctly states that there was no competition in men's and women's doubles in 2003 but incorrectly asserts that Edgar Eremian played in mixed doubles for that year, as the table indicates no such participation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe first part of the claim is accurate, while the second is not supported by the provided data.",
