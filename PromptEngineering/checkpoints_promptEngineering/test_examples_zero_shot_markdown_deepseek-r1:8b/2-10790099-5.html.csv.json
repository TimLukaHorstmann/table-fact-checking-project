    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"north melbourne have the highest home team score in the list.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about a specific aspect: the home team's score for north melbourne. So I should focus on two columns: home team and home team score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match, with details like the home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. My task is to check if north melbourne's home team score is the highest among all listed.\n\nSo I'll start by identifying all the rows where the home team is \"north melbourne.\" From the table, there's only one such row, which is the fifth row (index 4) with home team north melbourne and their score being 18.10 (118). \n\nNext, I need to compare this score against other home teams in the same column. The home teams listed are footscray, fitzroy, carlton, north melbourne, richmond, and south melbourne. For each of these, I should look at their respective scores.\n\nLet me list out all the home team scores:\n- footscray: 13.14 (92)\n- fitzroy: 12.6 (78)\n- carlton: 13.15 (93)\n- north melbourne: 18.10 (118)\n- richmond: 13.18 (96)\n- south melbourne: 14.15 (99)\n\nNow, comparing these scores numerically:\n- 18.10 is the highest among all. The next highest is south melbourne at 14.15.\n\nTherefore, north melbourne's score of 118 is indeed higher than all other home teams in this list. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nRegarding the relevant cells, I need to specify which columns and rows are checked. The claim refers to \"home team score,\" so I look at the column named \"home team score.\" Since north melbourne's row is the only one for that home team, their score cell in \"home team score\" is the one I need. So, the relevant cells include both the \"row_index\" (which is 4) and the \"column_name\" (\"home team score\").\n\nI should also check if any other rows are considered, but since we're only looking for north melbourne's home score, it's only their specific cell that matters. There's no need to consider the away teams or other columns like venue or crowd.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is TRUE because north melbourne's home team score of 118 is higher than any other home team in the list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the team geelong have the highest away team score in the list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down how I should approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. The user is saying that Geelong, as an away team, has the highest score among all teams listed here. So my task is to check each row where Geelong is the away team and see what their score is compared to other away teams' scores.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it's a markdown table with several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match between a home team and an away team.\n\nNow, the claim specifically mentions Geelong as the away team. So I need to find all rows where Geelong is listed in the \"away team\" column. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. First row: The away team is st kilda with a score of 8.10 (58).\n2. Second row: The away team is geelong, which is what we're interested in. Their score is 20.10 (130).\n3. Third row: The away team is collingwood with a score of 11.7 (73).\n4. Fourth row: The away team is melbourne with a score of 12.16 (88).\n5. Fifth row: The away team is hawthorn with a score of 6.9 (45).\n6. Sixth row: The away team is essendon with a score of 9.11 (65).\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake there. In the second row, the home team is fitzroy and the away team is geelong. So that's correct. But in the third row, the away team is collingwood, so that's not Geelong. Similarly, in the fourth row, the away team is melbourne. Fifth row, hawthorn; sixth row, essendon.\n\nSo only one row has Geelong as the away team: the second row with a score of 20.10 (130). Now I need to check if this is the highest score among all away teams.\n\nLooking at all the away team scores:\n- st kilda: 8.10 (58)\n- geelong: 20.10 (130)\n- collingwood: 11.7 (73)\n- melbourne: 12.16 (88)\n- hawthorn: 6.9 (45)\n- essendon: 9.11 (65)\n\nSo the highest score among away teams is indeed Geelong's 20.10 (130). None of the other away teams have a higher score than that.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any rows or miscalculate. Let's list all away team scores:\n- st kilda: 8.10 \u2192 58\n- geelong: 20.10 \u2192 130\n- collingwood: 11.7 \u2192 73\n- melbourne: 12.16 \u2192 88\n- hawthorn: 6.9 \u219245\n- essendon:9.11\u219265\n\nYes, 130 is the highest here.\n\nSo the claim is that Geelong has the highest away score, which seems to be TRUE based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are in row 1 (since Geelong is the second row, but indexing starts at 0). The column is \"away team score\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"prince park be the venue which have the largest crowd in the list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. My focus here is on the \"venue\" and \"crowd\" columns because that's what the claim is about.\n\nThe claim says that Prince Park is the venue with the largest crowd. So I need to check which venues are listed in the table and their corresponding crowd numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, the venues listed are:\n- Western Oval\n- Brunswick Street Oval\n- Princes Park\n- Arden Street Oval\n- Punt Road Oval\n- Lake Oval\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Prince Park. Scanning through the list, I see that Prince Park is indeed one of the venues, so it's in the list.\n\nNext, I need to compare the crowd numbers for each venue to determine if Prince Park has the largest. Let me extract the crowd figures:\n\n- Western Oval: 14,000\n- Brunswick Street Oval: 13,000\n- Princes Park: 32,000\n- Arden Street Oval: 12,000\n- Punt Road Oval: 10,000\n- Lake Oval: 28,000\n\nNow, let's list them in order from largest to smallest:\n1. Princes Park: 32,000\n2. Lake Oval: 28,000\n3. Western Oval: 14,000\n4. Brunswick Street Oval: 13,000\n5. Arden Street Oval: 12,000\n6. Punt Road Oval: 10,000\n\nFrom this, I can see that Princes Park has the highest crowd number with 32,000 followers. Lake Oval is next with 28,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Prince Park is the venue with the largest crowd is TRUE because it indeed has the highest crowd count among all the venues listed in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the \"crowd\" column for the venue \"Prince Park\".

The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. My focus here is on the \"crowd\" column because that's what the claim is referring to.\n\nI need to find the row for \"arden street oval.\" Looking at the table, I see a row where the venue is \"arden street oval.\" That's in the 4th row (if we start counting from 0, it would be index 3). The crowd for this match is 12000. \n\nNext, I need to find the crowd number for \"punt road oval.\" Scanning through the table, there's a venue named \"punt road oval\" in the 5th row (index 5), with a crowd of 10000.\n\nThe claim states that arden street oval has 2000 more people than punt road oval. So I should calculate the difference between these two crowd numbers. \n\n12000 (arden) minus 10000 (punt) equals 2000. That matches exactly what the claim is saying: there's a crowd of 2000 more at arden street oval compared to punt road oval.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. I should make sure that I'm checking only the relevant cells. The \"crowd\" column is where both venues' attendances are listed, so those are the key columns to look at for this claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"the second largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's in markdown format with several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game, so each row has its own set of data.\n\nThe claim is about the second largest crowd being at Lake Oval. So I need to find out which venues have crowds and then determine if Lake Oval is hosting the second largest crowd.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the 'venue' column lists several places: western oval, brunswick street oval, princes park, arden street oval, punt road oval, and lake oval. Each of these has a corresponding crowd number.\n\nI need to extract the crowd numbers for each venue. Let me list them out:\n\n- Western Oval: 14,000\n- Brunswick Street Oval: 13,000\n- Princes Park: 32,000\n- Arden Street Oval: 12,000\n- Punt Road Oval: 10,000\n- Lake Oval: 28,000\n\nNow, I need to determine which venue has the second largest crowd. To do that, I should first identify what is the largest and what is the second largest.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n32,000 (Princes Park), 28,000 (Lake Oval), 14,000 (Western Oval), 13,000 (Brunswick Street Oval), 12,000 (Arden Street Oval), and 10,000 (Punt Road Oval).\n\nThe largest crowd is at Princes Park with 32,000. The next largest is Lake Oval with 28,000. Therefore, the second largest crowd is indeed at Lake Oval.\n\nSo the claim says that the second largest crowd is at Lake Oval, which matches our findings. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. Each row corresponds to a specific game. The relevant cells would be the ones containing the 'crowd' data for Lake Oval and the next largest, Princes Park.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Lake Oval is in the fifth row (index 5) under the 'venue' column.\n- Princes Park is in the third row (index 3).\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n1. The cell at row index 5, column 'crowd'.\n2. The cell at row index 3, column 'crowd'.\n\nI should list these as a JSON array with their respective indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Lake Oval hosts the second largest crowd of 28,000, following Princes Park's 32,000.

They're talking about the home team scores, specifically for south melbourne, and whether they are the highest among all listed home teams.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant information here is the \"home team score\" column because that's what we're comparing.\n\nNow, to verify the claim, I need to identify all the home teams listed in the table and their corresponding scores.

South melbourne has a score of 99, which is lower than 118.\n\nSo, since south melbourne's home team score isn't the highest, the claim must be false.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I didn't miss any other teams. Let me double-check the table. There are six home teams listed: footscray, fitzroy, carlton, north melbourne, richmond, and south melbourne. Their scores range from 78 to 118.

The row index for this entry would be 4 because it's the fifth row. Under the venue column, it says \"lake oval,\" and under the crowd column, it shows a number: 28,000.\n\nNext, I need to check if any other venues have a higher crowd number than 28,000. So I'll go through each row's crowd column:\n\n- Footscray: 14,000\n- Fitzroy: 13,000\n- Carlton: 32,000 (Wait, that seems high)\n- North Melbourne: 12,000\n- Richmond: 10,000\n- South Melbourne: 28,000\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount the crowd numbers correctly:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n1. Footscray: 14,000\n2. Fitzroy: 13,000\n3. Carlton: 32,000 (This seems to be the highest so far)\n4. North Melbourne: 12,000\n5. Richmond: 10,000\n6. South Melbourne: 28,000\n\nWait no, that's not correct.

Then, the next highest is 28,000 at lake oval.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says \"lake oval\" has the largest crowd.

Not applicable.\n6. **Row 5**: Home team is South Melbourne, away team is Essendon. Not relevant.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed some rows where Geelong could be the away team. Let me check again more carefully:\n\nLooking at each row's \"away team\" column:\n\n- Row 0: St Kilda\n- Row 1: Geelong\n- Row 2: Collingwood\n- Row 3: Melbourne\n- Row 4: Hawthorn\n- Row 5: Essendon\n\nSo, only Row 1 has Geelong as the away team. Their score is 20.10 (130). Now I need to see if this is the lowest among all away teams.\n\nI should collect all away team scores from each row:\n\n- St Kilda's score when they are away: Since St Kilda isn't listed in the 'away team' column except in Row 0, but actually, looking again, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no\u2014each row is a home vs away match, so the 'away team' is who they're playing against.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all away team scores:\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- St Kilda (as away): N/A because in Row 0, St Kilda is the home team? Wait, no. In the first row, \"footscray\" is the home team, \"st kilda\" is the away team. So St Kilda's score when they are away would be... but in this table, we only have their performance when they're away if they are the away team in another row.\n\nWait no, each row represents a match where one team is home and the other is away. So the \"away team\" column lists who is visiting.\n\nTherefore, to collect all away team scores, I need to list the away team's score for each row:\n\nRow 0: St Kilda (away) scored 8.10 (58)\nRow 1: Geelong (away) scored 20.10 (130)\nRow 2: Collingwood (away) scored 11.7 (73)\nRow 3: Melbourne (away) scored 12.16 (88)\nRow 4: Hawthorn (away) scored 6.9 (45)\nRow 5: Essendon (away) scored 9.11 (65)\n\nSo now, the away team scores are:\n\n- St Kilda: 8.10 (58)\n- Geelong: 20.10 (130)\n- Collingwood: 11.7 (73)\n- Melbourne: 12.16 (88)\n- Hawthorn: 6.9 (45)\n- Essendon: 9.11 (65)\n\nLooking at these scores, the lowest is Hawthorn with 6.9 (45), followed by Essendon's 9.11 (65), then Collingwood's 11.7 (73), Melbourne's 12.16 (88), St Kilda's 8.10 (58), and Geelong's 20.10 (130).\n\nSo the lowest away team score is Hawthorn at 45, not Geelong.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the team geelong have the lowest away team score in the list\" is FALSE because when Geelong was away (in Row 1), their score was higher than several others, including Hawthorn and Essendon. So Geelong's away score isn't the lowest.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim compares Geelong's away score with all other away scores. So, I should look at each row where the away team has a lower score than Geelong's 130. Alternatively, since we're checking if Geelong is the lowest, we can compare their score against others.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider which cells are relevant for determining this. The relevant columns would be \"away team\" and \"away team score.\"\n\nThe row where Geelong is the away team (Row 1) is definitely relevant because that's the specific data point in question.\n\nAdditionally, to determine if it's the lowest, we need to compare with all other away teams' scores. So, any row where the away team's score is less than 20.10 (130). Since Hawthorn scored 6.9, which is lower, their cell (Row 4) is also relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1: Geelong as away team and their score.\n- Row 4: Hawthorn as away team and their score.\n\nWait, but in the context of checking if Geelong has the lowest, we need to see all other away scores. So perhaps all rows except where Geelong is the home team? No, actually, each row is a home vs away, so all \"away team\" entries are relevant for comparing their scores.\n\nSo, all columns under \"away team score\" are relevant because they are part of the comparison. But that might be too broad. Alternatively, perhaps only the cells where the away team's score is compared to Geelong's.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the away team scores as I did earlier:\n\nSt Kilda: 58\nGeelong:130\nCollingwood:73\nMelbourne:88\nHawthorn:45\nEssendon:65\n\nSo, only the cells for Hawthorn (6.9) and Essendon (9.11), Collingwood (11.7), Melbourne (12.16), St Kilda (8.10) are lower than Geelong's 130.\n\nThus, each of these away team entries is relevant because they contribute to determining whether Geelong has the lowest.\n\nAlternatively, since we're checking if Geelong is the lowest, it's necessary to compare all away scores, so all \"away team score\" cells except when Geelong is the home team. But in this table, Geelong isn't a home team, only an away team once.\n\nWait, actually, each row is a unique match: so for the purpose of checking if Geelong is the lowest, we need to see their own away score and compare it with all other away scores across all rows.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1 (Geelong as away, 130)\n- Rows 0,2,3,4,5 (all \"away team\" scores)\n\nBut that's too broad. The user might want to know which specific data points are compared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the Geelong away score and all other away scores except where they're the home team. But in this table, Geelong is only an away team once.\n\nTherefore, to check if Geelong has the lowest away score, we need:\n\n- Their own away score (Row 1)\n- All other away teams' scores (Rows 0,2,3,4,5)\n\nSo all \"away team score\" columns are relevant because they're part of the data set for comparison.\n\nBut that's too many. Alternatively, since Geelong is only in Row 1 as an away team, maybe just their own cell and the ones with lower scores.\n\nWait, perhaps the relevant cells are:\n\n- All rows where the away team scored less than Geelong's 130 (which includes Hawthorn, Essendon, Collingwood, Melbourne, St Kilda)\n- And Geelong's own away score.\n\nSo the specific away teams' scores that are lower: Hawthorn (Row4), Essendon (Row5), Collingwood (Row2), Melbourne (Row3), St Kilda (Row0). Each of these has a relevant cell because their scores affect the comparison.\n\nTherefore, I think the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row1: Geelong's away score\n- Rows0,2,3,4,5: All other away team's scores.\n\nBut to keep it concise, perhaps the specific rows where the away team scored lower than Geelong's 130 are:\n\nRows0 (St Kilda:58), Row2 (Collingwood:73), Row3 (Melbourne:88), Row4 (Hawthorn:45), Row5 (Essendon:65).\n\nEach of these is relevant because they have a lower score than Geelong's.\n\nSo, in total, the cells that are relevant include:\n\n- Row1: Geelong as away team with 130\n- Rows0,2,3,4,5: Each of their away team scores (since they're less than 130)\n\nTherefore, these would be the relevant cells to check if Geelong has the lowest away score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the team geelong have the lowest away team score in the list\" is false. Geelong's away score was higher than several other teams, including Hawthorn and Essendon.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:** \n   - The task requires comparing Geelong's away performance with others.\n   \n2. **Extract Away Team Scores:**\n   - From the table, compile all \"away team score\" values:\n     - St Kilda: 8.10 (58)\n     - Geelong:20.10 (130)\n     - Collingwood:11.7 (73)\n     - Melbourne:12.16 (88)\n     - Hawthorn:6.9 (45)\n     - Essendon:9.11 (65)\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Score:**\n   - Compare all away scores:\n     - Hawthorn: 6.9 (45) is the lowest.\n     - Followed by Essendon:9.11 (65), Collingwood:11.7 (73), Melbourne:12.16 (88), St Kilda:8.10 (58), and Geelong:20.10 (130).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Hawthorn's score is lower than Geelong's, the claim that Geelong has the lowest away score is incorrect.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row1 (Geelong as away team with 130)\n- Rows0,2,3,4,5 (Other away team scores: St Kilda, Collingwood, Melbourne, Hawthorn, Essendon)\n\nThe final answer is that Geelong does not have the lowest away score; Hawthorn holds that distinction.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the third largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the third biggest crowd size in the table occurred at Lake Oval. To verify this, I need to check two things: identify the crowd sizes, determine which is the third largest, and see if that corresponds to Lake Oval.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"crowd\" number. Let me list them out:\n\n- Footscray: 14,000\n- Fitzroy: 13,000\n- Carlton: 32,000\n- North Melbourne: 12,000\n- Richmond: 10,000\n- South Melbourne: 28,000\n\nNow, I need to order these from largest to smallest. The highest is Carlton at 32,000. Next is South Melbourne with 28,000. Then Footscray at 14,000, Fitzroy at 13,000, North Melbourne at 12,000, and Richmond at 10,000.\n\nWait, let me double-check that order to make sure I'm not missing anything. Carlton definitely has the highest with 32k. South Melbourne is next at 28k. Then Footscray is 14k? Wait, no, because South Melbourne is 28k, which is more than Footscray's 14k. So after Carlton and South Melbourne, it should be Footscray at 14k, then Fitzroy at 13k, North Melbourne at 12k, Richmond at 10k.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 28k is larger than 14k. So the order would be:\n\n1. Carlton - 32k\n2. South Melbourne - 28k\n3. Footscray - 14k? Wait no, that can't be. Because 28k is more than 14k, so after Carlton and South Melbourne, it should be Footscray at 14k, then Fitzroy at 13k, North Melbourne at 12k, Richmond at 10k.\n\nWait, but looking back, the crowd numbers are:\n\nCarlton:32k\nSouth Melbourne:28k\nFootscray:14k\nFitzroy:13k\nNorth Melbourne:12k\nRichmond:10k\n\nSo ordering them from largest to smallest would be:\n\n1. Carlton - 32,000\n2. South Melbourne - 28,000\n3. Footscray - 14,000\n4. Fitzroy - 13,000\n5. North Melbourne - 12,000\n6. Richmond - 10,000\n\nSo the third largest crowd is Footscray with 14,000.\n\nNow, the claim says that the third largest is at Lake Oval. Looking back at the table, each row has a \"venue\" column. South Melbourne's game was at Lake Oval, and their crowd was 28,000, which we've already established as second largest. So the third largest, Footscray, is not at Lake Oval; instead, it's at Western Oval.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The third largest is Footscray with 14,000, and their venue is Western Oval. South Melbourne, with 28,000, is at Lake Oval. So the claim says that the third largest crowd (Footscray) was at Lake Oval, which isn't correct because it's actually at Western Oval.\n\nWait no, perhaps I made a mistake in ordering. Let me recount:\n\nCarlton:32k\nSouth Melbourne:28k\nThen comes Footscray with 14k? Or is there another team with higher than 14k?\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- South Melbourne:28k\n- Carlton:32k\n- Then Footscray:14k, but wait, no. Wait, in the table, South Melbourne's crowd is 28k, which is less than Carlton's 32k.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a confusion here. Let me list all the crowd numbers:\n\nRow 0: Footscray - 14,000\nRow 1: Fitzroy -13,000\nRow 2: Carlton -32,000\nRow3: North Melb-12,000\nRow4: Richmond-10,000\nRow5: South Melb-28,000\n\nSo the order is:\n\nCarlton (32k) first.\n\nThen South Melbourne (28k).\n\nThen Footscray at 14k? Wait no, because 28k is more than 14k. So after Carlton and South Melbourne, it's Footscray with 14k, then Fitzroy at13k, North Melb at12k, Richmond at10k.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the third largest would be Footscray at 14k, not South Melbourne. But South Melbourne is higher than Footscray.\n\nSo the third largest crowd is Footscray with 14k, and their venue is Western Oval, not Lake Oval. The claim says the third largest was at Lake Oval, which is incorrect because it's actually South Melbourne (28k) that's at Lake Oval.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm mixing up the venues. Let me look at each row:\n\n- Footscray: Venue - Western Oval\n- Fitzroy: Bruno Street Oval\n- Carlton: Princes Park\n- North Melb: Arden St Oval\n- Richmond: Punt Rd Oval\n- South Melbourne: Lake Oval\n\nSo, the third largest crowd is 14k, at Western Oval (Footscray). The second largest is 28k at Lake Oval (South Melbourne). Therefore, the claim that the third largest crowd was at Lake Oval is false because it's actually at Western Oval.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again:\n\n- Carlton:32k\n- South Melb:28k\n- Then Footscray:14k? No, wait, 28k is higher than 14k, so South Melb is second, Footscray third.\n\nYes, so the third largest is Footscray at Western Oval. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not Lake Oval.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we first identify the crowd sizes and their corresponding venues:\n\n- Carlton: 32,000 (Princes Park)\n- South Melbourne: 28,000 (Lake Oval)\n- Footscray: 14,000 (Western Oval)\n- Fitzroy: 13,000 (Brunswick St Oval)\n- North Melbourne: 12,000 (Arden St Oval)\n- Richmond: 10,000 (Punt Rd Oval)\n\nThe third largest crowd is Footscray at Western Oval, not Lake Oval. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
