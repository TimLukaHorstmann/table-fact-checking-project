    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the building that remains the tallest in Montreal today be the 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. Each row represents a different building with details like name, address, years as tallest, number of years as tallest, height in meters/feet, and floors.\n\nI need to focus on two main points from the claim: \n1. That 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re is still the tallest building in Montreal today.\n2. The other buildings' data to see if they could be taller or still contenders.\n\nLooking at the 'years as tallest' column, this column indicates when each building held the title of being the tallest in Montreal. For example:\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 1829 - 1928\n- Royal Bank Building: 1928 - 1931\n- Sun Life Building: 1931 - 1962\n- Tour CIBC: 1962 (only one year)\n- Place Ville Marie: 1962 - 1964\n- Tour de la Bourse: 1964 - 1992\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 1992 - present\n\nThe claim is about the current status, so I need to check if 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is still the tallest today. The 'years as tallest' for this building is listed as \"21 years (current)\", which means it's been the tallest since 1992 and up to now. \n\nBut wait, just because a building was taller during its time doesn't necessarily mean it's still the absolute tallest today unless we have data indicating that no other building surpasses it now. From the table, all other buildings' 'years as tallest' end before 1992 except for Tour CIBC which only held it for one year in 1962 and Place Ville Marie until 1964, which is before 1992.\n\nI should check if any other buildings after 1992 have a taller height. Looking at the 'height m/ft' column:\n- Notre Dame Basilica: ~226 ft\n- Royal Bank Building: ~397 ft\n- Sun Life Building: ~400 ft\n- Tour CIBC: ~614 ft\n- Place Ville Marie: ~617 ft\n- Tour de la Bourse: ~637 ft\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: ~673 ft\n\nFrom the heights, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is the tallest with 673 feet. Since no other building in the table surpasses this height and their 'years as tallest' end before 1992, except for Tour CIBC which only held it for one year in 1962.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any buildings not listed in the table that might be taller. But since the claim is based on the given data, I can assume that within this dataset, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re remains the tallest today because its 'years as tallest' go up to present day.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to check two columns: \"name\" and \"height m/ft\". The row for 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is at index 6. \n\nWait, but looking back, the table might have a different structure. Let me recheck the markdown:\n\nThe headers are:\n- name\n- street address\n- years as tallest\n- of years as tallest\n- height m / ft\n- floors\n\nSo each row corresponds to these columns. So for 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, its row is at index 6 (since it's the last one). The relevant columns are \"name\" and \"height m/ft\".\n\nBut wait, the 'years as tallest' column might also be relevant because if another building had a taller height but only held the title for less time, we need to confirm if 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is still the tallest in terms of current height.\n\nWait no, the claim is about remaining the tallest today, so it's about current height. So the key columns are \"name\" and \"height m/ft\". Additionally, checking that its 'years as tallest' is ongoing, but perhaps the column name is 'of years as tallest', which indicates how many years it was tallest.\n\nWait, no: The table has two relevant columns for this claim:\n- The building's name to confirm it's 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re.\n- Its current height to ensure it's still the tallest.\n\nSo in the table, each row includes 'name', which is needed to identify the building, and 'height m/ft' which is needed to see if it's the tallest today. Additionally, checking that no other buildings in the dataset have a greater height than this one. Since 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re has the highest height (673 ft), and others are lower, except perhaps none higher.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n- The row for 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, specifically 'name' and 'height m/ft' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re remains the tallest building in Montreal today. Checking the table:\n\n1. **Name**: The row at index 6 is \"1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re\".\n2. **Height**: Its height is 673 feet, which is the highest among all buildings listed.\n3. No other building in the dataset surpasses this height.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE based on the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the buildings is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"regardless of both building have 47 floor , the tour de la bourse take the title of the tallest building from the place ville marie in 1964 by a mere 6 / 20 m / ft difference.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key points to check against the table.\n\n1. **Both buildings (I assume Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse) have 47 floors**: So I need to verify that both of these buildings indeed have 47 floors each as per the table.\n\n2. **Tour de la Bourse took the title from Place Ville Marie in 1964**: This suggests a change in the tallest building status around that year, so I should look at when each building was completed or became taller than the other.\n\n3. **The difference in height is 6/20 m/ft**: The claim mentions a specific height difference, which is quite small (0.3 meters). So I need to compare their heights and see if this difference holds true for the year 1964 when Tour de la Bourse supposedly took over as the tallest.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Place Ville Marie**:\n  - Name: Place Ville Marie\n  - Years as tallest: 1962 - 1964\n  - Height: 188 m / 617 ft\n  - Floors: 47\n\n- **Tour de la Bourse**:\n  - Name: Tour de la Bourse\n  - Years as tallest: 1964 - 1992\n  - Height: 194 m / 637 ft\n  - Floors: 47\n\nFirst, checking the floors: Both have 47 floors. So that part holds true.\n\nNext, when did each building become the tallest? Place Ville Marie was tallest from 1962 to 1964, while Tour de la Bourse took over from 1964 onwards. So in 1964, they were at the same height, but perhaps Tour de la Bourse became taller after that?\n\nWait, looking at their heights: Place Ville Marie is 188m/617ft and Tour de la Bourse is 194m/637ft. Wait, actually, 194 is higher than 188. So in 1964, when Tour de la Bourse started being tallest, it was taller than Place Ville Marie by 6 meters (194 - 188 = 6). The claim says a difference of 6/20 m/ft, which is indeed 0.3m/1 ft. Wait, the table gives heights in both meters and feet, so the actual difference is 6 meters.\n\nBut wait, let me calculate the exact height difference:\n\nPlace Ville Marie: 188m\nTour de la Bourse: 194m\n\nDifference: 194 - 188 = 6m.\n\nIn terms of m/ft, since 1 foot is approximately 0.3048 meters, so 6m is roughly 19.69 feet. The claim says a difference of 6/20 m/ft, which is 0.3m/ft, but that seems incorrect because the actual height difference in ft would be around 19.69ft.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the claim. It says \"by a mere 6 / 20 m / ft difference.\" So perhaps they are saying the difference is 6 meters converted to feet over meters? That doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, it's possible that there was a mistake in units.\n\nAlternatively, the height difference is 6 meters (which is about 19.69 feet), but the claim says 6/20 m/ft, which would be 0.3m per foot. But that seems odd because if you have 6m difference, converting both to ft:\n\n188m = approx 617ft\n194m = approx 637ft\n\nDifference in height is 20ft (637-617). Wait, the claim says a difference of 6/20 m/ft. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is referring to the height difference as 0.3 meters per foot? That doesn't make much sense because it's a fixed difference, not per floor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is stating that the difference was 6 meters when converted from meters to feet, which would be about 19.69 feet, but phrased as 6/20 m/ft. That might be a translation issue or confusion in units.\n\nBut regardless of the exact wording, the key points are:\n\n- Both buildings have 47 floors.\n- Tour de la Bourse became taller than Place Ville Marie starting in 1964.\n- The height difference was 6 meters (or approximately 19.69 feet), but the claim says 6/20 m/ft.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the exact wording again: \"a mere 6 / 20 m / ft difference.\" So perhaps it's 6/20 of a meter per foot? That would be 0.3m/ft, which is roughly 1 foot per 0.3 meters, but that's not how height differences work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that in 1964, Tour de la Bourse was only 6 feet taller than Place Ville Marie. But according to the table:\n\nPlace Ville Marie: ~617ft\nTour de la Bourse: ~637ft\nDifference: 20ft\n\nWait, that's a big difference of 20ft, not 6ft. So maybe there's a mistake in the claim.\n\nBut looking back at the meters:\n\n188m vs 194m is a 6m difference.\n\nSo if the claim says it's a mere 0.3m/ft difference, which would be a very small difference per floor. But that doesn't align with the actual height difference of 6m or 20ft.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim intended to say that the height difference was 6 meters (188 to 194), so a 6m difference. That makes sense because the exact difference is 6m.\n\nBut then why does it write it as \"6 / 20 m / ft\"? Maybe there's confusion between meters and feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim meant that in 1964, Tour de la Bourse became taller by 6 floors? But according to the table, both have 47 floors. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, looking again at the columns:\n\nThe table has \"height m / ft\" as a column, which is the height converted into meters and feet. For example, Notre-Dame Basilica: 69m/226ft, etc.\n\nSo Place Ville Marie's height is 188m/617ft.\nTour de la Bourse is 194m/637ft.\n\nDifference in meters: 6m (194-188).\nDifference in feet: 20ft (637-617).\n\nThe claim says \"by a mere 6 / 20 m / ft difference.\" So perhaps they are saying the height difference is 6m, which converts to approximately 19.69ft. The claim writes it as 6/20 m/ft, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's trying to express the ratio of the differences: 6 meters difference over 20 feet difference, so 6/20 = 0.3.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is whether Tour de la Bourse became taller than Place Ville Marie in 1964 by a certain amount.\n\nAccording to the table, yes, Tour de la Bourse (194m) is taller than Place Ville Marie (188m). So the difference is indeed 6 meters or approximately 20ft. The claim says \"a mere 6 / 20 m / ft difference,\" which might be trying to express that in a confusing way.\n\nSo assuming the claim is correct, both buildings have 47 floors, Tour de la Bourse became taller starting in 1964 with a height difference of approximately 0.3m/ft (which would translate to about a foot per 0.3 meters, but this doesn't make much sense as a metric for building heights).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo or confusion. But regardless, the key facts are:\n\n- Both have 47 floors.\n- Tour de la Bourse is taller than Place Ville Marie by about 6 meters.\n- The height difference in feet is around 20ft.\n\nSo the claim's wording might be slightly off, but the essential facts seem accurate: both buildings have 47 floors, and Tour de la Bourse became taller than Place Ville Marie starting in 1964 with a significant height difference.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is correct in stating that both have 47 floors, Tour de la Bourse became taller, and the height difference was about 6 meters or 20ft.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is accurate in its essential points: both the Tour de la Bourse and Place Ville Marie have 47 floors. Starting in 1964, the Tour de la Bourse became taller than the Place Ville Marie by approximately 6 meters (or about 19.69 feet), which translates to a significant height difference.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is correct in stating that both buildings have 47 floors and that the Tour de la Bourse surpassed the Place Ville Marie in height starting in 1964, with a notable height difference of approximately 6 meters.",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Notre Dame Basilica is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"From 1829 - 1928, the Notre Dame Basilica was the tallest building and still holds the record for the most years as the tallest.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant parts of the table that could support or refute this claim. The table lists several buildings along with their construction periods, the number of years they were the tallest, their height in meters and feet, and the number of floors.\n\nLooking at the Notre Dame Basilica row (row 0), its construction period is from 1829 to 1928, which matches the timeframe mentioned in the claim. The \"years as tallest\" column for this building is listed as 99 years, which means it held that title for 99 years. The height is quite substantial at 69 meters or 226 feet, and it has 7 floors.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. From 1829-1928, Notre Dame was the tallest building.\n2. It still holds the record for the most years as the tallest.\n\nStarting with the first part: During the period from 1829 to 1928, was Notre Dame the tallest? According to the table, during that time, it was indeed the tallest building as there are no other buildings listed in that range that have a higher height. The next closest is the Royal Bank Building (constructed 1928-1931) which is shorter at 121m/397ft and only 22 floors. So for the entire period from 1829 to 1928, Notre Dame was the tallest.\n\nMoving on to the second part: Does Notre Dame still hold the record for the most years as the tallest? The table shows that it held this title for 99 years (from 1829-1928). However, I should check if any other buildings in the table have a longer duration. Looking at the other rows:\n\n- Royal Bank Building: 3 years\n- Sun Life Building: 31 years\n- Tour CIBC: <1 year\n- Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n- Tour de la Bourse: 28 years\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years (current as of 1992)\n\nNotre Dame's 99-year record seems to be the longest among all. So, it still holds that record.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells would be the ones from row 0 for \"years as tallest\" and perhaps \"height m / ft\" if needed, but since the claim is about years, the key column is \"years as tallest.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported based on the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year , follow by place ville marie",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table has several buildings with various details like their names, street addresses, years as the tallest, duration of that title, height in meters and feet, and floors.\n\nThe claim is: \"the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year , follow by place ville marie.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down what this claim is saying. It seems like it's stating two things:\n\n1. Tour CIBC is the tallest building but has been so for the least number of years.\n2. Place Ville Marie comes next in terms of the duration as the tallest building.\n\nSo, my goal is to check each part of this claim against the table provided.\n\nStarting with Tour CIBC:\n\nLooking at the table, Tour CIB C is listed with several details. Specifically, under \"years as tallest,\" it says 1962, and the duration is marked as <1 year. This means that in 1962, Tour CIBC became the tallest building but didn't hold that title for a full year. It was only just starting that year.\n\nNext, Place Ville Marie:\n\nIn the table, Place Ville Marie's \"years as tallest\" are listed from 1962 to 1964, and it held that title for 2 years. So, it was taller than Tour CIB C but also for a longer duration than Tour CIB C.\n\nWait, no, actually, the claim says Tour CIBC is first with the least amount of years, followed by Place Ville Marie. But according to the table, Tour CIBC only held the title in 1962 (less than a year), and Place Ville Marie held it from 1962-1964 for two years.\n\nSo, the order would be Tour CIBC having been tallest for the least time, then Place Ville Marie for two years. That seems to align with the claim.\n\nHowever, I should also check if any other buildings might have a shorter duration than Tour CIB C or Place Ville Marie. Looking at the table:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 1829-1928, which is 99 years.\n- Royal Bank Building: 1928-1931, 3 years.\n- Sun Life Building: 1931-1962, 31 years.\n- Tour CIB C: 1962, <1 year.\n- Place Ville Marie: 1962-1964, 2 years.\n- Tour De La Bourse: 1964-1992, 28 years.\n- 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re: 1992-present, about 21 years as of current.\n\nSo, the durations are:\n\n- Royal Bank: 3 years\n- Sun Life: 31 years\n- Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n- Tour CIB C: <1 year\n- Tour De La Bourse: 28 years\n- 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years\n\nSo, the shortest duration is Tour CIB C with less than a year. Next comes Place Ville Marie at two years, then Royal Bank at three years.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"followed by place ville marie.\" So in terms of the order, it's Tour CIBC (least) followed by Place Ville Marie. That seems correct based on the table.\n\nBut I should double-check if any building after Tour CIB C has a shorter duration than Tour CIB C. Since <1 year is already the shortest possible, unless another building also had a duration less than a year but after 1962, which doesn't seem to be the case. The next buildings are Place Ville Marie (2 years), Royal Bank (3 years), Sun Life (31), etc.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold true based on the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}]}",

    "claim": "the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for close to a third of the time of the notre dame basilica",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the Sun Life Building being the tallest in Montreal for close to a third of the time that the Notre-Dame Basilica was is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll look at both buildings in the table provided. \n\nStarting with the Notre-Dame Basilica:\n- It was constructed from 1829 to 1928, which means it was around for 99 years (1928 - 1829 = 99 years).\n- Its height is approximately 69 meters or 226 feet.\n- It has 7 floors.\n\nNow, the Sun Life Building:\n- Built from 1931 to 1962, so that's 31 years (1962 - 1931 = 31 years).\n- Its height is around 122 meters or 400 feet.\n- It has 26 floors.\n\nThe claim says that the Sun Life Building remained the tallest for close to a third of Notre-Dame Basilica's time. \n\nSo, let me calculate what a third of Notre-Dame's time would be. \n99 years divided by 3 is approximately 33 years. So the claim is whether the Sun Life was the tallest for about 33 years.\n\nLooking at their construction times:\n- Notre-Dame was built from 1829 to 1928.\n- Sun Life was built in 1931, which is after Notre-Dame's time as the tallest (since it's still standing today). \n\nWait, but does that mean that Sun Life took over as the tallest building later? Let me check when each became the tallest. The claim is about how long each was the tallest.\n\nNotre-Dame was the tallest from 1829 to 1928. Then in 1931, the Sun Life Building was completed and became taller than Notre-Dame, so it started being the tallest from 1931 onwards until its own construction ended in 1962.\n\nSo, from 1931 to 1962, that's 31 years where Sun Life was the tallest. Now, comparing this to a third of Notre-Dame's time (99 years), 33 years. \n\nSince Sun Life was taller for 31 years, which is less than a third of 99, the claim might be incorrect. Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, the Sun Life Building started being the tallest in 1931, but Notre-Dame was already around from 1829 to 1928, so it's unclear how their time as the tallest overlaps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about the duration that Sun Life was taller than Notre-Dame. Since both were built much earlier, and the table shows their heights, Sun Life's height (122m/400ft) is indeed taller than Notre-Dame's 69m/226ft. So from when Sun Life was completed in 1931 until its own construction ended in 1962, it was the tallest.\n\nNotre-Dame's period as the tallest was from 1829 to 1928 (99 years). The claim says that Sun Life remained the tallest for close to a third of that time. A third is about 33 years. But Sun Life was the tallest for 31 years (from 1931 to 1962). \n\nWait, but the overlap period between Notre-Dame and Sun Life as tallest would be from when Sun Life was built in 1931 until Notre-Dame was no longer a building or something? Wait, no\u2014Notre-Dame is still standing today. So actually, after 1928, when Notre-Dame's construction ended, it remained the structure it is now. But Sun Life was taller than Notre-Dame starting from 1931.\n\nSo, from 1931 to present day, Sun Life has been the tallest for about 91 years (from 1931 to 2023). But the claim is specifically about how long Sun Life was taller compared to Notre-Dame's time as the tallest. Wait, perhaps I need to calculate if 31 years is close to a third of 99 years.\n\n31 divided by 3 is about 10.33, so a third would be around 33. So 31 is less than that, not close to a third. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Sun Life was the tallest for only 31 years, which is about 31/99 or ~31% of Notre-Dame's time, but \"close to a third\" implies closer to 33%. \n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Maybe it's not about their construction times but how long each was the tallest relative to their own existence.\n\nNotre-Dame was built in 1829 and stood until 1928 as the tallest for 99 years. Sun Life was built in 1931, so from that point onwards, it became the tallest. So the overlap time where both were present is 1931-1928? Wait, no, Notre-Dame was still there after 1928. So actually, from 1931 until now (2023), Sun Life has been taller than Notre-Dame. But the claim refers to the duration that Sun Life was the tallest compared to the time Notre-Dame was.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about how long each building was the tallest during their own existence. \n\nNotre-Dame: 99 years as the tallest from 1829-1928.\n\nSun Life: 31 years as the tallest from 1931-1962.\n\nThe claim is that Sun Life remained taller for close to a third of Notre-Dame's time, which would be about 33 years. Since Sun Life was taller for 31 years, which is just slightly less than a third (33), perhaps it's considered 'close'. But I think the exact figure is 31 vs 99: 31/99 \u2248 0.313, so about 31%, which is a little over a quarter, not quite a third.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that Sun Life was taller for approximately 33 years, but it's actually only 31, so it's close to a third. But 'close' might be subjective. However, since 31 is roughly 31% of 99, which is about 3.1/10, not exactly 33.3%.\n\nTherefore, the claim may not be fully accurate because 31 years isn't quite a third of 99.

Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and compare it with the information in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"Although Place Ville Marie has more floor than Tour de la Bourse, Tour de la Bourse takes the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant columns in the table. The columns that are mentioned in the claim are \"floors\" and \"years as tallest.\" These are the key pieces of information needed to verify the claim.\n\nNext, I'll look at each row related to Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse.\n\nFor Place Ville Marie:\n- It's located at row index 5.\n- The \"floors\" column shows 47 floors.\n- The \"years as tallest\" span from 1962 to 1964, which is a period of 2 years, so it was the tallest building during those years.\n\nFor Tour de la Bourse:\n- It's located at row index 6.\n- The \"floors\" column shows 47 floors as well. Wait, that's the same number of floors as Place Ville Marie. Hmm, that might be a point to check.\n- The \"years as tallest\" span from 1964 to 1992, which is 28 years, so it held the title for a longer period.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim more closely. It mentions that Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse but that Tour de la Bourse takes the title in 1964. \n\nLooking at the \"floors\" column:\n- Both have 47 floors. So, neither has more floors than the other. The claim states that Place Ville Marie has more floors, which is incorrect because they are equal.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the years as tallest:\n- Place Ville Marie was tallest from 1962-1964 (2 years).\n- Tour de la Bourse took over from 1964 onward, making it taller for a longer period. So in 1964, Tour de la Bourse became taller, which is what the claim suggests.\n\nHowever, since both buildings have the same number of floors, the initial part of the claim that Place Ville Marie has more floors is false. Therefore, the entire claim is incorrect because it's based on an inaccurate premise regarding the number of floors.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Place Ville Marie does not have more floors than Tour de la Bourse; they both have 47 floors. Additionally, while Tour de la Bourse took the title in 1964, the initial assertion about the floor count is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"notre dame basilica remain the tallest building in montreal today\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each column of the table to see which ones are relevant to verifying the claim. The columns are: name, street address, years as tallest, of years as tallest, height m/ft, and floors. \n\nThe claim is about whether Notre Dame Basilica remains the tallest building in Montreal today. So I need to check their current heights compared to other buildings in Montreal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with their respective details. For each building, there's information on when they were the tallest and how long that lasted. The most recent year is important here because we want to know who is the tallest now.\n\nStarting with Notre-Dame Basilica:\n- Years as tallest: 1829 - 1928\n- Of years as tallest: 99 years\n- Height: 69m/226ft\n\nNext, Royal Bank Building:\n- Years as tallest: 1928 - 1931\n- Of years as tallest: 3 years\n- Height: 121m/397ft\n\nSun Life Building:\n- Years as tallest: 1931 - 1962\n- Of years as tallest: 31 years\n- Height: 122m/400ft\n\nTour CIBC:\n- Years as tallest: 1962 (only <1 year)\n- Height: 187m/614ft\n\nPlace Ville Marie:\n- Years as tallest: 1962 - 1964\n- Of years as tallest: 2 years\n- Height: 188m/617ft\n\nTour de la Bourse:\n- Years as tallest: 1964 - 1992\n- Of years as tallest: 28 years\n- Height: 194m/637ft\n\n1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re:\n- Years as tallest: 1992 - present\n- Of years as tallest: 21 years (current)\n- Height: 205m/673ft\n- Floors: 51\n\nNow, I need to see which building is the tallest currently. The last row shows that 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re has been the tallest since 1992 and is still holding that title today with 21 years as the tallest so far. Its height is 205m/673ft.\n\nComparing heights:\n- Notre-Dame Basilica: 69m\n- Royal Bank Building: 121m\n- Sun Life Building: 122m\n- Tour CIBC: 187m\n- Place Ville Marie: 188m\n- Tour de la Bourse: 194m\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 205m\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is taller than Notre-Dame Basilica. Therefore, the claim that Notre-Dame Basilica remains the tallest is FALSE.\n\nI should identify the relevant cells in the table. The key columns are \"name\" and \"height m/ft\". Each building's row needs to be checked for height because only knowing when they were tallest isn't enough; we need their current heights. So, all rows except perhaps the first might have a higher height than Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nBut wait, actually, each building is compared individually. Since 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re has a higher height (205m vs 69m), it's taller. Therefore, the relevant cells are \"name\" and \"height m/ft\" for all rows because we need to check each building's current status against Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nWait no, perhaps not all. Since only 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is taller than Notre-Dame, maybe just that row plus the one of Notre-Dame? Hmm, but the claim is about whether Notre-Dame is still tallest, so we need to check if any building has a greater height now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"height m/ft\" column for all buildings needs to be checked against Notre-Dame's height. So I should include each row's name and their respective heights as they might surpass Notre-Dame's 69m.\n\nBut considering that only the last building (1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re) has a higher height, maybe only that one is relevant? Or perhaps all buildings' current heights need to be considered. Wait, but according to the table, each row shows when they were tallest and their current status if applicable. So 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re's \"years as tallest\" include present, meaning it's still holding that title.\n\nSo, in terms of cells, I should select all rows where \"height m/ft\" might be greater than Notre-Dame Basilica's. Alternatively, since the claim is about whether Notre-Dame is still the tallest, any building with a higher height today would make the claim false. So perhaps only 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re needs to be checked because it's taller.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row might not necessarily indicate current tallest status except for Tour CIBC and Place Ville Marie (1962-1964 and 1962). Wait no, Tour CIBC is from 1962 only <1 year, so maybe not. The last two buildings are 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re (1992-present) and Tour de la Bourse until 1992.\n\nSo the only building that is still the tallest today is 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re. Therefore, the relevant cells would be its name and height, as well as any others that might have a higher height than Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The claim is about whether Notre-Dame is the tallest today. So I need to check if there's any building taller than it now. From the table:\n\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 205m\n- Notre-Dame: 69m\n\nSo yes, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is taller. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells would be all rows because each building's height could potentially surpass Notre-Dame's. But actually, no, only those buildings that are still tallest now or have a greater current height than Notre-Dame. So 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re's row (row_index:6) is the main one, but also any others with higher heights.\n\nWait, but in the table, each building's \"years as tallest\" might not indicate they are still the tallest now unless it's present. For example:\n\n- Tour CIBC: years as tallest: 1962, of years: <1. So perhaps it's only that year.\n- Place Ville Marie: 1962-1964 (so 2 years).\n- Tour de la Bourse: until 1992.\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: from 1992 to present.\n\nSo the last two are still holding their titles. Therefore, the relevant cells would be all rows because each building's height might be compared against Notre-Dame's.\n\nBut perhaps only 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is taller than Notre-Dame. So maybe only that row is needed, but I'm not sure if other buildings have higher heights.\n\nNo, looking at the numbers:\n\n- Tour CIBC: 187m\n- Place Ville Marie: 188m\n- Tour de la Bourse:194m\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re:205m\n\nAll of these are taller than Notre-Dame's 69m. So any of their rows could be relevant because they might be taller.\n\nBut the claim is specifically about whether Notre-Dame is still the tallest, so we need to check if any building is taller than it now. Since multiple buildings have higher heights, but in reality, only the last one (1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re) is still the tallest.\n\nSo perhaps all rows except the first (Notre-Dame) should be considered because their heights might surpass it, but actually, we just need to confirm that at least one building is taller than Notre-Dame, which is true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the row of 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re and Tour de la Bourse since they are the tallest now. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about whether Notre-Dame is the tallest. If any other building is taller, regardless of when, that would make the claim false.\n\nSo in terms of cells, I think all rows' \"name\" and \"height m/ft\" should be considered because each could potentially have a higher height than Notre-Dame's 69m.\n\nBut to keep it concise, since only 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is still the tallest now, maybe just that row. But considering the problem statement says to provide relevant cells, probably all buildings need to be checked as they might have heights greater than Notre-Dame's.\n\nI think the appropriate approach is to include each building's name and height because it's necessary to compare all of them against Notre-Dame's to determine if she's still the tallest. So I'll list all rows with \"name\" and \"height m/ft\".\n\nBut in reality, only 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is taller. So maybe just that one? Or perhaps others as well.\n\nWait, no, because even if a building was tallest in the past but not now, like Tour de la Bourse until 1992, its height is still lower than 1000's.\n\nNo, Tour de la Bourse has a higher height (194m) than Notre-Dame (69m), so it's taller. So technically, if any building (including Tour de la Bourse or Sun Life Building) is taller than Notre-Dame, the claim is false.\n\nSo perhaps all rows except Notre-Dame are relevant because their heights might be greater. But in this case, multiple buildings have higher heights, but only one is still the current tallest.\n\nBut for the purposes of the task, perhaps we should include each row's \"name\" and \"height m/ft\" as they need to be checked against the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all rows' name and height.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Notre-Dame Basilica remains the tallest building is false. The 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re tower holds the title of the tallest building with a height of 205 meters. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The task is to determine if Notre-Dame Basilica is still the tallest structure based on provided data.\n2. **Analyze the Data:** Each row in the table lists a building's name and its height in meters.\n3. **Compare Heights:** Check each building's height against Notre-Dame Basilica's 69-meter height.\n4. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Any building with a greater height than 69 meters is a candidate for being taller.\n5. **Determine the Tallest Structure:** The 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re tower, standing at 205 meters, is identified as the tallest.\n6. **Conclude the Claim's Validity:** Since another structure (1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re) is taller, the claim is false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim that Notre-Dame Basilica remains the tallest structure is incorrect. The 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re tower is the tallest with a height of 205 meters. Therefore, the relevant cells include each building's name and its recorded height.\n\nAnswer: [False]",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"tour cibc hold the record for the most year be the tallest in montreal.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see what each column represents. The relevant columns here are \"name,\" \"years as tallest,\" \"of years as tallest,\" and \"height m / ft.\" But the claim is about the number of years they held the record for being the tallest in Montreal.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to focus on the row where the name is \"tour cibc.\" Let's find that. Scanning through the rows: notre dame basilica, royal bank building, sun life building, tour cibc, etc. Got it, tour cibc is the fourth row.\n\nNow, for \"tour cibc,\" the years as tallest are listed as 1962 with a note of <1 year. The \"of years as tallest\" column says \"<1 year.\" So they only held the record for less than a year before losing it or whatever happened. \n\nThe claim states that tour cibc holds the record for the most years. But according to the table, their tenure was less than one year. If another building had a longer period as the tallest, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at other buildings: for example, place ville marie has 2 years, tour de la bourse has 28 years, and 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re has 21 years current. So none of them have more than the 99 years that notre dame basilica had, but tour cibc only held it for less than a year.\n\nWait, no, the tallest record isn't necessarily about holding it continuously. But the claim is specifically about how long they held the record. If they only held it for <1 year, then they don't have the most years. The longest time in the table is notre dame basilica with 99 years.\n\nSo the claim that tour cibc holds the record is false because their tenure was less than one year.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"place ville marie be the tallest building for the least amount of year.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two specific things: being the tallest building and having been built for the least amount of years. So, I should look at the table provided and check these aspects for \"place ville marie.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different building with various attributes like street address, years as tallest, number of floors, etc. The relevant columns for the claim are likely \"height m / ft\" (which I assume is height) and \"of years as tallest,\" which probably refers to how many years it was the tallest building.\n\nStarting with the first part: being the tallest building. From the table, \"place ville marie\" has a height of 188 meters, which converts to approximately 617 feet. I'll compare this with other buildings in the list to see if it's indeed the tallest.\n\nChecking each row:\n\n- notre dame basilica: 69m/226ft\n- royal bank building: 121m/397ft\n- sun life building: 122m/400ft\n- tour cibc: 187m/614ft\n- place ville marie: 188m/617ft\n- tour de la bourse: 194m/637ft\n- 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re: 205m/673ft\n\nSo, \"place ville marie\" is the second tallest building in terms of height. The tallest is \"tour de la bourse\" with 194 meters. Therefore, it's not the tallest; it's the second tallest.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says it was built for the least amount of years. Looking at the \"of years as tallest\" column:\n\n- notre dame basilica: 99 years\n- royal bank building: 3 years\n- sun life building: 31 years\n- tour cibc: <1 year (which is less than a year)\n- place ville marie: 2 years\n- tour de la bourse: 28 years\n- 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years\n\nWait, \"tour cibc\" has <1 year. So that's the least amount of years as tallest. But the claim is about \"place ville marie.\" So, placeville has 2 years, which is more than tour cibc but less than others.\n\nBut the claim says \"the least amount of year,\" so it's referring to the building that was tallest for the shortest time. Tour cibc holds that record with <1 year.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions \"place ville marie\" as being the tallest for the least years. But in reality, placeville is not the tallest; tour de la bourse is taller. So the first part of the claim is false because it's not the tallest building.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misinterpret the columns. Let me double-check the table headers:\n\n- \"years as tallest\": that's the years it was the tallest.\n- \"of years as tallest\": perhaps how many years since it became the tallest? Or is it the duration it held the title?\n\nFor example, notre dame basilica was tallest from 1829-1928, which is 99 years. So, \"years as tallest\" for each building is the range during which it was the tallest.\n\nPlaceville's entry is 1962-1964, so that's 2 years as tallest. Tour cibc is only <1 year, so it didn't hold the title long at all.\n\nSo, tour cibc is the least amount of years as tallest. Placeville is next with 2 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim says placeville is the tallest for the least years. But in reality:\n\n1. It's not the tallest building.\n2. Tour cibc was tallest for <1 year, which is less than placeville's 2 years.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect on both counts: it's not the tallest, and another building had a shorter time as tallest.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE because the claim is incorrect in both aspects.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because \"place ville marie\" isn't the tallest building, nor did it hold that title for the least amount of years compared to other buildings like \"tour cibc.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for the same amount of time as the notre dame basilica.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part of this claim means and check it against the data in the table.\n\nStarting with the Notre-Dame Basilica. Looking at the table, the relevant columns are \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\". From the table, Notre-Dame Basilica was the tallest building from 1829 to 1928, which is a total of 99 years. So that's one part established.\n\nNow, looking at the Sun Life Building. It says it remains the tallest for the same amount of time. The relevant columns here would be similar: \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\". According to the table, the Sun Life Building was the tallest from 1931 to 1962. That's a duration of 31 years.\n\nWait, that doesn't match the 99 years of the Notre-Dame Basilica. So already, there seems to be a discrepancy here. The claim is saying they lasted for the same amount of time, but the numbers don't add up.\n\nBut I should double-check my calculations. Let me count again: from 1931 to 1962 inclusive. That's 31 years (including both start and end years). For Notre-Dame, it's from 1829 to 1928, which is indeed a longer period\u201499 years.\n\nSo based on the table data, the durations are different. The claim states that they lasted for the same amount of time, but according to the numbers in the table, it's not true.\n\nI don't think I've missed any other details here.
