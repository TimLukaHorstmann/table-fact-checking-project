    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim about Graham McKenzie is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Graham McKenzie played in 60 matches in his career, from 1961 to 1971.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find Graham McKenzie's row. Scanning through the names, I see \"graham mckenzie\" is one of the entries. Let me check which row that is.\n\nLooking at the first column, \"name,\" I find the fifth entry: \"graham mckenzie.\" Now, I need to verify each part of the claim against this row's data.\n\nThe career span in the claim is from 1961 to 1971. In the table, under the \"career\" column for Graham McKenzie, it says \"1961 - 1971.\" That matches exactly, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, the number of matches he played: the claim states 60. Looking at the \"matches\" column for Graham McKenzie, I see the value is 60. So that also aligns perfectly.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in other columns that would affect these numbers. For instance, overs and maidens are about bowling stats but since the claim is about matches played, those aren't directly relevant here.\n\nSo both parts of the claim\u2014career duration and number of matches\u2014are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"matches\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"career\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination. The claim in question is: \"glenn mcgrath participate in 4874.4 over during the course of his cricket career.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions Glenn McGrath participating in 4874.4 overs. Looking at the table, each row represents a player with various statistics. I should focus on the row for Glenn McGrath to find relevant data.\n\nIn the table, under the \"career\" column, it says his career span is from 1993 - 2007. That seems to align with the time frame mentioned in the claim, so that's a point to consider.\n\nNext, looking at the columns related to overs: \"overs\", \"matches\", etc. The \"matches\" column for McGrath shows 124 matches. Each match typically involves two innings (unless it's a limited overs game where each innings is counted separately). So, if we're talking about overs bowled in all his matches, it might be close to the total number of overs he has to offer.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions 4874.4 overs. Looking at the table, under \"overs\", the value for McGrath is indeed 4874.4. That's a direct match. So that seems accurate.\n\nI should also check other columns like \"matches\" and see if it makes sense. He played 124 matches, which is quite a few, so the total overs bowled of around 4874.4 seems reasonable given the number of matches he played over his career.\n\nAre there any conflicting pieces of information? For example, if the claim had said something about maidens or wickets, but since it's specifically about overs, we don't need to consider those unless they affect the total overs bowled. But as per the table, 4874.4 is correct for his overs.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim that Glenn McGrath participated in 4874.4 overs during his career is supported by the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Brett Lee is true based on the table provided. Let me start by reading the claim again: \"brett lee have a best score of 5 / 30 , with 547 maiden in 2755.1 over\". \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need to be checked against the table. The table has several columns related to a player's career: name, career span, matches, overs, maidens, runs, wickets, average, best, 5w (five-wicket hauls), and 10w (ten-wicket hauls). \n\nThe claim mentions two specific numbers from Brett Lee's stats. The first part is about the \"best score\" being 5/30. In cricket terminology, the \"best score\" typically refers to the highest number of wickets taken in an innings without finishing as a five-wicket or ten-wicket haul. However, looking at the table, I don't see a column named \"best\". The closest columns are \"average\", which is 30.82 for Brett Lee, and \"5w\" and \"10w\", which are 10 and 0 respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps \"best score\" refers to the number of maidens (overs without scoring). The table has a \"maidens\" column. For Brett Lee, it's listed as 547. So maybe the claim is referring to maidens instead of wickets? Or perhaps it's mixing terms.\n\nThe second part of the claim says \"with 547 maiden in 2755.1 over.\" Again, looking at the table, Brett Lee has 547 maidens and his matches total 76 with overs adding up to 2755.1. So that seems correct.\n\nBut the first part of the claim mentions \"best score of 5/30\". The table doesn't have a direct column for this. However, in the \"best\" column, Brett Lee's entry is \"5 / 30\". Wait, yes, looking at row 4 (Brett Lee), the \"best\" column says \"5 / 30\". So that part matches.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n- Name: Brett Lee, so we need to look at his row.\n- Career: From 1999-2010, but the table has it as 1999 - 2010, which seems correct.\n- Best score: 5/30. The \"best\" column for Brett Lee is indeed \"5 / 30\".\n- Maidens: 547, which matches.\n- Overs: The total overs he bowled would be the sum of all his overs in each match. However, the table lists \"overs\" as a single number, but I think it's the total overs bowled, which should match with the total number of matches and maidens. Since maidens + wickets = overs. Wait, no, actually, overs is the total deliveries bowled, which would be the sum of all over in each match.\n\nWait, looking back, each player has a \"matches\" column, but for Brett Lee, it's 76 matches, with a total of 2755.1 overs bowled. The maidens are 547, so if we calculate, 547 + (wickets * runs) would equal the total overs, but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nHowever, in the table, each player has their own \"overs\" column as a single number, which is likely the total overs bowled across all matches. So for Brett Lee, the \"overs\" column is 2755.1, and maidens are 547. So the claim says he has 547 maidens in 2755.1 overs, which aligns with the table.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. His best score is indeed 5/30, and he has 547 maidens across 2755.1 overs. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"best\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"maidens\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the best score of 7 / 83 be for the career year of 1971 - 1984.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The term \"best score\" refers to the bowler's performance metrics. In the table, each row has a column named \"best,\" which shows their best bowling figures. For example, Shane Warne's best is 8/71, Glenn McGrath's is 8/24, and so on.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific score of \"7 / 83.\" I'll look through the \"best\" column to see if any bowler has this exact figure during their career. \n\nLooking at each row:\n- shane warne: best is 8/71\n- glenn mcgrath: 8/24\n- dennis lillee: 7/83\n- brett lee: 5/30\n- craig mcdermott: 8/97\n- jason gillespie: 7/37\n- richie benaud: 7/72\n- graham mckenzie: 8/71\n- ray lindwall: 7/38\n- clarrie grimmett: 7/40\n- merv hughes: 8/87\n- stuart macgill: 8/108\n- mitchell johnson: 8/61\n\nI see that Dennis Lillee has the best score of 7/83. Now, I need to check if this bowler's career years match the claim's range of 1971 - 1984.\n\nLooking at the \"career\" column for Dennis Lillee: it says 1971 - 1984. That matches exactly with the year range in the claim.\n\nSo, the claim is stating that the best score of 7/83 belongs to a bowler whose career was from 1971 to 1984, which aligns perfectly with Dennis Lillee's data in the table. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all parts are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if any bowler has a best score of \"7 / 83\" and whether their career spans from 1971 to 1984.\n\n- **Dennis Lillee** has a best score of \"7 / 83\" and his career is from **1971 - 1984**.\n  \nThis matches the claim exactly, confirming it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"best\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"career\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"1961 - 1971 be the career duration for 60 matches and the average be less than 26.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. Career duration from 1961 to 1971: This should correspond to a player's career start and end years as 1961-1971.\n\n2. The number of matches is 60: So I need to look for a row where the 'career' column equals 1961 - 1971 and the 'matches' column is exactly 60.\n\n3. The average should be less than 26: So in that same row, the 'average' column value must be below 26.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find the relevant data.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Shane Warne (1992-2007) \u2013 Doesn't match career years.\n- Row 1: Glenn McGrath (1993-2007) \u2013 Not matching.\n- Row 2: Dennis Lillee (1971-1984) \u2013 Career is earlier than 1961, so no.\n- Row 3: Brett Lee (1999-2010) \u2013 Not matching.\n- Row 4: Craig McDerrott \u2013 No match.\n- Row 5: Jason Gillespie \u2013 No.\n- Row 6: Richie Benaud \u2013 No.\n- Row 7: Graham McKenzie \u2013 Career from 1961-1971. Let's check his matches and average.\n\nGraham McKenzie:\n- Career: 1961 - 1971\n- Matches: 60 (matches column shows 60)\n- Average: 29.79\n\nSo, the average here is 29.79, which is higher than 26. Therefore, it doesn't satisfy the second condition of the claim.\n\nNext, checking others just in case:\n\n- Row 8: Ray Lindwall \u2013 Career ends in 1960, not 1971.\n- Row 9: Clarrie Grimmett \u2013 Career ends earlier.\n- Row 10: Merv Hughes \u2013 No match.\n- Row 11: Stuart MacGill \u2013 No.\n- Row 12: Mitchell Johnson \u2013 Career started later.\n\nSo, only Graham McKenzie's row matches the career duration and number of matches, but his average is higher than 26. Therefore, the claim that both conditions are met is false because the average isn't less than 26.\n\nI don't see any other rows matching the career duration of 1961-1971 with exactly 60 matches. Only Graham McKenzie does, but he doesn't meet the average condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"career\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"average\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the person with the career 1946 - 1960 be in 61 match and have 2727.2 over and 6704 run.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The person has a career spanning from 1946 to 1960. They played 61 matches, had 2727.2 overs, and scored 6704 runs.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the name's career is between 1946 and 1960. Scanning through each row:\n\n- shane warne: 1992 - 2007 \u2192 Not matching.\n- glenn mcgrath: 1993 - 2007 \u2192 No.\n- dennis lillee: 1971 - 1984 \u2192 Before 1946, so no.\n- brett lee: 1999 - 2010 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- craig mcdermott: 1984 - 1996 \u2192 No.\n- jason gillespie: 1996 - 2006 \u2192 No.\n- richie benaud: 1952 - 1964 \u2192 This is close, but not exactly 1946-1960. Maybe? Wait, 1952-1964 includes part of the 1940s and the 60s.\n- graham mckenzie: 1961 - 1971 \u2192 Partially overlaps with 1960, so maybe not a full 1946-1960 career.\n- ray lindwall: 1946 - 1960 \u2192 Yes! This matches exactly.\n\nSo Ray Lindwall is the person in question. Now check his stats:\n\nLooking at his row:\n- career: 1946 - 1960 \u2192 Matches.\n- matches: 61 \u2192 Correct, as per the claim.\n- overs: 1970.2 \u2192 Wait, but the claim says 2727.2 overs. That doesn't match. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the table, Ray Lindwall has \"overs\" as 1970.2. But the claim mentions 2727.2 overs. So this doesn't add up.\n\nHold on, maybe I misread. Let me check each cell again for Ray Lindwall:\n\n- career: 1946 - 1960 \u2705\n- matches: 61 \u2705\n- overs: 1970.2 \u2192 The claim says 2727.2. That's different.\n- runs: 5251, but the claim mentions 6704. So that doesn't match either.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong column for overs. Let me check the table structure again.\n\nThe columns are:\nname, career, matches, overs, maidens, runs, wickets, average, best, 5w, 10w.\n\nSo \"overs\" is indeed the third column after matches. For Ray Lindwall, it's 1970.2 overs. The claim says 2727.2, which doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, his runs are 5251, not 6704 as per the claim.\n\nThis discrepancy means that while the career and number of matches do match, the overs and runs don't. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because those two stats don't align with Ray Lindwall's actual numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct row. Let me double-check which player has a career ending in 1960.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n- richie benaud: 1952 - 1964 \u2192 His career started before 1946 but ended in 1964.\n- ray lindwall: 1946 - 1960 \u2192 Career starts and ends within the claimed period.\n\nSo Ray Lindwall is the correct player. But as I saw, his overs are 1970.2, not 2727.2, which is way higher.\n\nSimilarly, runs are 5251, so that's a big difference from 6704.\n\nThis means that two of the three stats in the claim don't match Ray Lindwall's actual numbers. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the person with a career from 1946 to 1960 played 61 matches and had 2727.2 overs and 6704 runs. Checking the table:\n\n- Ray Lindwall has the correct career (1946-1960) and 61 matches but incorrect overs (1970.2 instead of 2727.2) and runs (5251 instead of 6704).\n\nThus, the claim is false because two key stats are inaccurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the person who be in the second highest number of match have 17995 run and 708 wicket.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two specific statistics: runs (17995) and wickets (708). These should belong to the player with the second highest number of matches.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player's career details. The columns relevant here are \"matches,\" \"runs,\" and \"wickets.\" \n\nI need to find out which players have the second highest number of matches because that's the starting point. So I'll look through the \"matches\" column. Let me list them out:\n\n1. shane warne: 145\n2. glenn mcgrath: 124\n3. dennis lillee: 70\n4. brett lee: 76\n5. craig mcdermott: 71\n6. jason gillespie: 71\n7. richie benaud: 63\n8. graham mckenzie: 60\n9. ray lindwall: 61\n10. clarrie grimmett: 37\n11. merv hughes: 53\n12. stuart macgill: 44\n13. mitchell johnson: 50\n\nNow, I need to find the second highest number of matches. The highest is Shane Warne with 145, so the next one would be Glenn McGrath with 124 matches.\n\nSo the claim refers to the player in the second position (Glenn McGrath) having 17995 runs and 708 wickets. Let's check his stats from the table.\n\nLooking at Glenn McGrath's row:\n- Runs: 12186\n- Wickets: 563\n\nWait, that doesn't match the numbers in the claim. The claim says 17995 runs and 708 wickets, but McGrath has only 12,186 runs and 563 wickets. \n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I misinterpreted the second highest? Let me double-check.\n\nShane Warne: 145\nGlenn McGrath:124\nBrett Lee:76\nCraig Mcdermott:71\nJason Gillespie:71\n\nWait, are there any others with 71? Yes, Craig and Jason both have 71. So the second highest is 124 by Glenn, but if the table's matches column isn't ordered beyond that, then perhaps the second highest after Shane is 124.\n\nBut regardless, even if it's the second, his stats don't match the claim. So the numbers in the claim (17995 runs and 708 wickets) are much higher than what any player has achieved. The only person close to that is Shane Warne with 17,995 runs and 708 wickets.\n\nWait a minute! Shane Warne has exactly those numbers: 17995 runs and 708 wickets. But the claim says it's the person who is in the second highest number of matches. So if the second highest is Glenn McGrath, but the stats belong to Shane Warne, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to Shane being the one with the highest matches, so perhaps the claim has a typo or misunderstanding. But according to the exact wording, it's about the person in second highest matches having those stats. Since that doesn't align with any player except possibly Shane if someone else has the same number of matches as him, but Shane is first.\n\nSo I think the claim is incorrect because the numbers don't match the second highest matches count. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a player with the second highest number of matches having 17995 runs and 708 wickets. However, upon checking, Glenn McGrath has 124 matches, which is the second highest, but his stats don't match the claim. Shane Warne, who has the highest number of matches, actually holds those records.

To find who has the highest average, I need to look at the 'average' column and compare all players' averages. \n\nI'll list out the averages from the table:\n\n1. shane warne: 25.42\n2. glenn mcgrath: 21.64\n3. dennis lillee: 23.92\n4. brett lee: 30.82\n5. craig mcdermott: 28.63\n6. jason gillespie: 26.14\n7. richie benaud: 27.03\n8. graham mckenzie: 29.79\n9. ray lindwall: 23.03\n10. clarrie grimmett: 24.22\n11. merv hughes: 28.38\n12. stuart macgill: 29.02\n13. mitchell johnson: 30.64\n\nNow, identifying the highest average(s). The highest is Mitchell Johnson with 30.64, followed by Brett Lee and Stuart MacGill with 30.82 and 29.02 respectively.\n\nNext, I need to check how many matches each of these top performers has. \n\n- Mitchell Johnson: matches = 50\n- Brett Lee: matches = 76\n- Stuart MacGill: matches = 44\n\nThe claim states that \"the person with the highest average have 44 match.\" Now, considering the players:\n\n1. Mitchell Johnson has the highest average (30.64) and his matches are 50.\n2. Brett Lee also has a high average but more matches than 44.\n3. Stuart MacGill has an average of 29.02 and exactly 44 matches.\n\nThe claim says \"the person\" with the highest average, which would likely refer to Mitchell Johnson. However, Mitchell's matches are 50, not 44. So if the claim is about the person(s) with the highest average having 44 matches, it might be incorrect because Mitchell has 50. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to Stuart MacGill as the one with 44 matches and a high average. However, Stuart's average is lower than Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson, so he isn't the highest.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the person\" which implies singular. If it's referring to the highest average, that would be Mitchell Johnson, but his matches are 50, not 44. Therefore, the claim is false because the person with the highest average does not have 44 matches.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is interpreted as any of the top performers having 44 matches, then Stuart MacGill has exactly 44 and a decent average. But the wording \"the person\" suggests it's referring to the highest, which would be Mitchell Johnson, making the claim false.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the claim is FALSE because the highest average player does not have 44 matches.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"matches\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
