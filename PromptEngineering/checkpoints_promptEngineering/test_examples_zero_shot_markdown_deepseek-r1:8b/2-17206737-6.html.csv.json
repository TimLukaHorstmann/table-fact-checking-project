    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this decision.\n\nThe claim says: \"the montreal canadiens be the visitor on december 27, 29, and 30.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each date mentioned in the claim and check if the Montreal Canadiens are listed as visitors for those dates. \n\nStarting with December 27: Looking through the table row by row, I find that December 27 is indeed a row where the home team is Pittsburgh Penguins. The visitor on this date is Montreal Canadiens, so that's one match.\n\nNext, December 29: Scanning the table again, on December 29, the home team is Florida Panthers, and the visitor is again Montreal Canadiens. That's another match.\n\nThen, December 30: This date also appears in the table, with the home team being Tampa Bay Lightning, and the visitor is Montreal Canadiens once more.\n\nSo all three dates (27th, 29th, and 30th) have Montreal Canadiens as the visitor. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. Each date corresponds to a specific row in the table. The columns involved are 'date', 'visitor', etc., but since we're only focusing on the 'visitor' column for these dates, each relevant cell would be where the visitor is Montreal Canadiens on those days.\n\nSo for December 27: row index is 10 (since it's the 11th row if starting from zero, but I need to check how the rows are indexed). Wait, let me count. The first row is december 2 as row 0, then each subsequent date increments by one. So December 27 would be row 10, because 27th is the 4th row in the second week? Wait no, let's see:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: dec 2\n\n1: dec4\n\n2: dec6\n\n3: dec9\n\n4: dec11\n\n5: dec13\n\n6: dec16\n\n7: dec18\n\n8: dec20\n\n9: dec21\n\n10: dec27\n\n11: dec29\n\n12: dec30\n\nSo yes, December 27 is row index 10. The relevant column for this date is 'visitor', so we'll note that.\n\nSimilarly, December 29 is row 11, and the relevant column is also 'visitor'.\n\nDecember 30 is row 12, same as above.\n\nSo all three dates have their 'visitor' cell where Montreal Canadiens are listed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with these three cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"21273 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific number, 21273, which from the table seems to be the attendance figure. It says that this crowd size attended 9 games. So I need to check how many times the attendance is exactly 21273 and if that count equals 9.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, and points. The relevant column here is \"attendance,\" which directly shows the number of people who attended each game.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. december 2: attendance is 21273.\n2. december 4: attendance is 21273.\n3. december 6: attendance is 21273.\n4. december 9: attendance is 21273.\n5. december 11: attendance is 21273.\n6. december 13: attendance is 21273.\n7. december 16: attendance is 16434 (different from 21273).\n8. december 18: attendance is 21273.\n9. december 20: attendance is 21273.\n10. december 21: attendance is 21273.\n11. december 27: attendance is 17132 (different).\n12. december 29: attendance is 20741 (different).\n13. december 30: attendance is 20454 (different).\n\nNow, let's count how many times attendance is 21273:\n\n- Rows 0 to 3: 1,2,3,4 \u2192 that's four games.\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 13. Let me recount each row's attendance:\n\nRow 0: 21273\nRow 1: 21273\nRow 2: 21273\nRow 3: 21273\nRow 4: 21273\nRow 5: 21273\nRow 6: 16434 (no)\nRow 7: 21273\nRow 8: 21273\nRow 9: 21273\nRow 10: 21273\nRows 11-13: different.\n\nWait, that's more than nine. Let me count each row's attendance:\n\n0: yes\n1: yes\n2: yes\n3: yes (four games so far)\n4: yes (five)\n5: yes (six)\n6: no\n7: yes (seven)\n8: yes (eight)\n9: yes (nine)\n10: yes (ten)\n\nOh, wait, row 10 is December 21, and the attendance is 21273. So that's the tenth game with 21273 attendees.\n\nSo the number of games where attendance was 21273 is more than nine\u2014it's actually ten. Therefore, the claim says \"9 of the game,\" but it's actually ten. That would make the claim FALSE because it's not exactly nine games, but ten.\n\nWait, let me double-check to avoid a mistake. Let me list out each row and note if attendance is 21273:\n\n- Row 0: yes\n- Row1: yes (2)\n- Row2: yes (3)\n- Row3: yes (4)\n- Row4: yes (5)\n- Row5: yes (6)\n- Row7: yes (7)\n- Row8: yes (8)\n- Row9: yes (9)\n- Row10: yes (10)\n\nYes, that's ten games where attendance was 21273. So the claim says nine, but it's actually ten. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the attendance of 21,273 was present for 9 games. Upon examining the table, there are 10 instances where the attendance was exactly 21,273. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the montreal canadiens be the home team at least 5 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about the Montreal Canadiens being the home team at least five times. So I need to look for instances where the home team is listed as the Montreal Canadiens and count how many such occurrences there are in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, and points. The 'home' column seems to be directly related to who is playing as the home team for each game listed.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one to see if the home team is the Montreal Canadiens.\n\n1. **December 2**: Home team is Montreal Canadiens.\n2. **December 4**: Same here, they are the home team.\n3. **December 6**: Again, it's Montreal Canadiens hosting.\n4. **December 9**: Yep, same home team.\n5. **December 11**: Montreal Canadiens again.\n6. **December 13**: They are the home team once more.\n7. **December 16**: Wait, this one is against Carolina Hurricanes, so not the Canadiens as home.\n8. **December 18**: Home team is still them.\n9. **December 20**: Hosting again.\n10. **December 21**: Opponent is Carolina, so they are visitors; Canadiens are home? No, because visitor is Carolina, so home must be the other team, which in this case is not Montreal. Wait, no\u2014wait, the 'visitor' column lists who is coming to play, and the 'home' column shows their opponent. So if the home column says \"montreal canadiens\", then they are the home team.\n\nWait, let me clarify: For each row, the 'visitor' is the team that's visiting another team, which is the 'home'. So for example, in December 2, visitor is Atlanta Thrashers, so home is Montreal Canadiens. Similarly, on December 4, the visitor is NY Rangers, home is Montreal.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- December 21: Visitor is Carolina Hurricanes, so home is someone else (Montreal? No, because the opponent would be listed as the home team). Wait, in this row, 'visitor' is Carolina, 'home' is Montreal Canadien. So yes, they are home here.\n\nWait no\u2014December 21: The row shows:\n\n| date        | visitor             | score    | home                | decision   |   attendance | record     |   points |\n|:------------|:--------------------|:---------|:--------------------|:-----------|-------------:|:-----------|---------:|\n| december 21 | carolina hurricanes | 3 - 2 ot | montreal canadiens  | price      |        21273 | 18 - 9 - 6 |       42 |\n\nSo here, the home team is Montreal Canadiens. So that's another game where they are at home.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- December 27: Home vs Pittsburgh Penguins, so yes, Canadiens are home.\n- December 29: Home against Florida Panthers, so again, Canadiens as home.\n- December 30: Visitor is Tampa Bay Lightning, and the 'home' column says \"tampa bay lightning\", wait no\u2014wait, in this row:\n\n| december 30 | montreal canadiens  | 2 - 1 so | tampa bay lightning | price      |        20454 | 21 - 9 - 6 |       48 |\n\nSo here, the home team is Tampa Bay Lightning, because the visitor is Montreal Canadiens. So in this case, they are visitors, not home.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So on December 30th, the home team is Tampa Bay Lightning, and the visitor is Montreal Canadiens. Therefore, the Canadiens are not the home team here.\n\nSo let me recount:\n\nRows where 'home' is \"montreal canadiens\":\n\n- Dec 2: yes\n- Dec 4: yes\n- Dec 6: yes\n- Dec 9: yes\n- Dec 11: yes\n- Dec 13: yes\n- Dec 18: yes\n- Dec 20: yes\n- Dec 21: yes\n- Dec 27: yes\n- Dec 29: yes\n\nWait, that's 11 games where they are home. But let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the 'home' column:\n\nRow 0: Montreal Canadiens (Dec 2)\nRow1: same\nRow2: same\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: opponent is Carolina, so no.\nRow7: same as home\nRow8: visitor is Philly Flyers, so home is Canadiens? Wait no\u2014wait, in row 7:\n\n| december 18 | philadelphia flyers | 2 - 5    | montreal canadiens  | halak      |        21273 | 17 - 9 - 5 |       39 |\n\nSo yes, they are home here.\n\nRow8: Dec20: Home vs Sabres\nRow9: Dec21: Home vs Carolina\nRow10: Dec27: Home vs Penguins\nRow11: Dec29: Home vs Florida\nRow12: Dec30: Visitor, so not home.\n\nWait, so from row 0 to row12 (assuming indexing starts at 0), how many times are they home?\n\nLooking at each row's 'home' column:\n\nRow 0: Canadiens (Dec2)\nRow1: same\nRow2: same\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: Carolina, so no.\nRow7: same\nRow8: same\nRow9: same\nRow10: same\nRow11: same\nRow12: Tampa Bay\n\nSo that's 11 times where they are home.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014rows 0-11 would be Dec2 to Dec29, with row12 being Dec30. So from Dec2 to Dec29, how many times are they at home?\n\nEach time the 'home' is Montreal Canadiens:\n\nLet me list all rows and mark if home:\n\nRow0: yes (Dec2)\nRow1: yes (4)\nRow2: yes (6)\nRow3: yes (9)\nRow4: yes (11)\nRow5: yes (13)\nRow6: no (16)\nRow7: yes (18)\nRow8: yes (20)\nRow9: yes (21)\nRow10: yes (27)\nRow11: yes (29)\nRow12: no (30)\n\nSo that's 11 games where they are home.\n\nWait, but from Dec2 to Dec29 is about a month, so 28 days. So perhaps there could be multiple games a week.\n\nBut in any case, the task is to count how many times they were home, i.e., 'home' is \"montreal canadiens\".\n\nEach time that column is them, that's a home game.\n\nSo total of 11 times.\n\nWait, but let me list all rows:\n\nRows (assuming each row is a game):\n\nRow0: Canadiens home\nRow1: same\nRow2: same\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: opponent, not home\nRow7: same as above\nRow8: same\nRow9: same\nRow10: same\nRow11: same\nRow12: not home\n\nWait no, in row 6 (Dec16), 'home' is Carolina, so Canadiens are visitors.\n\nSo in total:\n\n- Dec2: yes\n- Dec4: yes\n- Dec6: yes\n- Dec9: yes\n- Dec11: yes\n- Dec13: yes\n- Dec18: yes\n- Dec20: yes\n- Dec21: yes\n- Dec27: yes\n- Dec29: yes\n\nThat's 11 games.\n\nSo the answer is they have at least 11 home games.\n\nWait, but let me check each row again to be precise:\n\nList all rows with 'home' as \"montreal canadiens\":\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n1. Dec2 - Home\n2. Dec4 - Home\n3. Dec6 - Home\n4. Dec9 - Home\n5. Dec11 - Home\n6. Dec13 - Home\n7. Dec16: Home is Carolina, so Canadiens are visitors.\n8. Dec18: Home\n9. Dec20: Home\n10. Dec21: Home\n11. Dec27: Home\n12. Dec29: Home\n13. Dec30: Visitor\n\nSo that's 11 games where they are home.\n\nThus, the answer is \\boxed{11}.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine how many times the Montreal Canadiens played as the home team during a specific period. By examining each row of data provided, we identified the dates and games where the Canadiens were listed as the home team. \n\nAfter careful analysis, it was found that the Montreal Canadiens played at home on 11 separate occasions. Each time the 'home' column in the table indicates \"montreal canadiens\", it represents a game where they were hosting another team.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{11}",

The claim says: \"less than 21273 crowd be in attendance for only 4 of the game.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to say that there were fewer than 21,273 attendees at four games. So I need to check each row of the table to see how many times the attendance was less than 21,273.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"attendance\" column has numbers like 21273 and other lower numbers. For each game, I should note if the attendance is less than 21,273 and count how many such instances there are.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. December 2: attendance 21273 \u2192 equal, not less.\n2. December 4: same as above.\n3. December 6: same.\n4. December 9: same.\n5. December 11: same.\n6. December 13: same.\n7. December 16: attendance is 16434, which is less than 21273. So that's one game.\n8. December 18: same as above, so another one.\n9. December 20: same, third one.\n10. December 21: same, fourth one.\n11. December 27: 17132 \u2192 fifth one.\n12. December 29: 20741 \u2192 sixth one.\n13. December 30: 20454 \u2192 seventh one.\n\nWait, that's seven games where attendance is less than 21273, not four. So the claim says only four games had attendance below 21,273, but in reality, there are more. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should check which columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"crowd be in attendance,\" so that's the \"attendance\" column. I need to look at each row where the attendance is less than 21273 and note their row indices and the column name.\n\nSo the rows with less attendance are:\n\n- Row 6 (index 6, attendance 16434)\n- Row 7 (index 7, attendance 17132)\n- Row 8 (index 8, attendance 20741)\n- Row 9 (index 9, attendance 20454)\nWait, wait. Let me count again:\n\nRow indices start at 0.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 6: index is 6.\nRow 7: index 7.\nRow 8: index 8.\nRow 9: index 9? Wait, the table has 13 rows, right? Let me count each row's index correctly. \n\nThe first row is December 2: index 0.\n\nThen:\n\n- Dec 16: row 6 (index 6)\n- Dec 18: row 7\n- Dec 20: row 8\n- Dec 21: row 9\n- Dec 27: row 10\n- Dec 29: row 11\n- Dec 30: row 12\n\nSo the rows with attendance less than 21273 are 6,7,8,9,10,11,12. That's seven rows, not four.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are these seven.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the philadelphia flyer be the home team at least 5 times.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is asking. It's about the Philadelphia Flyers being the home team five or more times in the games listed.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should check each row to see if there are instances where the Philadelphia Flyers are playing as the home team.\n\nThe columns relevant here are \"visitor\" and \"home\". The visitor is the away team, so the home team would be in the \"home\" column. I need to look for rows where the home team is \"philadelphia flyers.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. December 2: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. Not Flyers.\n2. December 4: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n3. December 6: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n4. December 9: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n5. December 11: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n6. December 13: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n7. December 16: Home team is Carolina Hurricanes. No.\n8. December 18: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n9. December 20: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n10. December 21: Home team is Montreal Canadiens. No.\n11. December 27: Home team is Pittsburgh Penguins. No.\n12. December 29: Home team is Florida Panthers. No.\n13. December 30: Home team is Tampa Bay Lightning. No.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I recall seeing the Flyers in some of these games. Let me check again more carefully.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 7 (index 6): December 16 vs Carolina Hurricanes. Home team is Carolina.\n- Row 8 (index 7): December 18: Home team is Montreal Canadiens.\nWait, actually, looking back, maybe I missed some rows.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each game with the home team:\n\nLooking at the table again, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning row indices. Let me recount the rows properly, starting from index 0 to 13.\n\nLet me list all rows with their indices and home teams:\n\nRow 0: December 2 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 1: December 4 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 2: December 6 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 3: December 9 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 4: December 11 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 5: December 13 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 6: December 16 - Home: Carolina Hurricanes\nRow 7: December 18 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 8: December 20 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 9: December 21 - Home: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 10: December 27 - Home: Pittsburgh Penguins\nRow 11: December 29 - Home: Florida Panthers\nRow 12: December 30 - Home: Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nWait, so in none of these rows is the home team Philadelphia Flyers. That suggests that the Flyers are not playing as the home team at all in this table.\n\nBut I think I might have missed a row because sometimes teams play multiple times, especially in the same season.\n\nLooking again, perhaps row 7 (index 6) is December 16: Carolina Hurricanes vs Montreal Canadiens. So Flyers aren't home here.\n\nRow 8: December 20 - Home: Montreal Canadiens. No.\n\nWait, but let me check if any game has Philadelphia Flyers as home team. Looking at the 'home' column:\n\nLooking for \"philadelphia flyers\" in the home column. Let's go through each row's home team:\n\n- All the home teams are either Montreal Canadiens, Carolina Hurricanes, Pittsburgh Penguins, Florida Panthers, or Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nNo entry shows Philadelphia Flyers as home.\n\nWait, but I might have misread some of the rows. For example, row 12 is December 30: Home is Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nSo in all the games listed,Philadelphia Flyers are never the home team. Therefore, they didn't play at home five times.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the philadelphia flyer be the home team at least 5 time\" would be FALSE because there are zero instances where they were the home team in this table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"16434 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's saying that there was an attendance figure of 16,434 at 9 different games. So, my task is to check if the table has nine rows where the \"attendance\" column equals 16434.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with various details like date, visitor team, score, home team, decision, attendance, record, and points. The key here is the \"attendance\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check the \"attendance\" value. Starting from the first row:\n\n1. December 2: Attendance is 21,273 \u2013 not 16,434.\n2. December 4: 21,273 again, so no.\n3. December 6: Same attendance of 21,273.\n4. December 9: 16,634? Wait, looking closely, it's 16434 here. That's one game.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Yes, for December 16th, the home team is Carolina Hurricanes and the attendance is 16,434. So that's one game.\n\n5. December 11: Attendance is 21,273 \u2013 nope.\n6. December 13: Same as before, 21,273.\n7. December 16: That's where I found the 16434. So that's one game.\n8. December 18: Back to 21,273.\n9. December 20: 21,273 again.\n10. December 21: 21,273 once more.\n11. December 27: Attendance is 17,132 \u2013 not matching.\n12. December 29: 20,741 \u2013 nope.\n13. December 30: 20,454 \u2013 also not.\n\nWait a minute, so I only found one game where attendance was 16,434. That's on December 16th against the Carolina Hurricanes with home team and decision by halak. The claim says \"9 of the game,\" which implies there should be nine games with that specific attendance number.\n\nBut in the table, after checking each row, I only see one instance where attendance is 16434. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported as there are only nine games if we consider all entries, but actually, only one game meets the attendance criteria.\n\nSo, this means the claim is FALSE because it's stating that 16,434 was in attendance for nine games, but according to the table, only one game matches that number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were nine games with an attendance of 16,434. Upon reviewing each row, only one game on December 16th had this exact attendance. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "over 40 point be score for at least 3 of the game",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"over 40 point be score for at least 3 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that there are at least three games where the home team scored over 40 points. So, I need to check each row in the table and see if the home team's score is greater than 40 for at least three of them.\n\nLooking at the table columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, points. The relevant column here is \"score\" for the home team and the total points they scored. Wait, no\u2014the claim mentions \"over 40 point be score,\" which I think refers to the home team's score being over 40 points. So I need to focus on the \"home\" team's score.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the table structure again. The columns are: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, points. The \"score\" column seems to represent the result of the game, like goals or points. For example, rows have scores like 4-5, which I assume is the visitor's score minus the home team's, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the \"points\" column is the total points, and the \"score\" column is something else.\n\nWait, looking at the first row: date is december 2, visitor is atlanta thrashers, score is 4-5, home is montreal canadiens. The \"score\" here might be indicating that the visitor scored 4 and home scored 5? Or maybe it's a different format. Then there's a \"points\" column which for this row is 32.\n\nHmm, so perhaps \"score\" refers to the game's result, like goals or points, but \"points\" is another column. Wait, in some rows, like december 2, score is 4-5 and points are 32. December 6: score is 2-1 ot (which probably means an overtime win) and points are 35.\n\nWait, maybe the \"score\" is actually the home team's score and the visitor's score. For example, on december 2, the home team scored 5, the visitor scored 4, so the home won 5-4? Then the points column might be something else, like total points in the game or perhaps some other metric.\n\nBut the claim is about \"over 40 point be score for at least 3 of the game.\" So I think it's referring to the home team scoring over 40 points. Therefore, I need to look at the home team's score and see if it's above 40 in three or more games.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\nRow 0: home is montreal canadiens, score is 4-5 (visitor). So home scored 5? Or maybe 5 points.\n\nRow 1: home again is montreal, score is 2-6, so home scored 2.\n\nRow 2: same team, score 2-1 ot. Home scored 2.\n\nRow3: calgary as home, score 1-4, so home scored 1.\n\nRow4: tampa bay away, score 3-1, home scored 3.\n\nRow5: washington capitals away, score 2-1, home scored 2.\n\nRow6: montreal vs carolina, home (canadiens) scored 2.\n\nRow7: philadelphia as visitor, score 2-5, so home scored 5.\n\nRow8: buffalo as visitor, score 3-4 ot. Home scored 4.\n\nRow9: carolina as visitor, score 3-2 ot. Home scored 2.\n\nRow10: montreal hosts pittsburgh, score 3-2. So home scored 3.\n\nRow11: same team, vs florida, score 5-2. Home scored 5.\n\nRow12: same team, vs tampa bay in a shootout, score 2-1 so. So home scored 2.\n\nWait, but looking at the \"score\" column, it's not clear whether these are points or goals. Alternatively, perhaps the \"points\" column is the total points for the game, and the \"score\" is something else. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"score\" refers to the home team's score, so in row 0: visitor scored 4, home scored 5, so home scored 5 points. In that case, looking for home scores over 40.\n\nWait, but looking at all rows:\n\nRow0: home score 5\n\nRow1: home score 2\n\nRow2: home score 2\n\nRow3: home score 1\n\nRow4: home score 3\n\nRow5: home score 2\n\nRow6: home (canadiens) score 2 against carolina, total points 37.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up \"score\" and \"points.\" Let me check the table again. Each row has:\n\n- date\n- visitor\n- score\n- home\n- decision\n- attendance\n- record\n- points\n\nSo for example, in Row0: date=12/2, visitor=atlanta thrashers, score=4-5, home=montreal canadiens, decision=price, etc.\n\nSo the \"score\" is 4-5. So that might mean the visitor scored 4 and the home scored 5. Then, the \"points\" column is 32.\n\nWait, so in Row0: visitor scored 4, home scored 5, total points 32. So maybe \"points\" refers to something else, like goals or total points in the game. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"score\" is indicating that the home team won by a score of (home - visitor). For example, if the score is 4-5, then home scored 4 and visitor 5? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nBut given that in Row0: points are 32, which is higher than previous games, perhaps \"points\" refers to something else, like total points accumulated by the home team during the game or something else entirely. It's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"score\" is not directly the home team's score but an identifier for the outcome, and the \"points\" column is something like points in a standings, which would be cumulative and not per game.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Maybe the \"points\" column is their overall league points, not per game. So each row represents a game, with the home team, the score of the game (visitor vs home), then other info like decision by whom, attendance, record after the game, and total points (probably in the standings).\n\nSo for example, in Row0: after the game, montreal canadiens have 32 points. So we'd need to see how their points changed each game.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the \"score\" column is not directly related to their points but rather the result of the game (visitor score - home score or something else).\n\nIf that's the case, then the claim about \"over 40 point be score\" doesn't make much sense because the points are cumulative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue. The original might have been in another language and translated as \"scored over 40 points,\" meaning goals or points per game.\n\nBut without more context, I'm unsure.\n\nWait, let's think differently: perhaps the \"score\" refers to goals scored by each team. So in Row0, visitor scored 4, home scored 5. Then, \"points\" could be total goals in the game (4+5=9), but that doesn't match with points being 32.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"score\" is a term used differently here, like man of the match or something else.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I think the intended meaning is that the home team scored over 40 points in three games. So we need to look for rows where the home team's score was greater than 40.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- The home teams are montreal canadiens (several times), calgary, tampa bay, washington capitals, pittsburgh, and florida panthers.\n\nLooking at their scores when they were home:\n\nRow0: home=montreal, score=5\n\nRow1: home=montreal, score=2\n\nRow2: home=montreal, score=2\n\nRow3: home=caglary, score=1\n\nRow4: home=tampa bay, score=3 (but wait, no, in row4: the home is carolina? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait no, Row4: date=12/9, visitor=carolina hurricanes, so home is washington capitals. No, wait:\n\nWait, perhaps I got the rows wrong. Let me list them properly with indexes.\n\nRow0: date 12/2, visitor atlanta, home montreal\n\nRow1: date 12/3, visitor buffalo, home montreal\n\nRow2: date 12/4, visitor calgary, home montreal\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me check the initial table:\n\nAssuming it's 12 games with each row representing a game.\n\nBut without the exact structure, perhaps I should list each row as:\n\n1. Game 1: dec 2 \u2013 atlanta (visitor) vs montreal (home)\n2. Game 2: dec 3 \u2013 buffalo (v) vs montreal (h)\n3. Game3: dec4 \u2013 calgary(v) vs montreal(h)\n4. Dec5 \u2013 carolina(v) vs washington(h)\n5. Dec6 \u2013 pittsburgh(v) vs montreal(h)\n6. Dec7 \u2013 florida(v) vs montreal(h)\n7. Dec8 \u2013 tampa(v) vs washington(h)\n8. Dec9 \u2013 buffalo(v) vs calgary(h)\n9. Dec10 \u2013 carolina(v) vs montreal(h)\n10. Dec11 \u2013 pittsburgh(v) vs washington(h)\n11. Dec12 \u2013 florida(v) vs montreal(h)\n12. Dec13 \u2013 tampa(v) vs montreal(h)\n\nWait, this is just a guess based on the names.\n\nBut regardless of that, for each home team, their score as home:\n\nGame1: h=montreal, score=5-4? Or 5 points?\n\nWait, in Game1, visitor scored 4, home scored5. So if \"score\" is (home - visitor), then it's 1. But that doesn't make sense for points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"score\" refers to the total points in the game by the home team, which would be 5 if they scored 5 goals and visitors scored 4.\n\nBut then points in hockey are usually tallies per goal, so a score of 5-4 would mean home scored 5, away scored 4.\n\nIf that's the case, then \"scored over 40 points\" would mean they scored more than 40 points in a game. But since each game is like 5-4 or similar, that doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's about cumulative points after the game. So for each row, we have to see if the home team has 40+ points after that game.\n\nBut looking at that, starting from zero:\n\nAfter Game1: montreal has 32 pts (from Row0)\n\nWait, but in the data given, each row ends with a number, which might be their total points. So perhaps for each game, we can track their cumulative points.\n\nSo if the task is to find out how many times the home team scored over 40 points after a game, then we need to see in each row whether the home team's points are above 40.\n\nBut without tracking all games sequentially, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe it's about the scoreline (home goals - away goals) being over 40, which is impossible because scores don't go that high in a single game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"scored over 40 points\" refers to something else entirely, like combined goals in all games they played, but that doesn't make much sense either.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the intended meaning is that in three separate games, the home team scored more than 40 goals. But given hockey games rarely have such high scores, it's highly unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"scored over 40 points\" means they won by a score of over 40 points, which again is impossible because goal margins don't exceed single digits in most sports.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the task is to determine how many times the home team scored more than 40 points in a game, but it's unclear. Alternatively, it might be about total points accumulated after three games.\n\nBut without clear instructions, I think the best approach is to consider that \"scored over 40 points\" refers to their cumulative points after each game and count how many times their total exceeded 40.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nAssuming each row's last number is their total points after that game.\n\nSo we need to track each home team's points after each game they hosted.\n\nLet's list the games with home team, date, visitor, and points:\n\n1. montreal (h) vs atlanta (v): After this game, montreal has 32 points.\n2. montreal (h) vs buffalo (v): After this game, montreal has 31 points.\n3. montreal (h) vs calgary (v): After this game, montreal has 30 points.\n4. washington (h) vs carolina (v): After this game, washington has 40 points.\n5. montreal (h) vs pittsburgh (v): After this game, montreal has 29 points.\n6. montreal (h) vs florida (v): After this game, montreal has 28 points.\n7. washington (h) vs tampa (v): After this game, washington has 39 points.\n8. calgary (h) vs buffalo (v): After this game, calgary has 35 points.\n9. montreal (h) vs carolina (v): After this game, montreal has 27 points.\n10. washington (h) vs pittsburgh (v): After this game, washington has 38 points.\n11. montreal (h) vs florida (v): After this game, montreal has 26 points.\n12. montreal (h) vs tampa (v): After this game, montreal has 25 points.\n\nNow, looking for when the home team's total points exceed 40:\n\nFrom the list above:\n\n- Washington reached 40 points in Game4 and then had 39 and 38 afterward, but never exceeded 40 again.\n- Calgary reached 35, which is below 40.\n- Montreal stayed lower than 30.\n\nSo only in Game4 did a home team (washington) reach 40 points. Therefore, they scored over 40 points once.\n\nBut wait, if we consider cumulative points after each game:\n\nIf we track each home team's total points after each of their games:\n\nMontreal played multiple games at home:\n\nGame1: 32\n\nGame2:31\n\nGame3:30\n\nGame5:29\n\nGame9:27\n\nGame11:26\n\nGame12:25\n\nSo Montreal never reached over 40.\n\nWashington played three times at home:\n\nGame4:40\n\nGame7:39\n\nGame10:38\n\nSo only in Game4 did they reach 40, but not exceed. So no home team ever had more than 40 points after a game.\n\nCalgary only reached 35.\n\nTherefore, the answer is zero times.\n\nBut wait, if \"over 40\" means strictly above, then none. If it's equal to or above, then Washington once.\n\nBut since the question says \"scored over 40 points,\" which usually implies more than. So only one time: when Washington reached exactly 40.\n\nAlternatively, if they meant something else, but given the data, that's how it is.\n</think>\n\nThe home team's total points after each game never exceeded 40. Therefore, there were no instances where they scored over 40 points in a single game.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{0}",

That's just one game, right? But the claim says \"only 4 of the games,\" so this doesn't match up.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in reading the table. Let me double-check each row's attendance:\n\nRow 0: 21,273 \u2013 no\nRow 1: same \u2013 no\nRow 2: same \u2013 no\nRow3: same \u2013 no\nRow4: same \u2013 no\nRow5: same \u2013 no\nRow6: 16,434 \u2013 yes (1)\nRow7: 21k \u2013 no\nRow8: 21k \u2013 no\nRow9: same \u2013 no\nRow10: same \u2013 no\nRow11: 17,132 \u2013 equals, so no.\nRow12: 20,741 \u2013 no\nRow13: 20,454 \u2013 no.\n\nSo only one game meets the attendance condition. The claim says \"only 4,\" which is not correct. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that only one game had an attendance less than 17,132. Since the claim states there were four such games, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim states: \"over 40 point be score for at least 5 game.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Breaking it down:\n\n1. **\"over 40 point be score\":** This likely refers to a team's score being over 40 points in a game.\n2. **\"for at least 5 game\":** This implies that there should be at least five games where the team scored over 40 points.\n\nSo, my goal is to check each game (each row) in the table and see if the home or visitor team had a score over 40 in at least five of those games.\n\nLooking at the table columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, points. The relevant columns here are 'visitor' and 'home' scores. Each game has two teams, so each row represents one game with their respective scores.\n\nI'll go through each row and note which team scored over 40.\n\n- **December 2:** Atlanta Thrashers vs Montreal Canadiens. Scores: 4 - 5 (Away) and presumably the home score is 5? Wait, no\u2014looking at the 'score' column for December 2, it's 4 - 5. That means one team scored 4, the other 5. Neither is over 40.\n- **December 4:** NY Rangers vs Montreal Canadiens: 2 - 6. Neither score is over 40.\n- **December 6:** NJ Devils vs Montreal Canadiens: 2 - 1 (OT). Again, low scores.\n- **December 9:** Calgary Flames vs Montreal Canadiens: 1 - 4. Not over 40.\n- **December 11:** Tampa Bay Lightning vs Montreal Canadiens: 3 - 1. Still low.\n- **December 13:** Washington Capitals vs Montreal Canadiens: 2 - 1. No.\n- **December 16:** Montreal Canadiens (away) vs Carolina Hurricanes: 2 - 3. Not over 40.\n- **December 18:** Philadelphia Flyers vs Montreal Canadiens: 2 - 5. Visitor scored 2, home scored 5.\n- **December 20:** Buffalo Sabres vs Montreal Canadiens: 3 - 4 (OT). No.\n- **December 21:** Carolina Hurricanes vs Montreal Canadiens: 3 - 2 (OT). Neither over 40.\n- **December 27:** Montreal Canadiens (away) vs Pittsburgh Penguins: 3 - 2. Visitor scored 3, home scored 2.\n- **December 29:** Montreal Canadiens (away) vs Florida Panthers: 5 - 2. Home scored 5, away scored 2.\n- **December 30:** Montreal Canadiens (away) vs Tampa Bay Lightning: 2 - 1 (SO). Visitor scored 2, home scored 1.\n\nWait a minute\u2014I just realized something. The 'score' column shows the result as \"4 - 5\" etc., but I think that's the final score of the game. So for each row, both teams have a score. For example, on December 2, the visitor (Atlanta) scored 4, and the home team (Montreal) scored 5.\n\nSo to check if any team had over 40 points in a game, I need to see if either the 'visitor' or 'home' scores are greater than 40 for each game.\n\nLooking at all games:\n\n- December 2: Both teams scored 4 and 5. Neither is over 40.\n- December 4: 2 - 6. Visitor 2, home 6. Home team's score is 6.\n- December 6: 2 - 1 OT. Scores 2 and 1.\n- December 9: 1 - 4. Scores 1 and 4.\n- December 11: 3 - 1. Scores 3 and 1.\n- December 13: 2 - 1. Scores 2 and 1.\n- December 16: Away team scored 2, home scored 3.\n- December 18: Visitor scored 2, home scored 5.\n- December 20: Visitor scored 3, home scored 4.\n- December 21:Visitor scored 3, home scored 2.\n- December 27: Visitor scored 3, home scored 2.\n- December 29: Visitor scored 5, home scored 2. Wait, the 'score' column for December 29 is 5 - 2. So the away team (Montreal) scored 5, and the home team (Florida) scored 2.\n- December 30: Visitor scored 2, home scored 1.\n\nWait, so the highest any team scored in a single game was 6 points on December 4 (home team) and 5 points elsewhere. None of these are over 40. That seems odd because hockey games usually don't have such high scores. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'score' column?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'points' column is different from the 'score' column. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The 'score' column shows something like \"4 - 5\" which seems to be the game result.\n- The 'record' and 'points' columns are separate, showing the team's overall points after each game.\n\nSo the 'points' column refers to their total points in the league or standings, not the game score. So for example, after December 2, Montreal Canadiens have a record of 14 - 6 - 4 and 32 points.\n\nThus, the 'score' column is indeed the game result, not the point total. Therefore, no team scored over 40 in any game.\n\nSo, none of the games had a team scoring more than 5 goals. That's not possible because even NHL games don't usually end with single-digit scores.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the 'score' column. Let me check again.\n\nFor example, December 2: \"4 - 5\". Maybe this is the score after overtime or something else? Or perhaps it's in goals for and against?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'score' column isn't the game result but something else, like goal difference or something. But given the context, it's more likely the game result.\n\nWait, no\u2014the 'record' is a separate column, so I think the 'score' must be the game score.\n\nTherefore, in all these games, the highest any team scored was 6 (December 4: home team scored 6? Wait December 4: \"2 - 6\". So visitor scored 2, home scored 6. Oh! So on December 4, the home team scored 6, which is higher than others but still not over 40.\n\nBut in real life, hockey games can have high scores, but in this context, maybe the numbers are different because it's a simulation or a different sport.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014maybe these aren't hockey scores. Maybe it's a soccer game or another sport where lower scores are more common. For example, in soccer, 2-6 would be unusual; usually, the scores are closer, but 6 is still high for soccer.\n\nBut regardless of the sport, the point is that none of the teams scored over 40 points in any single game. Therefore, there's no instance where a team scored over 40 goals (or points, depending on the sport).\n\nThus, the task requires checking if any team scored over 40 in any game. Since they didn't, the answer would be that no team did.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the 'score' column as the total points rather than per-game. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at December 2: record is 14-6-4 (wins, losses, ties), and points are 32. So it's cumulative. The 'score' for that game was 4-5.\n\nSimilarly, on December 4: they have a higher point total of 36 after the game, which suggests that the previous day they had 32.\n\nSo yes, the 'score' is per game, and none exceed single-digit.\n\nTherefore, no team scored over 40 in any game. So the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nNo team scored more than 40 points in any game during the period evaluated.\n\n**Answer:** No team scored over 40 points in any of the games.",
