    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with different nations and their medal counts in the Olympics. The claim says that Germany has 0 golds but 5 silvers. I need to check if that's true based on the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Germany in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see Germany is at rank 7. So, row index 7. Now, checking the columns: gold, silver, bronze, and total. The claim specifically mentions gold and silver, so I need to check those two columns for Germany.\n\nLooking at the 'gold' column for Germany, it's 0. That matches what the claim says. Now, checking the 'silver' column for Germany, it has 5. So that also matches. \n\nI should make sure there are no other relevant cells needed. The bronze and total aren't mentioned in the claim, so I don't need to check those. Therefore, only the gold and silver columns are relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be for row 7 (Germany's row) and both 'gold' and 'silver' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
