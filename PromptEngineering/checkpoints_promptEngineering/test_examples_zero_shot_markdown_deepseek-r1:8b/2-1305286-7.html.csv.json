    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and understand its structure. The table has columns: year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result. Each row represents a different award or nomination from what looks like an animated movie-related category.\n\nI need to focus on the specific claim about Susan Sarandon. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Susan Sarandon** is the person in question.\n2. She should be either the winner or a nominee.\n3. The event happened in 2001.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find entries from 2001. \n\n- Row with year 1997: Not relevant because it's about an actress, but not Susan.\n- Row with year 1999: Not relevant.\n- Year 2001: Here we go. The category is \"favorite voice from an animated movie,\" the film is \"rugrats in paris : the movie,\" and the winner/nominee is listed as Susan Sarandon. The result is \"won.\"\n\nSo, in 2001, Susan Sarandon won in the category of favorite voice from an animated movie for \"rugrats in paris.\" \n\nNow, checking if she was a nominee or the winner: The table says \"won,\" so she wasn't just nominated but actually won.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim states that Susan Sarandon was either a nominee or a winner in 2001. Since she won, the claim is supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. The year 2001 corresponds to row_index 2 (since it's zero-indexed as per the example). The column involved is \"winner / nominee (s).\" So, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 2, Column: winner / nominee(s)\n\nThus, the JSON should reflect this.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "bruce willis be nominate for the film rugrats go wild",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking against the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"bruce willis be nominate for the film rugrats go wild.\" So, I'm looking for information in the table related to Bruce Willis being nominated for \"Rugrats Go Wild.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table and see if any match both the film title and the person's name mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with 2004: The year is 2004, category is favorite voice from an animated movie. Film is Rugrats Go Wild, winner/nominee is Bruce Willis. So this row directly mentions that Bruce Willis was nominated for that film. That seems relevant to the claim.\n\nLooking through other rows:\n- 1997: Harriet the Spy, Rosie O'Donnell - not relevant.\n- 1999: The Rugrats Movie, N/A - no.\n- 2001: Rugrats in Paris, Susan Sarandon - different person.\n- 2005: Lemon Snicket's..., Jim Carrey - different.\n- 2007: Charlotte's Web, Dakota Fanning - same year but different film and person.\n- 2012: Rango, Johnny Depp - different.\n\nSo only the 2004 row is relevant. The claim refers to Bruce Willis being nominated for Rugrats Go Wild, which matches exactly with that row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking against the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the winner / nominee (s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor be rosie o'donnell.\" So the claim is about the year 2007, category \"favorite movie actor,\" and the winner or nominee being Rosie O'Donnell.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result. I need to find the relevant cells that correspond to the claim.\n\nSo, for 2007, I should look at the rows where the year is 2007. Let's check:\n\n- The first row with year 2007 is when the category is \"favorite movie actress,\" film is \"charlotte's web,\" and winner is Dakota Fanning.\n- The second row is also for 2007 but the category is \"favorite movie actor\" with film \"nacho libre\" and winner Jack Black.\n\nWait, no, looking again, actually, the table has two entries for 2007. Let me count the rows:\n\nRow 0: 1997\nRow 1: 1999\nRow 2: 2001\nRow 3: 2004\nRow 4: 2005\nRow 5: 2007 (movie actress)\nRow 6: 2007 (movie actor)\nRow 7: 2012\n\nSo, in row 6, the year is 2007, category is \"favorite movie actor,\" film is \"nacho libre,\" and the winner is Jack Black. The claim says Rosie O'Donnell, which doesn't match this.\n\nIn row 5, it's the same year but a different category (actress) with Dakota Fanning as the winner, so that's not relevant either.\n\nSo, in both cases for 2007, the winner is Jack Black for the actor category and Dakota Fanning for the actress. Rosie O'Donnell isn't listed here.\n\nLooking back at the table, I should check if there's any row where year is 2007, category is \"favorite movie actor,\" and the winner is Rosie O'Donnell. From what I see, there isn't such a row. The closest is Jack Black for that category in 2007.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Rosie O'Donnell isn't the winner or nominee for the 2007 favorite movie actor category. She was the winner in 1997 for the actress category, as shown in row 0.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE and the relevant cells are the ones from row 6 (year 2007, category \"favorite movie actor\").\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Rosie O'Donnell isn't listed as a winner or nominee for the 2007 favorite movie actor category. The correct winner in that category was Jack Black.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result. Each row represents a specific award or nomination for a particular year.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate.\" So I need to find the entry in the table where the year is 1999, the category is \"favorite movie,\" and then check what the result was.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first row has year 1997, category \"favorite movie actress.\"\n- Next, the second row is for 1999. Let me focus on that.\n- For 1999, the category is \"favorite movie.\" The film listed is \"the rugrats movie.\"\n- The winner/nominee(s) column says \"n / a,\" which I assume means no award or it's not applicable.\n- The result column for this row is marked as \"won.\"\n\nWait, so the claim says that in 1999, the favorite movie was nominated. But according to the table, it actually won. So the result was \"won\" and not \"nominated.\" That would mean the claim is false.\n\nBut I should make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Let me check each relevant cell.\n\nThe relevant cells for the claim are:\n1. The row where year = 1999.\n2. The column for category = \"favorite movie.\"\n3. The result column to see what it was.\n\nIn the table, for 1999:\n- Year: 1999\n- Category: favorite movie\n- Film: the rugrats movie\n- Result: won\n\nSo the claim says it was nominated, but it was actually won.
