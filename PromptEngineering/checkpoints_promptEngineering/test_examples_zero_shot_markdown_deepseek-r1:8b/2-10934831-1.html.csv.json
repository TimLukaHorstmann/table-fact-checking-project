Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts: \n1. The warning sign has a red border.\n2. The warning sign has black text.\n\nI'll need to check both aspects in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six types of signs with various attributes. Let me go through each row and see which ones could potentially be the warning sign.\n\nThe first row is about the warning sign:\n- Type: warning\n- Shape: triangular\n- Border: red\n- Background colour: yellow\n- Text/symbol: black\n\nSo, this directly mentions that a warning sign has a red border and black text. That seems to support the claim for both parts.\n\nWait, but I should check all other rows just in case there's another type of sign also named 'warning' or if it's referring to the same thing. However, looking at the table, only the first row is labeled as warning, so that's the only one to consider for this claim.\n\nNow, verifying the two parts:\n- Red border: From the first row, yes, the border is red.\n- Black text: Yes, the text/symbol column says black for the warning sign.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are fully supported by the table data.

The claim says, \"the warning sign has a yellow background colour and a triangular shape.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: \n1. Yellow background color.\n2. Triangular shape.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several types of signs listed with their respective attributes. Each row corresponds to a type of sign and describes its shape, border, background color, and text or symbol.\n\nLet me go through each relevant column in the table:\n\n- **Background colour**: This is under the \"background colour\" column.\n- **Shape**: This is under the \"shape\" column.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to the warning sign. So, I'll focus on the row where the type of sign is \"warning.\"\n\nIn the table:\n- The first row is about the warning sign with a triangular shape, red border, yellow background, and black text or symbol.\n\nSo, for the warning sign, both conditions in the claim are met:\n- Background color: yellow.\n- Shape: triangular.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.

The claim is: \"the warning and prohibition sign both have a red border.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about two signs: warning and prohibition. Both are supposed to have a red border according to the claim. So I need to look at each of these signs in the table and check their border colors.\n\nLooking at the table columns, there's \"type of sign,\" \"shape,\" \"border,\" and so on. The relevant column here is \"border\" because that's what the claim is about. \n\nNow, let me find where the warning and prohibition signs are in the table. Scanning through the row headers: warning, prohibition, mandatory instructions, supplementary, directions, sometimes, information. So warning is the first one, row index 0, and prohibition is second, row index 1.\n\nNext, I need to check what their borders are. For the warning sign (row 0), the border is red. That matches the claim because the claim says they both have a red border. \n\nFor the prohibition sign (row 1), the border is also red according to the table. So both signs have a red border, which means the claim is true.\n\nI should also note down which cells are relevant. For warning, it's row 0 and column \"border.\" For prohibition, it's row 1 and the same column. \n\nSo putting it all together: the claim is TRUE because both warning and prohibition signs have a red border as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because both the warning and prohibition signs have a red border according to the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"border\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"border\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim in question is: \"the mandatory instruction sign have a blue background.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find the relevant information about the mandatory instruction sign. Let's see, the table has several types of signs: warning, prohibition, mandatory instructions, supplementary, directions sometimes, and information.\n\nLooking for \"mandatory instructions\" in the first column. Yes, that's row 3. Now, I need to check what each cell says for this row. The columns are type of sign, shape, border, background colour, text/symbol.\n\nSo, for mandatory instructions, the type is circular, shape is circular, border is white, background color is blue, and text/symbol is white. \n\nThe claim says that the background color is blue. According to the table, the background color for mandatory instructions is indeed blue. So this should make the claim true.\n\nI need to map which cells are relevant. The row index for mandatory instructions is 3 (since it's the fourth item in the list). The columns involved are \"background colour.\" So I'll select that cell.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include the background color from row 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"background colour\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"blue be the background color of the white border for the mandatory instruction sign.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It's making two claims here: one about the background color and another about the border color. Specifically, it says that blue is the background color and white is the border color for a specific sign type.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different type of sign with various attributes. The columns are: type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that check these parts. So, first, I should identify what \"mandatory instruction sign\" refers to in the table. Scanning through the table, I see a row where \"type of sign\" is \"mandatory instructions.\" That's row 2 (since it starts at 0).\n\nSo, for row 2: \n- border is white\n- background colour is blue\n\nNow, checking the claim:\n1. Background color: The claim says blue is the background color, which matches with what's in the table.\n2. Border color: The claim also states that the border is white, which again aligns with the table.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true based on the \"mandatory instructions\" sign's attributes. \n\nNext, I need to list the relevant cells.

So, for background colour and border, their respective columns in row 2.\n\nSo, relevant_cells would include the row index (which is 2) and the column names \"background colour\" and \"border.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as both the background color and border of the mandatory instruction sign match the given information.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about the warning sign is correct based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"the warning sign be circular with a red border and black text.\" So, they're talking about three aspects here: shape, border color, and text color.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant information for each part of the claim. The table has several signs listed with their respective attributes like type, shape, border, background color, and text/symbol.\n\nStarting with the shape: the claim says it's circular. So I should look through the table to see which signs have a circular shape. From the table, the prohibition sign is circular, the mandatory instructions are also circular, supplementary is rectangular, directions sometimes is rectangular, and information is rectangular. Wait, so only prohibition and mandatory instructions are circular? Let me double-check: yes, row 2 is prohibition with circular shape, row 3 is mandatory instructions, also circular. So both of these have circular shapes.\n\nNext, the border color is red. Looking at the table, I see that warning has a red border, prohibition also has red, mandatory instructions have white, supplementary has white red, directions sometimes black, information white. So the warning and prohibition signs have red borders. That's two signs with red borders.\n\nNow, the text or symbol: the claim says it's black. Looking at the table, the warning sign has black text, prohibition also has black text, mandatory instructions have white, supplementary white black, directions sometimes black, information white. So multiple signs have black text, including warning and prohibition, as well as directions sometimes.\n\nBut wait, the claim is specifically about a \"warning\" sign. So even though other signs might fit some of these attributes, we need to focus on the warning sign itself. Let me check row 0: type is warning, shape triangular, border red, background yellow, text black. So the warning sign is triangular, has a red border, and black text.\n\nNow, let's compare this with the claim. The claim says it's circular. But the warning sign isn't circular; it's triangular. That's already a discrepancy. So even though other signs like prohibition or mandatory have circular shapes, the warning does not. Therefore, the shape part of the claim is incorrect for the warning sign.\n\nSo, to verify each condition in the claim against the table:\n\n1. Shape: The claim says circular, but the warning sign is triangular. Relevant cell is row 0, column \"shape.\"\n2. Border: The claim mentions red border, which matches for the warning sign (row 0, border).\n3. Text: The claim states black text, which also matches (row 0, text).\n\nBut since the shape is incorrect, the overall statement about the warning sign being circular is false. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nSo, even though some other signs meet two of the three criteria in the claim, for the specific warning sign, only border and text match, but shape doesn't. Hence, the claim is not fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the warning sign being circular is incorrect because it's triangular. The relevant cells show that the shape doesn't match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"shape\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"border\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"text / symbol\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the warning sign be triangular in shape with a yellow background and white text.\" So, breaking it down, there are three aspects to verify:\n\n1. **Shape**: The claim mentions the warning sign is triangular.\n2. **Background colour**: It states the background is yellow.\n3. **Text/symbol**: The text or symbol should be white.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row in the table where the type of sign is \"warning.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that the first row corresponds to the warning sign. So, row_index 0.\n\nNext, under the \"shape\" column for the warning sign, it's listed as triangular. That matches the claim's first part.\n\nNow, checking the background colour. The table shows that the warning sign has a yellow background. This aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nLastly, the text/symbol should be white. According to the table, the warning sign has black text or symbol. Hmm, this is a discrepancy because the claim says \"white text,\" but the table states it's black. That means one of the conditions isn't met.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The claim says the text is white, but in the table, under 'warning', the text/symbol is black. So that doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through each row again. Row 0: type warning, shape triangular, border red, background yellow, text/black. Yes, it's black. So the claim is wrong here.\n\nTherefore, since one of the attributes (text/symbol) doesn't match, the entire claim isn't fully supported. But wait, the user might be considering only certain cells as relevant.\n\nWait, no, the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim. So I need to see if all the aspects of the claim are correctly stated in the corresponding row.\n\nSo for the warning sign:\n\n- Shape: triangular (matches)\n- Background colour: yellow (matches)\n- Text/symbol: black (doesn't match)\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims the text is white, but the table says black. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. The table for warning sign has 'text / symbol' as black.
