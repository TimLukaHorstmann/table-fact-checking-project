    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"On August 13th, 1966, the away team be north melbourne, while the home team be collingwood.\" So, it's stating that on a specific date, North Melbourne was the away team and Collingwood was the home team in some match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns are: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe date given in the claim is August 13th, 1966. I need to look for that exact date in the table. Scanning through the 'date' column, I see all entries are under \"13 august 1966\". Since the claim mentions August 13, but without the year, but the table shows the year as well. So it's important because August is a month and 13th is the day. The date in the table is exactly \"13 august 1966\", so that matches.\n\nNext, I need to check if North Melbourne was the away team on that day. Looking at the 'away team' column for the row with the date \"13 august 1966,\" let's see:\n\n- st kilda vs south melbourne\n- essendon vs fitzroy\n- collingwood vs north melbourne\n- carlton vs melbourne\n- richmond vs geelong\n- hawthorn vs footscray\n\nSo, for the date \"13 august 1966,\" there are six games listed. Specifically, in the third row (index 2), the away team is North Melbourne, and the home team is Collingwood.\n\nWait, but let me check each row's date to make sure I'm looking at the correct one. All rows except the first have \"13 august 1966\" as their date? No, actually, all the rows in the table are for games on that specific date. Wait, no, the 'date' column is the same across multiple rows. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, each row's date is \"13 august 1966,\" so it's possible that there were multiple games on that day. So I need to check which game had North Melbourne as the away team and Collingwood as the home team.\n\nLooking through the 'away team' column: \n\n- Row 0: South Melbourne\n- Row 1: Fitzroy\n- Row 2: North Melbourne (this is the third row)\n- Row 3: Melbourne\n- Row 4: Geelong\n- Row 5: Footscray\n\nSo, yes, in row index 2, the away team is North Melbourne. Now, what's the home team there? It's Collingwood.\n\nSo the claim says that on August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne and the home team was Collingwood. According to the table, this is exactly the case in row index 2.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm supposed to check if it's fully supported. So does this mean that the claim is TRUE? Because all parts of the claim match the relevant cells in the table.\n\nSo, the date matches, away team is North Melbourne, home team is Collingwood. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because on August 13th, 1966, the away team was indeed North Melbourne, and the home team was Collingwood.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
