    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"this person's lowest yearly earnings between 1998 and 2005 was 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that in the years from 1998 to 2005, the person's lowest yearly earnings were 0. So, I need to check if there are any instances where their earnings reached 0 in those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1998 onwards, and it includes several columns: year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, best finish, earnings, and money list rank. The key column here is \"earnings,\" so I'll focus on that.\n\nLet's examine each relevant year:\n\n1. **1998**: Earnings are listed as 37221.\n2. **2000**: Earnings are 143248.\n3. **2001**: Earnings show a 0. Wait, this is for the year 2001.\n4. **2002**: Earnings are also 0.\n5. **2003**: Earnings are 0 again.\n6. **2004**: Earnings are 15858.\n7. **2005**: Earnings are 10547.\n\nSo, looking at each of these years from 1998 to 2005 (which includes 1998, 2000, and then every year up through 2005), the earnings in 2001, 2002, and 2003 are all 0. That means the person had years where their earnings were 0.\n\nNow, the claim says that the lowest yearly earnings between those years was 0. Since there are multiple instances of 0 earnings (specifically in 2001, 2002, and 2003), it seems that 0 is indeed the lowest value they achieved during that period.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if \"earnings\" is the correct column to be looking at for this claim. The claim mentions \"lowest yearly earnings,\" so yes, \"earnings\" is the relevant column here.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the person did have years where their earnings were 0 between 1998 and 2005. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each year's earnings between 1998 and 2005. The earnings for 2001, 2002, and 2003 are 0, confirming that the lowest yearly earnings were indeed 0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Casey Martin never win a tournament\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the table and what each column represents.\n\nLooking at the table columns: year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, best finish, earnings, money list rank. The claim is about Casey Martin's wins in tournaments. So I should focus on the \"wins\" column to see if he ever won any tournament.\n\nNow, let me go through each row of the table and check the \"wins\" cell for each year. \n\nStarting with 1998: 0 wins.\n2000: 0 wins.\n2001: 0 wins.\n2002: 0 wins.\n2003: 0 wins.\n2004: 0 wins.\n2005: 0 wins.\n\nIn all these years, Casey Martin didn't win any tournaments. So that would suggest the claim is true because he never won a tournament.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there's no other relevant information elsewhere. For example, the \"cuts made\" or \"best finish\" might provide additional context, but since the claim specifically mentions wins, I think focusing on that column is sufficient.\n\nSo based on the table provided, Casey Martin indeed never won a tournament. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the number of tournament play in 2000 be 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, best finish, earnings, and money list rank. Each row corresponds to a specific year from 1998 to 2005.\n\nThe claim is about the number of tournaments played in 2000. So, I need to find the relevant data for the year 2000.\n\nLooking at the table, under the year 2000 column, the entry is 29. That's the number of tournaments played in that year. The claim says it should be 2. Since 29 doesn't equal 2, this suggests the claim is false.\n\nNow, to verify this, I need to check which cells are relevant. The \"tournaments played\" column is where we get the number for each year. So, for 2000, the tournaments played cell is the one that matters. Therefore, the relevant_cells should include this specific row and column.\n\nSo, in summary, since the actual number of tournaments played in 2000 was 29, not 2, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournaments played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
