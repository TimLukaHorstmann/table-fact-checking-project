    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license , 2 of which run on window\"\n\nFirst, let me identify the key points in the claim:\n\n1. Corn is one of three emulators with a proprietary license.\n2. Out of these three, two run on Windows.\n\nSo I need to look at the table provided and check each part of this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that \"corn\" is listed as having a proprietary license. Let me confirm that. The row for corn has \"license\" as \"proprietary\", so yes, that's correct.\n\nNext, how many emulators with a proprietary license are there in total? Looking through the table:\n\n- Corn: Proprietary\n- UltrahLE: Proprietary\n\nWait, only two emulators have proprietary licenses. But the claim says \"1 of 3\". So this might be an issue because there are only two, not three.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing some. Let's list all emulators with proprietary licenses:\n\n- Corn: Proprietary\n- UltrahLE: Proprietary\n\nThat's it. Two emulators. So the claim says 1 of 3, which would be incorrect because there are only two.\n\nBut hold on, perhaps I should check if there are more. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. 1964: GPL v2\n2. 1964js: GPL v2\n3. cen64: BSD 3 - clause\n4. corn: Proprietary\n5. daedalusx64: GPL v2\n6. mupen64: GPL v2\n7. mupen64plus: GPL v2\n8. mupen64plus , android edition (ae): GPL v3\n9. n64js: Expat (which is a license, not proprietary)\n10. project64: GPL v2\n11. sixtyforce: Proprietary\n12. ultrahLE: Proprietary\n\nSo yes, only Corn and UltrahLE have proprietary licenses, that's two. The claim says 1 of 3, which would be incorrect.\n\nNow the second part: \"2 of which run on window.\" Let me check how many of these two (Corn and UltrahLE) run on Windows.\n\nLooking at their platforms:\n\n- Corn runs on Windows.\n- UltrahLE runs on Windows and Xbox.\n\nSo both Corn and UltrahLE run on Windows, making it 2 emulators that do so. The claim says 2, which is correct in this part.\n\nBut the first part of the claim is wrong because there are only two proprietary emulators, not three. So overall, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me check again. Does any other emulator have a proprietary license? No, all others are either GPL-based or BSD/Expat. So yes, only Corn and UltrahLE.\n\nSo the claim's first part is wrong, making the entire statement FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states there are three emulators with proprietary licenses when there are two. However, the second part about two running on Windows is correct.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows and columns:**\n   - The claim refers to \"corn\" and its license type, so row index 3 (row for Corn) and column \"license\".\n   - Additionally, check all rows to count the number of emulators with proprietary licenses.\n\n2. **Check licenses:**\n   - Only Corn and UltrahLE have proprietary licenses, totaling two, not three as claimed.\n\n3. **Platform check:**\n   - Both Corn and UltrahLE run on Windows.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim's first part is incorrect (should be 2 emulators), making the entire statement FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"there be 6 emulator release under the gpl v2 license , and only 1 release under the gpl v3 license.\" \n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table and check for the relevant columns that could verify this claim. The key columns seem to be 'license' because the claim is about different licenses.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Name: 1964\n- License: gpl v2\n\nSecond row:\n- Name: 1964js\n- License: gpl v2\n\nThird row:\n- Cen64\n- License: bsd 3 - clause (not relevant)\n\nFourth row:\n- Corn\n- License: proprietary (nope)\n\nFifth row:\n- Daedalusx64\n- License: gpl v2\n\nSixth row:\n- Mupen64\n- License: gpl v2\n\nSeventh row:\n- Mupen64plus\n- License: gpl v2\n\nEighth row:\n- Mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\n- License: gpl v3 (this is the only one under gpl v3)\n\nNinth row:\n- N64js\n- Expat license (not relevant to GPL versions)\n\nTenth row:\n- Project64\n- GPL v2\n\nEleventh row:\n- Sixtyforce\n- Proprietary\n\nTwelfth row:\n- Ultrahle\n- Proprietary\n\nNow, I need to count how many are under GPL v2 and GPL v3.\n\nCounting GPL v2 entries: 1964, 1964js, Daedalusx64, Mupen64, Mupen64plus, Project64. That's six in total.\n\nThen, looking for GPL v3: only the Android edition of Mupen64plus is listed as GPL v3.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"mupen64 runs 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant cells in the table related to Mupen64 and the number of platforms it supports.\n\nLooking through the table, I see several rows for Mupen64:\n- Mupen64: Version 0.5.1 supports Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS.\n- Mupen64plus: Version 2.0 supports Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD.\n- Mupen64plus Android Edition (ae): Supports Android.\n\nSo, let's count the platforms for each:\n\n1. **Mupen64**: 5 platforms - Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS.\n2. **Mupen64plus**: 4 platforms - Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD.\n3. **Mupen64plus Android Edition (ae)**: 1 platform - Android.\n\nSo the total platforms for Mupen64 is 5 when including all versions, but the claim refers to \"mupen64\" specifically, which in its main version supports 5 platforms. Now, I need to check if any other emulator in the table has fewer than this or exactly one less.\n\nLooking at other emulators:\n\n- **1964**: Windows, Xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n- **1964js**: JavaScript \u2192 1 platform.\n- **cen64**: Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux \u2192 3 platforms.\n- **corn**: Windows \u2192 1 platform.\n- **daedalusx64**: Windows, PSP \u2192 2 platforms.\n- **mupen64plus**: 4 platforms (already counted).\n- **n64js**: JavaScript \u2192 1 platform.\n- **project64**: Windows, Xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n- **sixtyforce**: OS X \u2192 1 platform.\n- **ultrahle**: Windows, Xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n\nWait, Mupen64 supports 5 platforms in its main version. Let me check if any other emulator has more than that.\n\nLooking through all the emulators listed, none seem to support more than 5 platforms. Most have fewer. For example, Mupen64plus Android only has 1 platform, but the main Mupen64 has 5. So does that mean it runs on one more platform than any other?\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" So Mupen64 supports 5 platforms, and others have less, like 4,3,2, etc. But wait, the main version of Mupen64 is 0.5.1 with 5 platforms, but Mupen64plus has 4 and Android adds another, making it 5 as well? Or does the claim refer to a specific edition?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\n- The main Mupen64 (version 0.5.1) supports 5 platforms: Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS.\n- Mupen64plus is another fork, version 2.0, which also supports 4 platforms: Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD.\n- The Android edition adds one more platform (Android), so Mupen64plus now has 5 platforms.\n\nSo the main Mupen64 already has 5 platforms. Now, are there any other emulators in the table that support as many or more?\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n1964: 2\n1964js:1\ncen64:3\ncorn:1\ndaedalusx64:2\nmupen64plus:4 (before Android)\nn64js:1\nproject64:2\nsixtyforce:1\nultrahle:2\n\nSo the highest number of platforms among other emulators is 4 (cen64 has 3, mupen64plus without Android has 4). So Mupen64's main version supports 5, which is more than any other emulator. Therefore, it runs on one more platform than any other.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" So if Mupen64 has 5 and others have less, then yes, it's 1 more than any other. But I need to make sure that no other emulator has as many or more platforms.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- The only other emulators with multiple platforms are cen64 (3), mupen64plus (4), and project64 and ultrahle which have 2 each, so no, none of them reach 5. So Mupen64 does support one more platform than any other emulator in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Mupen64 supports 5 platforms, which is more than any other emulator listed in the table. The relevant cells are from the \"system\" and \"license\" columns for Mupen64's main version.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"system\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim \"only 3 emulator run on both window and xbox\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim says there are only three emulators that can run on both Windows and Xbox platforms. So I should look for emulators in the table that support both these systems.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a name, current version, system(s), platform(s), and license. The relevant columns for checking this claim would be \"system\" and \"platform.\" Specifically, the \"system\" column might indicate which hardware it's targeting, but I think the actual platforms run on are in the \"platform\" column.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, I see that the \"system\" is listed as nintendo 64 for each row. So maybe the system refers to the emulator's target (like Nintendo 64), while the platform refers to what it can run on. For example, one entry is for Windows and Xbox.\n\nSo, to check if an emulator runs on both Windows and Xbox, I should look at the \"platform\" column.\n\nNow, let me go through each row:\n\n1. 1964: Platforms are windows and xbox.\n2. 1964js: Only javascript.\n3. cen64: Platforms are windows, os x, gnu/linux.\n4. corn: Windows only.\n5. daedalusx64: Windows and psp.\n6. mupen64: Windows, os x, etc., but not xbox.\n7. mupen64plus: Same as above.\n8. mupen64plus, android edition: Android only.\n9. n64js: Javascript only.\n10. project64: Windows and xbox.\n11. sixtyforce: Os x only.\n12. ultrahle: Windows and xbox.\n\nSo, the emulators that run on both Windows and Xbox are 1964, daedalusx64 (no, psp isn't Xbox), project64, and ultrahle.\n\nWait, wait. Daedalusx64 runs on Windows and PSP. PSP is a different platform from Xbox. So it's not both Windows and Xbox.\n\nSo the correct list would be:\n\n- 1964: Windows, Xbox\n- Project64: Windows, Xbox\n- Ultrahle: Windows, Xbox\n\nThat's three emulators. Also, looking at the table, I don't see any others that support both Windows and Xbox.\n\nWait, is there another one? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1964 - yes.\n1964js - no.\ncen64 - includes windows, os x, etc., but not Xbox as a platform?\nWait, in the table, \"system\" is nintendo 64, but the platforms are listed. So for cen64, the platform is windows, os x, gnu/linux. So it's not Xbox.\n\nProject64: yes.\nUltrahle: yes.\n\nSo that makes three emulators that run on both Windows and Xbox. The claim says \"only 3 emulator,\" so it seems true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any others. Let me see:\n\nLooking through each row's platform:\n\n- 1964: windows, xbox\n- daedalusx64: windows, psp\n- project64: windows, xbox\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox\n\nNo others. So three emulators.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because only three emulators run on both Windows and Xbox.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that there are exactly three emulators (1964, Project64, and Ultrahle) that support both Windows and Xbox platforms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various emulators along with their current versions, systems they support, platforms they run on, and their licenses. The claim in question is about mupen64plus Android Edition being the only emulator that runs on Android. \n\nSo, my goal is to check if any other emulator also runs on Android, which would make the claim FALSE, or if there are no others, making it TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an emulator. The relevant columns for this check seem to be \"name\", \"system\", and \"platform\". Specifically, I'm interested in the \"platform\" column because that's where it says \"android\".\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **1964**: Platforms are Windows and Xbox. No Android.\n2. **1964js**: Platforms are Nintendo 64 and JavaScript. No Android.\n3. **cen64**: Platforms include Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux. No Android.\n4. **corn**: Only Windows. No Android.\n5. **daedalusx64**: Runs on Windows and PSP. No Android.\n6. **mupen64**: Supports multiple platforms including Windows, OS X, etc., but I don't see Android here. Wait, actually, in the row, it says \"windows , os x , gnu / linux , freebsd , qnx beos\". No mention of Android.\n7. **mupen64plus**: Platforms include Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, Free BSD. No Android listed.\n8. **mupen64plus , android edition (ae)**: Here's the one that does run on Android. Its platform is Android.\n9. **n64js**: Runs on Nintendo 64 and JavaScript. No Android mentioned.\n10. **project64**: Windows and Xbox. No Android.\n11. **sixtyforce**: OS X only. No.\n12. **ultrahle**: Windows and Xbox. No.\n\nWait, but looking back at row 8, it's the only one that explicitly mentions \"android\" as a platform. So, are there any others?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me double-check. The row for mupen64plus, android edition (ae) is the only one with \"Android\" in the platform column.\n\nBut wait, looking again at row 7: mupen64plus has platforms including Android? No, in row 7, it's mupen64plus without the (ae), and its platform is listed as windows, os x, etc., but no Android. The Android edition is row 8.\n\nSo only row 8 mentions Android as a platform. Therefore, there are no other emulators besides mupen64plus, Android Edition that run on Android.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android\". So if that's the case, and no others do, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should check all other rows. Let me scan again quickly:\n\n- 1964: Windows, Xbox.\n- 1964js: N64, JavaScript.\n- cen64: Win, OS X, Linux.\n- corn: Windows.\n- daedalusx64: Win, PSP.\n- mupen64: Win, etc., no Android.\n- mupen64plus: same as above.\n- n64js: N64 and JS.\n- project64: Win, Xbox.\n- sixtyforce: OS X.\n- ultrahle: Win, Xbox.\n\nNone of these others mention Android. So yes, only the 8th row's emulator runs on Android. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because it's the sole emulator listed that supports Android.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The user might think that maybe other emulators have Android versions not explicitly mentioned here, but based on the table, only mupen64plus (ae) is present in the \"platform\" column for Android. So the claim stands as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because among all the listed emulators, only \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" runs specifically on Android.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"mupen64 runs 1 more platform than any other emulator, include javascript.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that mupen64 supports one more platform than any other emulator in the list, specifically mentioning JavaScript.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different emulator with various details like current version, system, platforms it runs on, and license. My task is to focus only on the relevant cells related to mupen64 and its supported platforms.\n\nI'll start by locating mupen64 in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see \"mupen64\" at row index 6, with current version 0.5.1, system Nintendo 64, platforms windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos, and license GPL v2. Then, there's another entry for mupen64plus at row 7, which includes an Android edition (ae).\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" So I need to compare how many platforms each emulator supports.\n\nLet me list out all the emulators and count their supported platforms:\n\n- 1964: windows, xbox \u2192 2\n- 1964js: javascript \u2192 1\n- cen64: windows, os x, gnu/linux \u2192 3\n- corn: windows \u2192 1\n- daedalusx64: windows, psp \u2192 2\n- mupen64: windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos \u2192 5 platforms\n- mupen64plus: windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd \u2192 4\n- mupen64plus, android edition (ae): android \u2192 1\n- n64js: javascript \u2192 1\n- project64: windows, xbox \u2192 2\n- sixtyforce: os x \u2192 1\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox \u2192 2\n\nSo the number of platforms each emulator supports is as above. The claim states that mupen64 runs on one more platform than any other emulator. Let's check if that's true.\n\nLooking at the list, mupen64 supports 5 platforms, which are more than most others. For example:\n\n- cen64 has 3\n- daedalusx64 has 2\n- project64 has 2\n- ultrahle has 2\n- others have fewer\n\nSo yes, mupen64 supports the highest number of platforms (5) compared to all others listed.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"include javascript.\" Looking at the table, both 1964js and n64js support JavaScript. So is the claim saying that mupen64 includes JavaScript? No, because in its row, mupen64's supported platforms don't include JavaScript. It supports more general platforms like OS X, etc., but not specifically JavaScript. \n\nSo the claim might be misleading here. It says \"include javascript\" as part of why mupen64 has one more platform than others, but actually, mupen64 doesn't support JavaScript; it's other emulators that do.\n\nTherefore, there seems to be a mistake in the claim. Mupen64 supports more platforms overall, but not including JavaScript. The inclusion of JavaScript is by 1964js and n64js only.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the row for mupen64 and perhaps others to check their platform counts. \n\nWait, but the claim's main point is that mupen64 has one more platform than any other emulator, including JavaScript. But since mupen64 doesn't support JavaScript, this part of the claim isn't accurate. However, the initial part about having more platforms is correct.\n\nBut does the claim say that it's the only one with that many platforms, or just that it runs on one more than others? Let me read again: \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator , include javascript.\" It might mean that mupen64 supports an additional platform beyond what others do, and among those is JavaScript. But since mupen64 doesn't support JavaScript, this part isn't correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because while mupen64 does have the highest number of platforms, it's not including JavaScript as one of them. The inclusion of JavaScript is done by other emulators, not mupen64.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"platforms\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the claim first: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license and 1 of 2 which run on window, and also be compatible with javascript.\"\n\nSo, I'll start by examining each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table provided. The table has several columns: name, current version, system, platform, and license. Each row represents a different emulator with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"corn\" specifically. So I should find the row for \"corn.\" Looking through the table:\n\n| name                               | current version   | system      | platform                                          | license        |\n|:-----------------------------------|:------------------|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------|:---------------|\n| ...                                   | ...               | ...         | ...                                              | ...            |\n| corn                               | 0.3               | nintendo 64 | windows                                           | proprietary    |\n\nSo \"corn\" is the fifth row (row index 4, since we start counting from 0). Its platform is \"windows,\" and its license is \"proprietary.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Emulator with a Proprietary License**: The claim says \"1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license.\" So I need to check if there are exactly three emulators with a proprietary license.\n\nLooking through the table, let's list all emulators and their licenses:\n\n- 1964: GPL v2\n- 1964js: GPL v2\n- cen64: BSD 3 - clause\n- corn: Proprietary\n- daedalusx64: GPL v2\n- mupen64: GPL v2\n- mupen64plus: GPL v2\n- mupen64plus , android edition (ae): GPL v3\n- n64js: Expat\n- project64: GPL v2\n- sixtyforce: Proprietary\n- ultrahle: Proprietary\n\nNow, counting the proprietary licenses:\n\n- corn: Proprietary\n- sixtyforce: Proprietary\n- ultrahle: Proprietary\n\nThat's three emulators with a proprietary license. So that part checks out.\n\n2. **Runs on Windows**: The claim says \"1 of 2 which run on window.\" Wait, I think it means \"runs on windows\" as one of two platforms. But looking at the table, the platform for corn is only listed as \"windows,\" so maybe there's another emulator that also runs on windows.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- 1964: windows, xbox\n- 1964js: javascript\n- cen64: nintendo64 with multiple platforms (windows, os x, etc.)\n- corn: windows\n- daedalusx64: windows, psp\n- mupen64: multiple platforms including windows\n- mupen64plus: same as above\n- mupen64plus ae: android\n- n64js: javascript\n- project64: windows, xbox\n- sixtyforce: os x\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox\n\nWait, but the \"platform\" column for corn is just \"windows,\" while others may have multiple. So if we consider only those that specifically run on windows (without other platforms), perhaps only corn and project64 are exclusive to windows?\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the table:\n\n- 1964: windows, xbox\n- 1964js: javascript\n- cen64: nintendo64 with many platforms\n- corn: windows\n- daedalusx64: windows, psp\n- mupen64: multiple including windows\n- mupen64plus: same as above\n- mupen64plus ae: android\n- n64js: javascript\n- project64: windows, xbox\n- sixtyforce: os x\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox\n\nSo, emulators that run on windows (including others):\n\nBut the claim says \"1 of 2 which run on window.\" So it's referring to two emulators that specifically run on windows. Wait, perhaps the user meant two platforms in total? Or maybe the emulators are running on two different platforms.\n\nWait, the original claim says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license and 1 of 2 which run on window, and also be compatible with javascript.\"\n\nSo the second part is about being one of two that run on windows. So corn runs on windows, but are there only two emulators in total that run on windows?\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- 1964: runs on windows, xbox\n- daedalusx64: runs on windows, psp\n- mupen64: runs on multiple including windows\n- project64: runs on windows, xbox\n- corn: only windows\n- ultrahle: runs on windows, xbox\n\nSo the emulators that have windows as a platform:\n\n1964 (windows, xbox)\ndaedalusx64 (windows, psp)\nmupen64 (windows and others)\nproject64 (windows, xbox)\ncorn (windows)\nultrahle (windows, xbox)\n\nThat's more than two. So if the claim says \"1 of 2 which run on window,\" that might not be accurate because there are more than two emulators running on windows.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret. Perhaps the user is saying that corn runs on two platforms: one being window and another? Wait no, in the table, corn's platform is only windows. So perhaps the claim is incorrect in this part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to the number of emulators that run on windows as two. But from above, there are more than two.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, some rows list multiple platforms separated by commas. For example, \"windows , xbox\" for 1964 and daedalusx64. So perhaps the count is per platform. Wait no, each row lists all platforms it supports.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that among the three proprietary license emulators (corn, sixtyforce, ultrahle), corn is one of two that run on windows. Let's check:\n\ncorn: runs on windows\nsixtyforce: runs on os x only\nultrahle: runs on windows and xbox\n\nSo among these three, corn and ultrahle run on windows, making it two emulators. So perhaps the claim refers to this context.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"1 of 2 which run on window,\" so if we consider only the three proprietary license emulators, then yes, corn is one (and ultrahle is the other) that run on windows.\n\nSo that part would be correct: corn is one of two (along with ultrahle) that run on windows.\n\nAdditionally, does corn also run on another platform? The table says \"windows,\" so perhaps not. So maybe that's okay.\n\nThird part: \"and also be compatible with javascript.\" But looking at the table, 1964js runs on javascript, but corn is listed as running only on windows. Unless I'm misreading.\n\nWait, in the table, the \"platform\" column for corn says \"windows,\" and for n64js it's \"javascript.\"\n\nSo unless corn also supports javascript, which it doesn't according to the table, this part would be incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is saying that corn is compatible with two platforms: one being windows (as per the first condition) and another being javascript. But from the table, corn only runs on windows, so it wouldn't be compatible with javascript.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that among the three proprietary emulators, two of them run on windows, and one does not (sixtyforce). So perhaps that's a different way to interpret.\n\nBut the third part says \"and also be compatible with javascript.\" That would require corn to support both windows and javascript. But from the table, it only supports windows.\n\nSo this might make the entire statement incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the claim, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nTo sum up:\n\n1. Corn is one of three proprietary emulators.\n2. Among those three, two run on windows (corn and ultrahle), so corn is one of two.\n3. But corn doesn't support javascript, only windows.\n\nSo if the third condition requires compatibility with javascript, that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim intended to say that among the three proprietary emulators, corn is compatible with both windows and another platform, but that's not accurate either.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the entire statement is incorrect because corn doesn't support javascript.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Let me re-examine the table:\n\nLooking at the \"platform\" column for each row:\n\n- 1964: windows, xbox\n- 1964js: javascript\n- cen64: nintendo64; platforms: windows, os x, etc.\n- corn: windows\n- daedalusx64: nintendo64; platforms: windows, psp\n- mupen64: nintendo64; platforms: windows, os x, linux\n- mupen64plus ae: android\n- n64js: javascript\n- project64: nintendo64; platforms: windows, xbox\n- sixtyforce: nintendo64; platform: os x\n- ultrahle: nintendo64; platforms: windows, xbox\n\nSo:\n\nProprietary emulators:\n\n1. corn (windows)\n2. sixtyforce (os x)\n3. ultrahle (windows, xbox)\n\nSo of these three, only corn and ultrahle support windows.\n\nTherefore, in the context of these three, corn is indeed one of two that run on windows.\n\nAdditionally, does corn also support javascript? No, it's listed as only supporting windows. So perhaps the third condition is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim intended to refer to another platform for corn, but from the table, it doesn't list javascript as a supported platform.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe statement says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulators with proprietary licenses and 1 of 2 which run on windows and also compatible with javascript.\"\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- Corn is indeed one of three with proprietary licenses.\n- It's one of two (along with ultrahle) that run on windows.\n- However, it does not support javascript.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement would be incorrect because corn isn't compatible with javascript. Unless I'm misreading something.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how platforms are listed. For example, if an emulator supports both windows and javascript, but from the table, 1964js is separate.\n\nLooking again:\n\ncorn: windows\nsixtyforce: os x\nultrahle: windows, xbox\n\nSo no, corn doesn't support javascript.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect because corn does not run on javascript.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that corn runs on two platforms: one being window and another being something else. But according to the table, it's only windows.\n\nWait, but in some cases, \"windows\" could include multiple versions or something, but I don't think so. It seems like it's a single platform.\n\nSo, overall:\n\nThe claim is partially correct in that corn is one of three proprietary emulators and one of two (along with ultrahle) that run on windows, but incorrect in stating that corn is compatible with javascript.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement would be factually incorrect because of the third part.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, while the claim correctly identifies corn as one of three proprietary emulators and as one of two running on Windows (alongside ultrahle), it inaccurately states that corn is compatible with JavaScript. Therefore, the statement contains an error regarding compatibility with JavaScript.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is partially correct but contains an inaccuracy. Specifically, while corn is indeed one of three proprietary emulators and runs on Windows (alongside ultrahle), it does not support JavaScript.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"there be 6 emulator release under the gpl v2 license , but only sixtyforce be release under the gpl v3 license.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"there be 6 emulator releases under the GPL v2 license.\" I need to count how many entries in the table have \"GPL v2\" as their license. Let me scan through the 'license' column:\n\n- 1964: GPL v2\n- 1964js: GPL v2\n- cen64: BSD 3 - clause\n- corn: Proprietary\n- daedalusx64: GPL v2\n- mupen64: GPL v2\n- mupen64plus: GPL v2\n- mupen64plus , android edition (ae): GPL v3\n- n64js: Expat\n- project64: GPL v2\n- sixtyforce: Proprietary\n- ultrahle: Proprietary\n\nCounting the GPL v2 entries: 1964, 1964js, daedalusx64, mupen64, mupen64plus, project64. That's six emulators under GPL v2. So that part checks out.\n\nNow the second part: \"only sixtyforce be released under the GPL v3 license.\" Looking at the table, I need to see if any other emulator is under GPL v3 besides sixtyforce. Checking each entry:\n\n- Only mupen64plus , android edition (ae) has GPL v3 as its license.\n\nSo there's another one besides sixtyforce. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states only sixtyforce is under GPL v3, but actually, there's another one.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check. The row for mupen64plus , android edition (ae) has a license of GPL v3. So that's two emulators under GPL v3: sixtyforce and the Android edition of mupen64plus. Therefore, the claim is false because it says only sixtyforce is under GPL v3, but there's another.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The entry for mupen64plus , android edition (ae) is listed as having GPL v3. So that's two emulators: mupen64plus Android and perhaps others? Wait, no, only that one. So the claim says \"only sixtyforce,\" but there's another. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the table, under 'license' for mupen64plus , android edition (ae), it's GPL v3. So that's one besides sixtyforce? Wait, looking back:\n\n- The row for \"sixtyforce\" has a license of proprietary.\n- The row for \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" has a license of GPL v3.\n\nSo, in the claim, it says only sixtyforce is under GPL v3, but there's another emulator under GPL v3. Therefore, the claim is false because more than one emulator is under GPL v3.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"only sixtyforce be release under the gpl v3 license.\" So if there's another, then the claim is incorrect. So the first part of the claim about six under GPL v2 is correct, but the second part is incorrect because there's more than just sixtyforce under GPL v3.\n\nTherefore, since one part is correct and the other isn't, does that mean the entire claim is false? Yes, because both parts have to be true for the claim to hold. Since the second part is wrong, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: six emulators under GPL v2 and only sixtyforce under GPL v3. The first part is correct with six entries. However, the second part is incorrect as there's another emulator (mupen64plus Android edition) also under GPL v3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"only 3 emulator run on both window and xbox , corn , daedalusx64 , and mupen64\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: name, current version, system, platform, and license. Each row represents a different emulator with its corresponding details.\n\nThe claim mentions three emulators running on both Windows and Xbox: corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64. My job is to verify if these are the only three that run on both platforms.\n\nI'll start by looking at each of the named emulators in the table:\n\n1. **Corn**: Looking up 'corn' in the table, it's row 4 with platform \"windows\". So corn only runs on Windows, not Xbox. That means it shouldn't be included as an emulator running on both platforms.\n\n2. **DaedalusX64**: This is row 5. The platforms listed are \"windows, psp\". It doesn't mention Xbox, so daedalusx64 also doesn't run on Xbox. So this one shouldn't count either.\n\n3. **Mupen64plus and mupen64plus Android Edition (ae)**: Mupen64plus is row 7 with platforms including Windows, OS X, Linux, etc., but not Xbox. The Android edition is row 8, which only runs on Android, so it's separate from Xbox.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64\". But when I check each one:\n\n- Corn: Only Windows.\n- DaedalusX64: Windows and PSP. No Xbox.\n- Mupen64plus and ae: Don't list Xbox either.\n\nHmm, none of them run on both Windows and Xbox. So the claim is actually FALSE because there are no emulators in the table that run on both platforms as claimed. Additionally, I should check if any other emulator does support both Windows and Xbox.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n- **1964**: Platforms \"windows, xbox\" \u2014 so this one runs on both.\n- **1964js**: Only JavaScript.\n- **cen64**: Multiple platforms including Windows, OS X, Linux. Doesn't mention Xbox.\n- **corn**: Only Windows.\n- **daedalusx64**: Windows and PSP.\n- **mupen64**: Platforms include Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS. No Xbox mentioned in the version listed here (2.0).\n- **mupen64plus**: Similar to mupen64, no mention of Xbox.\n- **n64js**: JavaScript only.\n- **project64**: Runs on Windows and Xbox. So this one does run on both.\n- **sixtyforce**: Only OS X.\n- **ultrahle**: Windows and Xbox.\n\nSo besides 1964 and project64 and ultrahle, I think there are more than three emulators that run on both Windows and Xbox.\n\nWait, but the claim is about only three: corn, daedalusx64, mupen64. None of them actually run on both platforms as per the table. So the claim's assertion is incorrect because it includes emulators that don't support both systems, and there are other emulators (like 1964, project64, ultrahle) that do run on both.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. There are not only three but more than that, and some listed in the claim don't even run on Xbox.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64 run on both Windows and Xbox.

The claim says: \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae) be the only emulator that runs on Android and JavaScript.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists several emulators with their details. My task is to check if there's any other emulator besides mupen64plus AE that runs on both Android and JavaScript.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\n1. 1964: It's for Nintendo 64, runs on Windows and Xbox. So not relevant.\n2. 1964js: Also Nintendo 64, but runs in JavaScript. So this is an emulator that uses JavaScript, but I need to check if it's Android-compatible. The system listed is JavaScript, so maybe it's a web-based emulator for desktops? Not sure about Android here.\n3. cen64: Runs on Windows, OS X, and GNU/Linux. No mention of Android.\n4. corn: Windows only. Not relevant.\n5. daedalusx64: Runs on Windows and PSP. No Android mentioned.\n6. mupen64: Multiple platforms, including Windows, OS X, Linux, etc. It's JavaScript-based but runs on various systems, not specifically Android.\n7. mupen64plus: Similar to mupen64, but more advanced. It's also JavaScript-based and runs on several platforms, including Android via the AE edition.\n8. n64js: Runs in JavaScript and is a Nintendo 64 emulator. No info on Android support here.\n9. project64: Windows and Xbox only. Not relevant.\n10. sixtyforce: OS X only. Not relevant.\n11. ultrahle: Windows and Xbox. Not relevant.\n\nFrom this, I need to see if any other emulator besides mupen64plus AE runs on Android and JavaScript. The claim says \"the only,\" so I have to check for others.\n\nLooking at 1964js: It's a Nintendo 64 emulator that runs in JavaScript. Does it run on Android? The system column shows \"javascript,\" but the platform includes windows, xbox, os x, etc., but nothing about Android. So maybe it's web-based only, not native Android.\n\nn64js is another JavaScript-based emulator for N64. The platforms listed are javascript and others like Windows, but no mention of Android. So perhaps not.\n\nmupen64plus AE specifically mentions Android as a platform. It uses JavaScript as its system. So that one runs on both Android and JavaScript. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"the only\" emulator. So I need to check if any other emulators also run on Android and JavaScript.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- Only mupen64plus AE is listed under \"system\" as android.\n- Other JavaScript-based emulators (1964js, n64js) don't mention Android support.\n\nSo perhaps there are no others. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE because mupen64plus AE is the only one mentioned in the table that runs on both Android and JavaScript.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. I'm not sure if 1964js or n64js can run on Android through web browsers. The system column for them says \"javascript,\" which might mean they're purely web-based, requiring a browser, not native apps. So maybe they don't count as running on Android in the sense of a native app.\n\nTherefore, only mupen64plus AE is explicitly listed to run on Android and JavaScript (as it's a native app).
