    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"in 2012 , the oakland raiders lose to the kansas city chief at arrowhead stadium with a result of 15 - 0\".\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a specific year (2012), two teams (Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs), a location (Arrowhead Stadium), and a score (15-0). It also states that the Raiders lost to the Chiefs.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any rows related to 2012 where both teams mentioned are involved. The table has several years: 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Focusing on 2012:\n\n- October 28, 2012: Oakland Raiders vs Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 26-16.\n- December 16, 2012: Oakland Raiders vs Kansas City Chiefs at OCO Coliseum with a score of 15-0.\n\nSo, in 2012, there are two games between the Raiders and the Chiefs. The first is in October at Arrowhead Stadium, resulting in a 26-16 win for the Raiders. The second game is in December at OCO Coliseum, where the Raiders won 15-0.\n\nThe claim specifies that in 2012, the Raiders lost to the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a 15-0 score. Now, I need to check if such a game exists as described.\n\nLooking at the October 28th game: The Raiders won, not lost. The December 16th game was a win for the Raiders with a score of 15-0. However, this game took place at OCO Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nArrowhead Stadium is where the Chiefs play their home games, so if there were a loss by the Raiders there, it would likely be in October when the Chiefs are playing at their home stadium. Wait, no\u2014wait: The location for each game is where the home team plays. So, if the Chiefs played at Arrowhead Stadium, that's their home field, so they'd be the home team.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\n- In 2010, the Raiders played both games (January and November) in Oakland.\n- In 2011, the Raiders lost in October at OCO Coliseum and won in December at Arrowhead Stadium. Wait, no: October 23 is Kansas City Chiefs vs Raiders at OCO Coliseum? No, wait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the table more carefully.\n\nIn 2010:\n- November 7: Raiders (Oakland) beat Chiefs (Kansas City) at Oakland Coliseum.\n- January 2, 2011: Raiders (as they were in 2010) lost to Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. The table's columns are year, date, winner, result, loser, location.\n\nSo for 2010:\n- Nov 7: Raiders won against Chiefs (23-20 OT)\n- Jan 2, 2011: Raiders again? But that would be in 2011. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the date is January 2, 2011, which would make it part of 2010 or 2011. Hmm.\n\nWait, regardless, let me focus on 2012.\n\nIn 2012:\n- October 28: Raiders (at Arrowhead Stadium) vs Chiefs? Wait no, location is Arrowhead Stadium. So if the location is Arrowhead Stadium, that's where the Chiefs play home games. Therefore, in that game, the home team would be the Chiefs, so they should be listed as the winner or loser based on their performance at their own stadium.\n\nLooking at the table for 2012:\n\n- October 28: Raiders vs Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Result is Raiders 26, Chiefs 16. So the Raiders won this game.\n- December 16: Raiders vs Chiefs at OCO Coliseum. Raiders won 15-0.\n\nSo in neither of these games did the Raiders lose to the Chiefs. The claim says they lost with a score of 15-0 at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nWait, but 15-0 was a win for the Raiders in December at OCO Coliseum, not a loss. So the claim is incorrect because:\n\n1. The result of 15-0 in 2012 was a win for the Raiders, not a loss.\n2. The location was OCO Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nAdditionally, there's no game where the Raiders lost to the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a 15-0 score. In fact, all games in 2012 were wins for the Raiders against the Chiefs, either at Arrowhead or OCO.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because none of the games match all the criteria stated.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}]}",
