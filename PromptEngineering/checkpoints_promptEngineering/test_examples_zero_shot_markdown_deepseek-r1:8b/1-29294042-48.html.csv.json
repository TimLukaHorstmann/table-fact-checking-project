    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"each and every competitor compete in different weight class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, finals. Each row represents a different competitor with their respective events and results in each round.\n\nThe claim is about whether every competitor is in a different weight class. So, I need to check if all the athletes listed have unique weight classes. Looking at the 'event' column, each athlete's event seems to be categorized by weight, like \"finweight (-54 kg)\", \"flyweight (-58 kg)\", etc.\n\nWait, let me list out all the events from the table:\n\n1. nariman shakirov - finweight (-54 kg)\n2. zhalgas bekkassymov - flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. darkhan kassymkulov - bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. aibar dyussebayev - lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. sultan kassymov - welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nHmm, each of these weight classes is distinct and there's no overlap. So, each competitor is in a different weight class.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"each and every competitor,\" so I need to ensure that all athletes are in unique weight classes. Since there are five competitors and five unique weight classes listed, it looks like they're all in separate categories.\n\nI don't see any duplicates or same weight classes for different athletes. For example, no two athletes have the same event as per the 'event' column. Each has a unique event name with their respective weight.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because every competitor is indeed competing in a different weight class.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"not 1 kazakhstani advance to the quarterfinal or past that\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that none of the Kazakhstani athletes advanced beyond the quarterfinals. So, I need to check each Kazakhstani athlete in the table and see if any of them made it past the quarterfinals into later rounds like semifinals or finals.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different athlete from Kazakhstan. The \"event\" column indicates the weight category they're competing in. Now, I need to check for each athlete whether they advanced beyond the quarterfinals.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Nariman Shakirov**: He competes in finweight (-54 kg). In the round of 32, he faced mateus soares and won with 19-5 points. Then in the round of 16, he lost to ajaiman al-ojaiman with a score of 4-6. Since he didn't advance past the round of 16, he definitely didn't make it to the quarterfinals or beyond.\n\n2. **Zhalgas Bekkasymov**: He's in flyweight (-58 kg). He had a bye in the round of 32. Then in the round of 16, he lost to pen-ek Karaket with a score of 3-4. Again, he didn't advance past the round of 16, so no progress beyond that.\n\n3. **Darkhan Kassymkulov**: Competes in bantamweight (-63 kg). He beat surendra Bhandari in the round of 32 (8-7), then lost to jawad Lakzaee in the round of 16 with a score of 5-10. So, he didn't make it past the round of 16 either.\n\n4. **Aibar Dyussebayev**: In lightweight (-74 kg). He had a bye in the round of 32. Then lost to Dmitriy Kim in the round of 16 with a score of 3-4. So, no advancement beyond that.\n\n5. **Sultan Kassymov**: Welterweight (-80 kg). Bye in the round of 32, then lost to alisher Gulov in the round of 16 with a score of 2-6. Again, didn't advance past the round of 16.\n\nFrom this analysis, all Kazakhstani athletes did not advance beyond the round of 16. None made it to the quarterfinals or semifinals or finals. Therefore, the claim that \"not 1 kazakhstani advance to the quarterfinal or past that\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant to support this claim. The key columns to look at are the ones indicating the farthest round each athlete reached. These columns are: round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and final.\n\nFor each Kazakhstani athlete, we check if they advanced beyond the quarterfinals. If all have 'did not advance' in quarters or further rounds, then those cells support the claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Nariman Shakirov: round of 16 is 'did not advance'\n- Zhalgas Bekkasymov: same as above\n- Darkhan Kassymkulov: same\n- Aibar Dyussebayev: same\n- Sultan Kassymov: same\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in the columns for each athlete where they didn't advance beyond the quarterfinals. Therefore, I need to list each of their round of 16 and further columns.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"to the quarterfinal or past that.\" So, if an athlete didn't even reach the quarterfinals, does that still count? Yes, because not advancing means they are included in the 'not 1' part.\n\nTherefore, for each athlete, the cells to check are:\n\n- round of 16 (since if they lost there, they didn't advance)\n- quarterfinals\n- semifinals\n- final\n\nSo, for each row, we can extract these columns and see if they all say 'did not advance'.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include for each athlete their \"round of 32\", but actually, since round of 32 is a win or loss, but in this case, some have 'bye', which I think means they automatically advanced without facing someone. So, maybe the relevant cells are from quarterfinals onwards.\n\nWait, let me clarify: If an athlete has a bye in the round of 32, does that mean they automatically advance? Yes, because a bye allows them to proceed without fighting. So their progress is based on the next rounds.\n\nFor example, Zhalgas Bekkasymov had a bye in round of 32, then lost in round of 16. So he advanced to round of 16 but didn't make it further. Therefore, his cells in \"round of 32\" (bye), \"round of 16\", etc., but we need to see if any of them reached the quarterfinals or beyond.\n\nBut in this case, none of them reached the quarterfinals because all had 'did not advance' in that column and beyond. So for each athlete, their cells from round of 16 onwards are relevant.\n\nWait, but maybe I should include all columns starting from where they might have advanced. Alternatively, perhaps only the columns after round of 32.\n\nBut to be precise, since the claim is about advancing past quarterfinals, we need to check if any of them reached quarterfinals or beyond. So for each athlete, their \"quarterfinals\", \"semifinals\", and \"final\" cells are all 'did not advance', which means they didn't make it past round of 16.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor each athlete, the columns: round of 32 (maybe?), quarterfinals, semifinals, final. But since the claim is about advancing to quarterfinals or beyond, the key is whether they reached the quarterfinals or not. So for each athlete, their \"quarterfinals\" cell needs to be checked, as well as any further rounds if applicable.\n\nWait, but in the table, for each athlete, the cells after round of 32 show whether they advanced. If an athlete lost in round of 16, they didn't advance beyond that, so they definitely didn't make it to quarterfinals.\n\nTherefore, to confirm none advanced past quarterfinals, we need to check for each athlete if their \"quarterfinals\" cell is 'did not advance' and that they did not have a bye or win in the next rounds. But since all have 'did not advance' in quarterfinals and beyond, it's safe.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\nFor each Kazakhstani athlete, the cells under \"quarterfinals\", \"semifinals\", and \"final\". Because if any of these show an advancement (not 'did not advance'), then the claim is wrong. But since all are 'did not advance', those cells support the claim.\n\nSo for each row, we need to include their values in \"quarterfinals\", \"semifinals\", \"final\" columns.\n\nTherefore, relevant_cells would be:\n\n[\n  {\"row\": 0, \"col\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n  {\"row\": 0, \"col\": \"semifinals\"},\n  {\"row\": 0, \"col\": \"final\"},\n  {\"row\": 1, \"col\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n  ...\n]\n\nBut in the data structure, I'm not sure how it's presented. Assuming each row has these columns, we can list them as such.\n\nSo in conclusion, all Kazakhstani athletes did not advance past round of 16, so none made it to quarterfinals or beyond. Hence, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are their \"quarterfinals\", \"semifinals\", and \"final\" columns.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying whether no Kazakhstani athlete advanced to the quarterfinals or further in a competition. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- All five Kazakhstani athletes did not advance beyond the round of 16.\n- None reached the quarterfinals, semifinals, or finals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is **TRUE**, as no Kazakhstani athlete advanced past the round of 16.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nFor each athlete, include their results in the \"quarterfinals\", \"semifinals\", and \"final\" columns.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row\": 0,\n    \"col\": \"quarterfinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 0,\n    \"col\": \"semifinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 0,\n    \"col\": \"final\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 1,\n    \"col\": \"quarterfinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 1,\n    \"col\": \"semifinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 1,\n    \"col\": \"final\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 2,\n    \"col\": \"quarterfinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 2,\n    \"col\": \"semifinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 2,\n    \"col\": \"final\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 3,\n    \"col\": \"quarterfinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 3,\n    \"col\": \"semifinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 3,\n    \"col\": \"final\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 4,\n    \"col\": \"quarterfinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 4,\n    \"col\": \"semifinals\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row\": 4,\n    \"col\": \"final\",\n    \"value\": \"did not advance\"\n  }\n]\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. The events are categorized by different weight classes like finweight (-54 kg), flyweight (-58 kg), bantamweight (-63 kg), lightweight (-74 kg), and welterweight (-80 kg). \n\nThe claim in question is about the heaviest competitor weighing 80 kilograms. So, I need to see if any of the athletes in the \"welterweight (-80 kg)\" event are noted as advancing beyond certain rounds or have a notable presence in the later stages.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Nariman Shakirov** is in the finweight category, so that's -54 kg.\n2. **Zhalgas Bekkassymov** is flyweight (-58 kg).\n3. **Darkhan Kassymkulov** is bantamweight (-63 kg).\n4. **Aibar Dyussebayev** is lightweight (-74 kg).\n5. **Sultan Kassymov** is welterweight (-80 kg).\n\nNow, I need to check each relevant column for these athletes, specifically looking at whether they advanced through the rounds.\n\nStarting with Sultan Kassymov in the welterweight division:\n\n- Round of 32: he has a 'bye', which usually means he didn't have to compete and automatically advances.\n- Round of 16: faced Alisher Gulov, lost (pts 2-6), so he did not advance here.\n\nThe key is that he at least made it past the round of 32. So he was in the competition as a welterweight, which is the heaviest category listed here.\n\nI need to confirm if any competitor heavier than him exists. From the table, all other athletes are in lighter weight classes. Therefore, Sultan Kassymov is indeed the heaviest competitor at -80 kg.\n\nSo, checking the claim: \"the heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram.\" Since Sultan Kassymov weighs -80 kg and made it to the round of 32, there's no one heavier than him in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine if the claim \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column in the table represents. The columns are: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, finals. But the claim is about weight, so I should focus on the \"event\" column because that's where the weights are listed.\n\nLooking at the \"event\" column for each athlete:\n- Nariman Shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg)\n- Zhalgas Bekassymov is in flyweight (-58 kg)\n- Darkhan Kassymkulov is in bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- Aibar Dyussebayev is in lightweight (-74 kg)\n- Sultan Kassymov is in welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nSo the events and corresponding weights are:\n1. Finweight: -54 kg\n2. Flyweight: -58 kg\n3. Bantamweight: -63 kg\n4. Lightweight: -74 kg\n5. Welterweight: -80 kg\n\nThe claim is that \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram.\" Wait, the wording here might be tricky. Does it mean the lightest competitor weighs 54 kg or does it mean the competitor's weight is 54 kg?\n\nBut looking at the table, the event for Nariman Shakirov is finweight (-54 kg). So his weight is -54 kg, which I think is a common way to denote that he competes in the 54 kg weight category.\n\nNow, the term \"lightest competitor\" refers to someone with the lowest weight. In the table, the athletes' events have weights as follows:\n- Finweight (-54 kg)\n- Flyweight (-58 kg)\n- Bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- Lightweight (-74 kg)\n- Welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nWait, that's confusing because lighter weights are actually lower numbers. So -54 is higher than -58, which is higher than -63, and so on. So the lightest competitor would be the one with the lowest weight, which is -80 kg (welterweight). But the claim says \"lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram,\" meaning 54 kg.\n\nBut wait, in the table, the event for Nariman Shakirov is finweight (-54 kg), so his weight is 54 kg? Or is it that he's fighting in the -54 kg division, which might mean he weighs around 54 kg but I'm not entirely sure how the negative signs work.\n\nWait, maybe the way it's written is that each event has a specific weight category. So for example, finweight (-54 kg) would mean competitors in that category weigh around 54 kg, but with the negative sign indicating something else? Or perhaps the numbers are just identifiers for the divisions.\n\nBut regardless of the negative signs, the key point is the claim says the lightest competitor weighs 54 kg. From the table, the athletes' events are as follows:\n\n- Nariman Shakirov: finweight (-54 kg)\n- Zhalgas Bekassymov: flyweight (-58 kg)\n- Darkhan Kassymkulov: bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- Aibar Dyussebayev: lightweight (-74 kg)\n- Sultan Kassymov: welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nSo the \"lightest\" competitor would be the one with the lowest weight, which is Sultan Kassymov at -80 kg. But his event is welterweight, so perhaps he weighs around 80 kg? Wait, that's confusing because the more negative the number, the lighter the weight?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers after the hyphen represent the weight in kilograms. So -54 kg means 54 kg, but that would mean the competitor weighs 54 kg. But then, if someone is in flyweight (-58 kg), does that mean they weigh 58 kg? That doesn't make sense because flyweight typically refers to a lower weight class than bantamweight.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. In mixed martial arts or similar sports, the lighter weight classes have numbers with hyphens, but the actual weight is positive. For example, a -54 kg fighter would weigh around 54 kg, which is a very lightweight category. But wait, that doesn't make sense because in reality, lighter classes have lower weights. So perhaps the negative sign indicates the division, not the actual weight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just a way to denote the event, and the actual weight is positive. For example, finweight (-54 kg) means competitors in that division weigh around 54 kg. But then, flyweight (-58 kg) would mean they weigh 58 kg, which is higher than 54, so they wouldn't be lighter.\n\nWait, that can't be right because lighter classes should have lower weights. So perhaps the negative sign indicates the order, and the actual weight is positive. For example, -54 kg means the competitor is in the lightest division at 54 kg, but then others are higher. But looking at the table, Sultan Kassymov is in welterweight (-80 kg), which would be a heavier category than lightweight.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the claim says \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram.\" So we need to see if any competitor's event is listed as finweight (-54 kg), which would mean they are in the 54 kg weight class, making them the lightest.\n\nIn the table, Nariman Shakirov is the only one with finweight (-54 kg). Therefore, he is the competitor in the 54 kg division. The claim says that the lightest competitor weighs 54 kg, so if \"lightest\" means the smallest event/weight class, then Nariman is indeed the lightest at -54 kg or 54 kg.\n\nBut wait, the negative sign might mean something else. Maybe it's a way to indicate the division within the weight class. For example, -54 kg could be a specific sub-divison within the lighter classes. However, without more context, I think we have to go with what's given in the table.\n\nSo, the claim is that the lightest competitor weighs 54 kg. From the table, Nariman Shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg), which likely means he competes at 54 kg. Since he is listed as finweight, and others are heavier categories (flyweight, bantamweight, etc.), he would indeed be the lightest.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because Nariman Shakirov's event is finweight (-54 kg), which corresponds to a weight of 54 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists athletes with their respective events. The claim states that \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram.\" By examining the \"event\" column, we find that Nariman Shakirov competes in finweight (-54 kg), making him the lightest competitor at 54 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"Determine if the statement is true based on the provided data.\",\n  \"statement\": \"You are tasked with determining whether the following statement is true or false: 'You are tasked with determining whether the following statement is true or false: 'The lightest competitor weighs 54 kilograms.'\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"In the table, the athlete's event is listed as finweight (-54 kg).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the mean weight of all competitors is 65.8 kilograms\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each column represents.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. The relevant information for calculating the mean weight would be in the \"event\" column because that's where the weights are specified. For example, nariman shakirov is competing in finweight (-54 kg), which I assume is his weight category.\n\nSince the claim mentions the mean weight of all competitors, I need to extract each competitor's event (their weight) from the table and calculate the average. Each row represents a different athlete with their respective events.\n\nI'll list out the events and convert them into kilograms since the claim uses kilograms:\n- nariman shakirov: finweight (-54 kg)\n- zhalgas bekkassymov: flyweight (-58 kg)\n- darkhan kassymkulov: bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- aibar dyussebayev: lightweight (-74 kg)\n- sultan kassymov: welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nWait, the events are in parentheses with negative numbers. I think those numbers represent the weight categories. So:\n- finweight (-54 kg) means the competitors' actual weights would be around 54 kg (I assume it's within a certain range, like -54 to -50 kg or similar). Similarly for others.\n\nTo find the mean, I need each competitor's weight in kilograms. Let me assign approximate values based on the event names:\n- nariman shakirov: ~54 kg\n- zhalgas bekkassymov: ~58 kg\n- darkhan kassymkulov: ~63 kg\n- aibar dyussebayev: ~74 kg\n- sultan kassymov: ~80 kg\n\nNow, let's sum these up:\n54 + 58 = 112\n112 + 63 = 175\n175 + 74 = 249\n249 + 80 = 329 kg total.\n\nThere are 5 competitors, so the mean would be 329 / 5 = 65.8 kg.\n\nWait, that matches the claim exactly. But let me double-check each step because sometimes in sports, the weight divisions might not directly translate to exact weights. For example, flyweight (-58 kg) is usually around 55-56 kg for men's competition, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the case here.\n\nIf the actual competitors' weights are different from what I assumed, the mean could vary. However, based on the information in the table, each athlete's event is listed with a specific weight category. Assuming these are their respective weights (e.g., -54 kg meaning 54 kg), then the calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the mean weight is 65.8 kg appears to be TRUE based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"only 1 competitor from Kazakhstan advances to the quarterfinals or beyond.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and see how many Kazakhstani competitors made it past the quarterfinals. To do that, I'll go through each row of the table and check if the athlete is from Kazakhstan.\n\nLooking at the first row: nariman shakirov. His event is finweight (-54 kg). The countries column isn't explicitly listed, but since his name seems Kazakhstani (ends with \"ov\"), he's probably from Kazakhstan. Now, checking his progression: he didn't advance beyond the round of 32, so he didn't make it to the quarterfinals or beyond.\n\nNext row: zhalgas bekkassymov. Flyweight (-58 kg). Again, the name suggests Kazakhstani origin. His results show he also didn't advance past the round of 16, so no progress to quarters or further.\n\nThird athlete: darkhan kassymkulov.

His results show he didn't advance beyond the round of 16 either.\n\nFifth athlete: sultan kassymov. Welterweight (-80 kg). Another Kazakhstani name. He also did not advance past the quarterfinals, as shown by his status in that column.\n\nSo, all five competitors from Kazakhstan (I assume based on names) didn't make it to the quarterfinals or beyond. That means none of them advanced past the quarterfinals. Therefore, only 0 competitors advanced, not just one. \n\nWait a second, maybe I'm missing something. The claim says \"only 1 competitor,\" but according to my analysis, there are zero who made it. That would mean the claim is FALSE because it's stating that only one advanced when actually none did.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check if all these athletes are indeed from Kazakhstan. Maybe some have different nationalities. Let me look at the competitors' names again:\n\n- nariman shakirov: Possibly Kazakhstani.\n- zhalgas bekkassymov: Likely Kazakhstani.\n- darkhan kassymkulov: Probably Kazakhstani.\n- aibar dyussebayev: Seems Kazakhstani.\n- sultan kassymov: Definitely Kazakhstani.\n\nAssuming all are from Kazakhstan, which I think they are, then none of them advanced beyond the quarterfinals. So the claim that only one did is incorrect because zero actually made it. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round of 16\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"each competitor compete in only the same weight class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim suggests that every athlete in the table competes within a single weight class. That means each athlete's event should be consistent across all rounds. For example, if an athlete starts in the round of 32, their event should be the same as in later rounds like the quarterfinals and semifinals, right?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check the athletes' weight classes and see if they remain the same throughout their progression.\n\nStarting with nariman shakirov in finweight (-54 kg). In the round of 32, he faces mateus soares. That's okay because it's within the same event. Then in the round of 16, he faces ajaiman al-ojaiman, again in finweight. But here's something: his next column shows \"did not advance,\" but that doesn't affect the weight class, just his advancement. So his event is consistent.\n\nNext, zhalgas bekkassymov in flyweight (-58 kg). In the round of 32, it's a bye, so no match. Round of 16 against pen-ek karaket, same event. So that looks good too.\n\nDarkhan kassymkulov in bantamweight (-63 kg) has a bye in the round of 32 and then faces surendra bhandari, same weight class. Then in the next rounds, he didn't advance but again, the event is consistent.\n\nAibar dyussebayev in lightweight (-74 kg). Bye in round of 32, then against dmitriy kim in round of 16, same event. So far, so good.\n\nLastly, Sultan kassymov in welterweight (-80 kg). He has a bye in the round of 32 and faces alisher gulov in the round of 16, same weight class.\n\nWait, but looking closer, each athlete's initial event is consistent throughout their matches. Each one starts in their respective weight class and remains there. They might not have advanced past certain rounds, but that doesn't change their event category. So it seems like all competitors are indeed competing in the same weight class as initially listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because each athlete's event is consistent across all columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the lightest competitor weigh more than 54 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column in the table represents. The columns are: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and final. From this, it seems like each row corresponds to an athlete competing in a specific weight category (like finweight, flyweight, etc.), and their performance across various rounds.\n\nThe claim is about the lightest competitor's weight. So, I need to identify which athletes are considered \"lightest\" and check their weights against the 54 kg threshold.\n\nLooking at the 'event' column, I see four different weight categories: finweight (-54 kg), flyweight (-58 kg), bantamweight (-63 kg), and lightweight (-74 kg). The lightest competitors would be those in the lighter weight classes. Among these, finweight is the lightest at -54 kg.\n\nNow, checking each athlete in the 'finweight' category: only nariman shakirov is listed here. According to the table, his event is finweight (-54 kg). So, he's our candidate for the lightest competitor.\n\nLooking at his performance, under the round of 32 column, it says \"mateus soares (tls) w pts 19 -5\". The 'w' here likely stands for win, but that doesn't directly affect his weight. His weight is -54 kg as per his event. \n\nThe claim states that this lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kilogram. Wait a second. If the athlete's weight is in kilograms and negative denotes weight above 54 kg (since it's finweight -54 kg), then a negative value doesn't make sense for the claim.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. In martial arts, like UFC, competitors are usually listed with their weight as a positive number followed by 'kg' if they're under 54 kg. For example, someone might be listed as 55 kg, which is 1 kg over the -54 mark. So, if an athlete's event is finweight (-54 kg), that means they weigh more than 54 kg but are in the lighter weight category.\n\nSo nariman shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg), which would mean he weighs just over 54 kg, perhaps around 55 or 56 kg. Therefore, his weight is more than 54 kg.\n\nSince he's the lightest competitor among those listed (others are heavier in their respective categories: flyweight at -58 kg implies they're lighter than finweight? Wait, that doesn't make sense because lower numbers would mean lighter. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, negative weight in this context might indicate something else. In some contexts, the negative sign denotes the total weight minus 54 kg for finweight. So a -54 kg would be exactly 54 kg, and someone with +1 kg would be 55 kg. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the negative sign indicates the weight class name, like -54 kg meaning up to 54 kg, so competitors are above that in actual weight. For example, if an athlete is in finweight (-54 kg), they might weigh around 56 kg or more.\n\nGiven that, nariman shakirov's event is finweight (-54 kg), and the claim says the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kg. Since he's the lightest (as per his weight class), his actual weight would be over 54 kg, supporting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is where the athlete nariman shakirov is listed in the 'event' column as finweight (-54 kg). So I need to find that row and the 'event' column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we focus on the lightest competitor's weight. From the table, nariman shakirov competes in finweight (-54 kg), indicating his actual weight is above 54 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the heaviest competitor weighs less than 80 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and how it relates to the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. The table has several columns: athlete name, event (which includes the weight class), and various rounds like round of 32, round of 16, etc., up to the final. The \"event\" column specifies the weight category each athlete is competing in, with details like \"-54 kg\" for finweight, \"-58 kg\" for flyweight, and so on.\n\nThe claim is about the heaviest competitor's weight. So I need to identify which athletes are competing in the highest weight classes because heavier competitors would be in higher weight divisions. The maximum weight class listed here is \"welterweight (-80 kg)\". Sultan Kassymov is in this category, as per the event column.\n\nNext, I should check if any of these athletes weigh more than 80 kg. Since the heaviest mentioned is Sultan Kassymov at -80 kg, that's exactly the upper limit. The claim says \"less than 80 kilogram.\" Now, I need to consider whether a weight category being exactly 80 kg falls under \"less than 80 kg.\"\n\nWait, \"-80 kg\" means the competitors weigh 80 kilograms. So is 80 considered less than or equal to 80? The term \"less than\" implies strictly below. If the competitor's weight is exactly 80 kg, then it doesn't satisfy \"less than.\" Therefore, this would mean the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any athletes in higher weight classes that might be heavier. Looking at the table, the highest event mentioned is welterweight (-80 kg). There are no higher categories listed here, so Sultan Kassymov's 80 kg is indeed the heaviest.\n\nSo the claim says \"the heaviest competitor weighs less than 80 kilogram.\" But since one competitor weighs exactly 80 kg, which isn't less than, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I identified the heaviest competitor in the highest weight class. Sultan Kassymov competes at -80 kg, which is exactly 80 kilograms. Since \"less than\" doesn't include equality, this makes the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"welterweight ( - 80 kg)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the mean weight of all competitors is less than 60 kilograms\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant for calculating the mean weight. The relevant columns here would be the weight classes of each athlete, as that directly relates to their weights. Looking at the table, each row has an \"event\" column that specifies the weight category (e.g., finweight, flyweight, bantamweight, lightweight, welterweight).\n\nNext, I need to extract the numerical values associated with each event. Each event corresponds to a specific weight range:\n\n- Finweight (-54 kg)\n- Flyweight (-58 kg)\n- Bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- Lightweight (-74 kg)\n- Welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nHowever, these are not exact numbers but ranges. Since the claim is about the mean weight being less than 60 kg, I need to consider whether each competitor's weight falls below 60 kg.\n\nLooking at each athlete:\n\n1. **nariman shakirov**: Finweight (-54 kg) \u2013 this is well below 60 kg.\n2. **zhalgas bekkassymov**: Flyweight (-58 kg) \u2013 also below 60 kg.\n3. **darkhan kassymkulov**: Bantamweight (-63 kg) \u2013 under 60 kg.\n4. **aibar dyussebayev**: Lightweight (-74 kg) \u2013 under 60 kg.\n5. **sultan kassymov**: Welterweight (-80 kg) \u2013 also below 60 kg.\n\nSince all athletes are in weight categories that are less than 60 kg, their individual weights would naturally be under 60 kg as well.
