    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\". Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the 1972 engine doesn't have its power specified in horsepower or kilowatts. So, I need to check if in the table, the power for the 1972 engine is not listed as hp or kw.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns: generation, years, engine, power, torque, induction. The \"power\" column likely refers to either horsepower (hp) or kilowatts (kw), depending on how it's recorded. So, for each relevant row, I need to check what's under the \"power\" column.\n\nNow, going through each row related to 1972. Let me scan the table:\n\n- The first few rows are about Oldsmobile engines from 1971 onwards.\n- In 1972 (row with years 1972), it says the engine is a 455in cubic Oldsmobile V8, and under power it's listed as \"-\". Wait, what does the \"-\" mean? Maybe that means the information isn't available or not specified. So, if the \"power\" column is \"-\", then perhaps it's indicating that the power isn't provided in hp or kw.\n\nSo, for 1972, the power is \"-\", which would mean no value is given. Therefore, according to the claim, since the power isn't given as hp or kw, the statement might be true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check other rows to see if any engine from that year has power specified. Let me look through all 1972 entries. In the table, only one row has years 1972: the first one under \"i\" for Oldsmobile V8 in 1972. All others are either different years or different engines.\n\nSo, yes, the only relevant entry is that in 1972, power is \"-\", which supports the claim that it's not given in hp or kw.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that the 1972 engine's power is marked as \"-\", indicating no specification of hp or kw. This aligns with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"power\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
