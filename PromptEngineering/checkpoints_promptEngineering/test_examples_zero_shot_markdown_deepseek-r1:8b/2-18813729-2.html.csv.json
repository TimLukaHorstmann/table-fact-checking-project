    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" Wait, there might be a typo here. It probably says \"year\" instead of \"ear,\" so it should read \"the year 2005 be the only year that do not have multiple songs.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I need to check each relevant cell to see if this claim holds.\n\nThe table has columns: year, artist, song, album, and remix. The task is to verify whether the claim about the year 2005 is true.\n\nSo, I should focus on the 'year' column for the year 2005 and check how many songs are listed under that year. If there's only one song in 2005, then the claim holds. But if there are multiple songs, it doesn't.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2003: Blondie, Chicane, Lamb \u2013 three artists with different songs.\n- 2005: Texas has one song listed.\n- 2010: Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique each have their own entries.\n\nSo, in 2005, there's only one song. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because 2005 is the only year without multiple songs.\n\nWait, but I should check other years too to make sure that no other years have a single song. For example:\n\n- 2003 has three entries.\n- 2010 has two entries.\n- So, yes, only 2005 has one song.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because 2005 is indeed the only year with a single song.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here\u2014probably meant \"not\" instead of \"be,\" but regardless, the main point is that among the songs with a remix by \"dead guys\" (I assume it's a typo for \"Dead Guy Remix\"), only one song should not be from the year 2003.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThere are five rows. Let me list them out with their years and relevant columns:\n\n1. 2003 | blondie | good boys | ... | dead guys remix\n2. 2003 | chicane | locking down | ... | dead guys remix\n3. 2003 | lamb | wonder | ... | dead guys remix\n4. 2005 | texas | can't resist | ... | dead guys remix\n5. 2010 | pixie lott | turn it up | ... | dee - lux remix\n6. 2010 | perry mystique | party like ur 18 feat sway | n / a | dee - lux remix\n\nWait, the table shows six rows because I see two entries for 2010. But actually, let me count again: no, each row is a separate entry. So, in total, there are six entries? Wait, the initial markdown table seems to have five rows, but looking closer:\n\nNo, wait, the original table has five rows with years 2003, 2003, 2003, 2005, and two entries for 2010. No, actually, let me recount:\n\n- 2003: three entries\n- 2005: one entry\n- 2010: two entries\n\nSo total of six entries? But the table seems to have five rows as per the markdown. Wait, no\u2014the markdown shows five rows because each row is a separate song. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe table has headers: year, artist, song, album, remix. Then under that, it lists five entries, each corresponding to a different song and year. Wait, but in 2003 there are three entries, in 2005 one, and in 2010 two, making six songs total? Or is the table split into multiple rows?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nEach row is separate:\n\n1. 2003 | blondie | good boys | ... | dead guys remix\n2. 2003 | chicane | locking down | ... | dead guys remix\n3. 2003 | lamb | wonder | ... | dead guys remix\n4. 2005 | texas | can't resist | ... | dead guys remix\n5. 2010 | pixie lott | turn it up | ... | dee - lux remix\n6. 2010 | perry mystique | ... | n / a | dee - lux remix\n\nWait, so there are six entries in total? Or is the table misaligned?\n\nNo, looking at the original markdown:\n\nIt's a single table with five rows because each row has one song. Wait no\u2014each entry under year is 2003, 2003, 2003, 2005, and two entries for 2010, making six total songs. So perhaps the table is displayed as multiple lines but is actually five or six rows.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me focus on the remix column and see which ones are \"dead guys remix\" vs. others.\n\nIn the first three entries (rows 0-2), the remix is \"dead guys remix.\" The fourth entry is also \"dead guys remix,\" but in 2005. Then, rows 4 and 5 have different remixes: \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nSo, looking for songs that are from \"dead guys remix\":\n\nRows 0-3: four songs with \"dead guys remix\" across years 2003 and 2005.\n\nThen, rows 4 and 5: two songs with \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nThe claim says only one of the song from the dead guy remix be not in 2003. So, among the dead guys remix songs, only one should not be in 2003.\n\nBut looking at the dead guys remix group:\n\n- Rows 0,1,2: all 2003\n- Row 3: 2005\n\nSo that's four songs. Wait, row 3 is 2005, which is not 2003, so that's one song not in 2003.\n\nThen, are there any others? The claim says only one, meaning among the dead guys remix, only row 3 (2005) is not 2003. So, all others should be 2003.\n\nBut wait, in rows 4 and 5, the remix is \"dee - lux remix,\" so they're different from dead guys remix. Therefore, those shouldn't be considered for this claim because it's only about the dead guys remix.\n\nSo, among the dead guys remix (rows 0-3), only row 3 is not in 2003. So that's one song.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003\" would mean that among all the songs that have a dead guys remix, exactly one is not in 2003. Which is true because rows 0-2 are 2003, row 3 is 2005 (one), and then rows 4-5 are different.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"the song from the remix dead guy remix,\" which refers to all songs with that specific remix, regardless of year. So among those four, only one is not in 2003.\n\nTherefore, the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one song with a \"dead guys remix\" is not from the year 2003. Examining the table, three songs have this remix in 2003, one in 2005, and none of the others are part of this remix category. Thus, exactly one song (\"can't resist\" by Texas) is not from 2003, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about this table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"only 1 of the artist list from the remix dead guy remix have the name of a state.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is referring to. It mentions \"artist list from the remix dead guy remix.\" Looking at the table, each row has an 'artist' and a 'remix' column. The remixes listed are either \"dead guys remix\" or \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nSo, I think the relevant part here is the 'artist' column where their name includes \"dead guys remix\" or \"dee - lux remix.\" But wait, actually, the 'remix' column has those names, not the artist's name. So perhaps the claim is referring to the artists whose songs were remixed by someone named \"dead guys\" or another person, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse it differently. The claim says \"artist list from the remix dead guy remix.\" So for each row where the 'remix' column contains \"dead guys remix,\" we look at the corresponding artist name and check if any of those names correspond to a U.S. state's name.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Artist is Blondie, Remix is dead guys remix.\nRow 1: Artist is Chican\u00e9, Remix is dead guys remix.\nRow 2: Artist is Lamb, Remix is dead guys remix.\nRow 3: Artist is Texas, Remix is dead guys remix.\nRow 4: Artist is Pixie Lott, Remix is dee - lux remix.\nRow 5: Artist is Perry Mystique, Remix is dee - lux remix.\n\nSo the relevant 'remix' column entries are rows 0-3 for \"dead guys remix\" and rows 4-5 for \"dee - lux remix.\" \n\nThe claim says only one of these artists has a name that's the name of a U.S. state. So I need to check each artist whose song was remixed by either dead guys or dee - lux.\n\nFirst, let's list out the artists:\n\nBlondie (row 0), Chican\u00e9 (row1), Lamb (row2), Texas (row3), Pixie Lott (row4), Perry Mystique (row5).\n\nNow, check if any of these are names of U.S. states.\n\n- Blondie: Not a state.\n- Chican\u00e9: Not a state. Chican\u00e9 is a person's name, not a state.\n- Lamb: Not a state.\n- Texas: Yes! There is a state named Texas.\n- Pixie Lott: No.\n- Perry Mystique: No.\n\nSo, only Texas in row3 has an artist name that matches a U.S. state.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"only 1\" of these has a state's name, which is true because Texas is one and the others are not.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if any other artists might be states. For example, is Perry Mystique a state? No, that doesn't make sense. Same with the rest.\n\nSo, only Texas meets the condition. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that among artists whose songs were remixed by \"dead guys remix\" or \"dee - lux remix,\" only one has a name corresponding to a U.S. state. Checking each artist:\n\n- Blondie: Not a state.\n- Chican\u00e9: Not a state.\n- Lamb: Not a state.\n- Texas: Yes, it's a state.\n- Pixie Lott: Not a state.\n- Perry Mystique: Not a state.\n\nOnly Texas fits, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"artist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 1 single song that be produce after 2003 that do not have an album title list.\"\n\nHmm, I need to parse this. It seems like it's saying there's one song produced after 2003 without an album listed in the table. Wait, looking at the table columns, we have year, artist, song, album, and remix.\n\nSo, first, the song must be produced after 2003. That means I should look at rows where year > 2003, which would be 2010 and onwards. Let me check the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nIn 2010:\n- pixie lott: \"turn it up\", album is \"turn it up\"\n- perry mystique: \"party like ur 18 feat sway\", album is listed as N/A (no album)\n\nWait, so for perry mystique's song in 2010, the album is listed as N/A. So that might be relevant because the claim mentions a song without an album title list.\n\nNow, the claim says \"do not have an album title list.\" In the table, the 'album' column has N/A for perry mystique. That suggests that the album isn't listed, so maybe this is the single song in question.\n\nSo, I need to see if there's exactly one such song after 2003 without an album. Let me check all rows where year > 2003 and album is N/A or missing.\n\nLooking at 2010:\n- pixie lott: album listed\n- perry mystique: album is N/A\n\nSo only one song, \"party like ur 18 feat sway\" by perry mystique in 2010 has an N/A in the album column. That fits the claim of having exactly one such song.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be the row for perry mystique's entry in 2010. Specifically, looking at the columns: song and album.\n\nWait, but the claim is about a song that does not have an album title list. So the 'album' column is where that information is. Therefore, the relevant columns are 'song' (to identify which song) and 'album' (to check if it's listed or not).\n\nSo, for perry mystique in 2010, row index 5, the columns to consider would be 'album'.\n\nBut let me double-check: does any other row beyond 2003 have a missing album? The next year is 2010, and after that, there are no more rows. So only one song, \"party like ur 18 feat sway,\" has an N/A in the album.\n\nThus, the claim is true because there's exactly one such song, and it doesn't list an album title.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has columns: year, artist, song, album, and remix. Each row represents a different song with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"dee - lux remix\" in two rows: 2010 for both pixie lott's \"turn it up\" and perry mystique's \"party like ur 18 feat sway\". So I need to check those rows where the remix is \"dee - lux remix\".\n\nLooking at row 5 (index 5): \n- Year is 2010, artist is pixie lott, song is \"turn it up\", album is \"turn it up\", and remix is \"dee - lux remix\". \n\nRow 6 (index 6):\n- Year is 2010, artist is perry mystique, song is \"party like ur 18 feat sway\", album is \"n / a\", and remix is \"dee - lux remix\".\n\nSo both these songs have the same year, which is 2010.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" Hmm, okay, so I need to look into the table provided and check each relevant cell.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about songs by an artist named 'dee - lux' where only one of them isn't from the year 2005. Looking at the table, I see that in 2010, there are two entries for 'dee - lux remix'. \n\nSo, let me break this down. In the 'remix' column, I'm looking for any entry with \"dee - lux\". From the table:\n\n- For the row where year is 2010 and artist is pixie lott, the remix is dee - lux.\n- For the row where year is 2010 and artist is perry mystique, the remix is also dee - lux.\n\nWait, so both of these are from 2010, but the claim says \"not in 2005.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 'dee - lux' remixed songs for both 2003 and 2005, right? Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the 'artist' column for the 'dee - lux remix' entries:\n\n- In 2003, the artists are blondie, chicane, and lamb.\n- In 2005, the artist is texas.\n- In 2010, it's pixie lott and perry mystique.\n\nSo, in 2005, there's only one 'dee - lux remix' for the artist texas. Therefore, any song by 'dee - lux' from 2003 or 2010 would have been remixed by them. But the claim is specifically about whether only one of these songs isn't in 2005.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" That wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it means that among the 'dee - lux' remixes, only one is not from 2005. So, how many 'dee - lux' remixed songs are there?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 2003, all three artists (blondie, chicane, lamb) had a 'dead guys remix', which I think is different from 'dee - lux'. Wait, no: in 2010, pixie lott's song has 'dee - lux' as the remix. Similarly, perry mystique's also has 'dee - lux'.\n\nWait, so perhaps the claim is saying that only one of the songs by 'dee - lux' isn't from 2005. But looking at the table, all 'dee - lux remixes' are either in 2010 or 2003 and 2005.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse it again: \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" So, among the songs that have a 'dee - lux' remix, only one is not in 2005. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 2010, two songs have 'dee - lux' remix: pixie lott and perry mystique.\n- In 2003, none of the 'dee - lux' remixed songs are listed, but I think that's because maybe they weren't used in 2003? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the 'remix' column for 2003 entries is 'dead guys remix', and for 2010 it's 'dee - lux'. So, perhaps the claim is referring to all songs that have a 'dee - lux' as their remix. Those are two in 2010 and one in 2005 (texas). Wait no, in 2005, the artist is texas with 'dead guys remix' or 'dee - lux'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- For 2003: blondie, chicane, lamb have 'dead guys remix'.\n- For 2005: texas has 'dead guys remix'.\nWait, no: looking closer:\n\nWait, in 2010, pixie lott's song has 'dee - lux remix' and perry mystique's also has 'dee - lux remix'.\n\nIn 2003, the remixed songs are 'dead guys remix', so that's different. So, 'dee - lux' is only involved in 2010.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" So, perhaps it's referring to all songs with 'dee - lux' as the remix. Those would be:\n\n- In 2010: pixie lott and perry mystique (so two songs)\n- In 2003: None, since they have 'dead guys remix'.\n\nWait, but in 2005, is there a song with 'dee - lux'? No, because in 2005, the artist is texas and the remix is 'dead guys'. So, only in 2010 are there two songs with 'dee - lux' as the remix.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" Wait, that would mean that among the 'dee - lux' remixed songs, one is not from 2005. But all 'dee - lux' remixed songs are either from 2010 or perhaps none.\n\nWait, no, in 2003, there were no 'dee - lux' remixes; they had 'dead guys'. So, the 'dee - lux' remixed songs start in 2010. Therefore, both of them (pixie lott and perry mystique) are from 2010, which is not 2005.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" That would mean that one of them isn't in 2005, but actually both are in 2010, so neither is in 2005. So the statement seems incorrect because it implies only one, but in reality, there are two.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is saying that among all 'dee - lux' remixed songs, only one is not from 2005. But all 'dee - lux' remixed songs are in 2010, so both are not in 2005. Therefore, the statement would be false because it claims only one is not in 2005, but actually two are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which columns to look at. Let me see: the claim refers to 'songs from the dee - lux', so perhaps looking at the 'song' column for 'dee - lux'? But no, the song titles are specific to each artist. The relevant part is the 'remix' column.\n\nSo, in the table, the 'remix' column has entries. We need to look at rows where remix is 'dee - lux'.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- 2010: pixie lott's \"turn it up\" has 'dee - lux remix'.\n- 2010: perry mystique's song also has 'dee - lux remix'.\n\nSo, two songs have 'dee - lux' as the remix. The claim says only one of these is not in 2005. But both are in 2010, so neither is in 2005. Therefore, both are not in 2005, which contradicts the claim's statement that only one is not.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting again. Perhaps the claim is saying that among all 'dee - lux' remixes, only one song isn't from 2005. But since both are in 2010, neither is in 2005, so actually two songs aren't in 2005. So the statement is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look at when the remix was applied? Or perhaps the original song's release year?\n\nWait, no, the data given is just about each song's details: artist, title, year (I assume), and remix.\n\nBut since the 'year' isn't specified in the table, perhaps it's inferred from the context. Maybe 2003 is when the 'dead guys remix' was used, and 2010 for 'dee - lux'.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then all 'dee - lux' remixed songs are from 2010, so none are from 2005.\n\nThus, the claim says only one is not in 2005. But actually, both are not. So the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be that the statement is incorrect because two songs have 'dee - lux' remixes and neither is from 2005.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005\" is incorrect. \n\nAnalysis:\n- In the provided table, the \"remix\" column shows that there are two songs with \"dee - lux\" as their remix: one by pixie lott and another by perry mystique.\n- Both of these songs are from the year 2010, according to typical context where such remixes might be associated with more recent releases.\n- Since both \"dee - lux\" remixed songs are from 2010, neither is from the year 2005.\n- The original statement implies that only one song does not belong to 2005. However, in reality, two songs do not belong to 2005.\n\nConclusion:\nThe claim is false because there are actually two songs with \"dee - lux\" remixes, both of which are not from the year 2005. \n\n**Final Answer:** The statement is incorrect; there are two songs that do not belong to 2005.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state.\" So, I'm looking for artists in the 'remix' column that are named after U.S. states. But wait, actually, the claim is specifically about the 'dee - lux remix' row. Wait no, the 'remix' column has values like 'dead guys remix' and 'dee - lux remix.' So the 'dee - lux remix' artists might be associated with state names.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 2003, there are three entries: blondie, chicane, lamb. Their remixes are all 'dead guys remix.'\n- In 2005, Texas is listed as an artist, and their remix is 'dead guys remix.'\n- In 2010, pixie lott and perry mystique have remixes of 'dee - lux remix' and another with a different remix.\n\nSo the 'dee - lux remix' appears in two rows: one for pixie lott and another for perry mystique. Now, I need to check if any of these artists are named after U.S. states.\n\nLooking at the 'artist' column:\n\n- blondie: Doesn't seem like a state.\n- chicane: Not a state.\n- lamb: No.\n- texas: Yes, Texas is a state.\n- pixie lott: No, she's a person, not a state.\n- perry mystique: Hmm, Perry could refer to the capital of Texas, but 'mystique' doesn't make it a state. Maybe it's referring to Perry as a last name, which isn't a state.\n\nWait, wait. The claim is about the artists in the 'dee - lux remix' row(s). So in 2010, both pixie lott and perry mystique have that remix. Now, do any of these artist names correspond to U.S. states? Texas is one, but it's under a different remix ('dead guys'). The other two don't seem to be states.\n\nWait, let me double-check the 'artist' column:\n\n- 2003: blondie, chicane, lamb\n- 2005: texas\n- 2010: pixie lott, perry mystique\n\nSo, Texas is one state name as an artist. Now, for the 'dee - lux remix,' are there any other artists that are U.S. states? Looking at the 'artist' column in rows where the remix is 'dee - lux':\n\n- 2010: pixie lott and perry mystique.\n\nNeither of these names corresponds to a U.S. state as far as I know. So, the only artist that's a state is Texas, which has a different remix. Therefore, only one artist (Texas) in the entire table matches the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state.\" So it's specifically about the 'dee - lux remix' entries.\n\nIn that case, looking at the rows where the remix is 'dee - lux remix,' we have two artists: pixie lott and perry mystique. Neither of these are states, so does that mean zero artists in the 'dee - lux remix' satisfy the condition? But the claim says \"only 1,\" which would be false if none.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe claim: \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state.\"\n\nSo it's considering all artists in the 'dee - lux remix' column. Looking back at the table, the 'remix' column has two entries for 'dee - lux remix,' both in 2010: pixie lott and perry mystique.\n\nSo, among these two, are any named after states? Texas is a state, but it's not under 'dee - lux remix.' So, zero artists in the 'dee - lux remix' have names that are U.S. states.\n\nThus, the claim is saying only 1 does, which would be false because none do. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding which rows to consider. Let me clarify:\n\nThe table has a 'remix' column with various remix names. The claim refers specifically to artists in the 'dee - lux remix' row(s). So, it's about all artists who have that particular remix.\n\nIn 2010, both pixie lott and perry mystique are associated with 'dee - lux remix.' Neither of these names correspond to a U.S. state. Therefore, none of them meet the condition in the claim. Since the claim states \"only 1\" does, which would be incorrect because zero do. So the answer is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Are any of the artists' names actual state names? For example, 'Texas' is a state, but it's under a different remix. 'Pixie Lott' and 'Perry Mystique' don't correspond to states. So yes, zero in the 'dee - lux remix' entries are states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there aren't any artists in the 'dee - lux remix' whose names are states.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the table reveals that none of the artists under the \"dee - lux remix\" have names corresponding to U.S. states. Since the claim asserts only one such artist exists, it is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remix\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 1 single artist that be produce after 2005 that have an album title list.\" Hmm, that seems a bit off grammatically, but I think it's meant to say something like \"there is 1 single artist who produced an album after 2005 with an album title list.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, artist, song, album, and remix. The years range from 2003 to 2010.\n\nI need to check if there's exactly one artist in this table that released an album after 2005. Also, I should make sure that the album title is listed correctly or perhaps that it exists. Wait, maybe \"album title list\" refers to having a specific album name, but looking at the table structure, the 'album' column lists the album names.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Identify all artists who released albums after 2005.\n2. Check if only one such artist has an entry in the table where their album is listed as part of their record.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 2003: blondie, chicane, lamb\n- 2005: texas\n- 2010: pixie lott, perry mystique\n\nSo after 2005 (i.e., 2006 onwards), the artists are texas (2005), pixie lott and perry mystique (both 2010).\n\nWait, 2005 is included because it's after or including 2005? The claim says \"after 2005,\" so maybe starting from 2006. So let's clarify:\n\n- 2005: if the year is 2005, is that considered \"after\" 2005? Probably not; it's more like in 2005 or later.\n\nSo considering 2005 and beyond. But I think the user might mean after 2005, so starting from 2006. So let me check:\n\n- 2003: blondie, chicane, lamb\n- 2005: texas\n- 2010: pixie lott, perry mystique\n\nIf we consider \"after 2005,\" then only 2010 is relevant.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table. The claim says \"there be 1 single artist that be produce after 2005 that have an album title list.\"\n\nSo I think the claim is saying that there is exactly one artist who produced an album after 2005, and that album has a title listed.\n\nLooking at the artists after 2005:\n\n- pixie lott: released \"turn it up\" in 2010, with the album also named \"turn it up.\"\n- perry mystique: their album is listed as \"n / a,\" which might mean not available or unknown. So maybe their album title isn't listed.\n\nTexas released \"red book\" in 2005. Since 2005 is after 2005? Or is it considered as being produced after 2005? If 2005 counts, then we have texas (2005), pixie lott and perry mystique (2010). That would be three artists, which contradicts the claim of one artist.\n\nBut if \"after 2005\" means strictly after 2005 (i.e., 2006 onwards), then only pixie lott and perry mystique in 2010. Again, that's two artists.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 single artist.\" So if it's exactly one, let's see:\n\nLooking for an artist who produced an album after 2005, with their album title listed.\n\nIn the table, pixie lott has an album called \"turn it up,\" which is in the album column. Perry mystique's album is listed as \"n / a.\" So maybe only pixie lott qualifies.\n\nBut wait, texas released \"red book\" in 2005. If we include 2005, then that's another artist (texas) who produced an album after 2005 with their album title listed. That would be two artists: texas and pixie lott.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is looking for one artist who produced an album after 2005, regardless of the year they released other works, maybe it's just looking for any single instance where an artist released an album after 2005 with a title list.\n\nBut let me re-examine the table:\n\nLooking at each row and their years:\n\n- Blondie: 2003\n- Chican\u00e9: 2003\n- Lamb: 2003\n- Texas: 2005\n- Pixie Lott: 2010\n- Perry Mystique: 2010\n\nSo, after 2005, we have Texas (2005), Pixie Lott (2010), and Perry Mystique (2010).\n\nNow, for each of these artists:\n\n- Texas: album is \"red book,\" which exists.\n- Pixie Lott: album is \"turn it up.\"\n- Perry Mystique: album is listed as \"n / a.\"\n\nSo if the claim refers to having an album title list, then Perry's album isn't listed (or perhaps it's just not available), so only Texas and Pixie Lott have their albums listed.\n\nBut the claim says \"1 single artist.\" So that would be FALSE because there are two artists (Texas and Pixie Lott) who have albums after 2005 with title lists.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check each relevant cell.\n\nThe table has columns: year, artist, song, album, remix.\n\nWe need to find if there is exactly one artist where the year is after 2005 and their album is listed in the table.\n\nLooking at rows with years >2005:\n\n- 2010: pixie lott (album: turn it up)\n- 2010: perry mystique (album: n/a)\n\nSo only two artists, both in 2010. Therefore, there are two artists after 2005 with albums listed.\n\nThus, the claim is stating that there's only one such artist, which would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me count again:\n\nTotal artists after 2005 (assuming 2005 is included):\n\n1. Texas: 2005\n2. Pixie Lott: 2010\n3. Perry Mystique: 2010\n\nSo that's three artists, but their albums are:\n\n- Texas: red book (included)\n- Pixie Lott: turn it up (included)\n- Perry Mystique: n/a (not included)\n\nIf the claim is about having an album title list, then only Texas and Pixie have valid album titles. So that's two artists, which again contradicts the claim of one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}]}",

Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe table has several columns: year, artist, song, album, and remix. There are five rows of data.\n\nThe claim says: \"the song from the dee - lux remix be preform by the same art and the song be from different year.\"\n\nWait, I think there might be a typo in the claim.

These songs are from different years.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all rows where the remix is \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- In 2010, there are two entries with this remix:\n  - Row 4: song \"turn it up\" by pixie lott\n  - Row 5: song \"party like ur 18 feat sway\" by perry mystique\n\nNow, check if these songs have the same artist.\n\nRow 4: Artist is pixie lott.\nRow 5: Artist is perry mystique.\n\nSince these are different artists (pixie lott vs. perry mystique), the first part of the claim is not true because they aren't performed by the same artist.
