The key elements here are:\n\n1. **tournament location**: \"indian well\"\n2. **date**: \"8 march 1992\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament with details like outcome (winner or runner-up), date, tournament name, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nI'll start by searching for the tournament named \"indian wells\" in the 'tournament' column. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: florence\n- Row 1: wellington\n- Row 2: sydney\n- Row 3: orlando\n- Row 4: toulouse\n- Row 5: nice\n- Row 6: munich\n- Row 7: auckland\n- Row 8: monte carlo\n- Row 9: rome\n- Row 10: tel aviv\n- Row 11: montreal\n- Row 12: indian wells\n\nYes, row index 12 has \"indian wells\" as the tournament.\n\nNow, check the date for this specific tournament. The 'date' column for row 12 is \"8 march 1992.\"\n\nComparing this to the claim's date, it matches exactly (\"8 march 1992\").\n\nSo both the tournament name and the date align perfectly with one of the table rows.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier be the opponent in the match that be play in nice on a clay court.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see what each column represents. The columns are outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row is a different match with details filled in those columns.\n\nThe claim mentions three main things: j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier being the opponent, the location being nice on a clay court. So I need to find a match where the tournament is \"nice,\" the surface is clay, and the opponent is j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier.\n\nLooking through the table row by row:\n\n1. The first few rows don't have the tournament as \"nice.\" For example, row 0 has \"florence,\" row 1 \"wellington,\" etc.\n2. Scanning further down, I see a row where the tournament is \"nice.\" Let me check: yes, there's a row with tournament \"nice\" and date \"24 april 1989.\" The opponent in that row is listed as \"j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier.\"\n3. So this seems to match exactly what the claim states. The opponent is j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier, the tournament is nice, and the surface is clay.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything else. Is there another match in Nice? No, only one row has \"nice.\" Also, the surface for that row is clay, which matches the claim's description.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by this particular row. There's no contradiction or missing information here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier was the opponent in a match held in Nice on a clay court.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding exactly what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the score of the tournament in wellington be 7 - 6 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 3 - 6\". \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any entry that matches this description. The table has multiple columns: outcome (which can be winner or runner-up), date, tournament name, surface type, opponent's name, and the score.\n\nI need to check each row in the table to see if there's a match for the tournament being \"wellington\" with the specified scores. \n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row is about the winner in Florence on clay against Alessandro de minicis, with scores 6-1 and 6-3. Not relevant.\n\n2. The second row is about a runner-up in Wellington on hardcourt against Ramesh Krishnan, but the scores are 7-6, 0-6, 4-6, 3-6. Wait, that's exactly what the claim mentions! So it seems like this row matches the claim.\n\nBut I should make sure there are no other rows with the same tournament name and scores. Let me continue checking:\n\n3. Third row: runner-up in Sydney on grass against John Fitzgerald, scores 3-6 and 4-6. Not matching.\n\n4. Fourth row: winner in Orlando on hardcourt against Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 with scores 7-6 (8-6) and 6-1. Doesn't match.\n\n5. Fifth row: runner-up in Toulouse on hardcourt against Jimmy Connors, scores 2-6 and 0-6. Not matching.\n\n6. Sixth row: winner in Nice on clay against J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier with scores 6-4 and 6-4. No.\n\n7. Seventh row: winner in Munich on clay against Martin St\u0159elba, scores 5-7, 7-6 (8-6), and 6-2. Doesn't match.\n\n8. Eighth row: runner-up in Auckland on hardcourt against Scott Davis with scores 6-4, 3-6, 3-6. Not the same as the claim's score.\n\n9. Ninth row: winner in Monte Carlo on clay against Thomas Muster, scores 7-5, 6-3, 6-3. Doesn't match.\n\n10. Tenth row: runner-up in Rome on clay against Thomas Muster with scores 1-6, 3-6, 1-6. No.\n\n11. Eleventh row: winner in Tel Aviv on hardcourt against Amos Mansdorf, scores 6-4 and 6-3. Doesn't match.\n\n12. Twelfth row: winner in Montreal on hardcourt against Petr Korda with scores 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. Not matching.\n\n13. Thirteenth row: runner-up in Indian Wells on hardcourt against Michael Chang with scores 3-6, 4-6, and 5-7. No match.\n\n14. Fourteenth row: runner-up in Hamburg on clay against Michael Stich with multiple scores, but the opponent is Michael Stich, not Ramesh Krishnan. So even if the scores matched, it's a different opponent.\n\n15. Fifteenth row: runner-up in Prague on clay against Sergi Bruguera with scores 5-7 and 4-6. Doesn't match.\n\nSo from this analysis, only one row matches both the tournament name \"wellington\" and the exact score mentioned in the claim. That is the second row where the outcome is runner-up, date January 3, 1988, against Ramesh Krishnan with those specific scores.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE based on this single matching row.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about the tournament score in Wellington is accurate, we analyze each relevant row in the table. The claim specifies that the score should be \"7 - 6 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 3 - 6\" for the Wellington tournament. \n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Second row**: Runner-up in Wellington on hardcourt against Ramesh Krishnan with scores matching exactly.\n  \nNo other rows match both the tournament name and the specified score.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier be the opponent in the match that be play in Wellington on 24 April 1989 on a surface of hardcourt.\" I notice some grammatical issues here\u2014like \"that be play\" and \"surface of hardcourt.\" But focusing on the content, the key elements are:\n\n1. **Opponent**: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier.\n2. **Match location**: Wellington.\n3. **Date**: 24 April 1989.\n4. **Surface**: Hardcourt.\n\nNow, I'll look at each of these elements in the table to see if they align with the claim.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find a match where all these conditions are met: opponent is J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier, location is Wellington, date is 24 April 1989, and surface is hardcourt.\n\nStarting with the date, I'll scan each row for \"24 April 1989.\" Scanning down:\n\n- Row 0: 25 May 1987\n- Row 1: 3 January 1988\n- Row 2: 10 January 1988\n- Row 3: 14 March 1988\n- Row 4: 16 October 1988\n- Row 5: 24 April 1989\n- ...\n\nOkay, row 5 has the date 24 April 1989. Now, checking the location for this row. The 'tournament' column in row 5 is \"nice.\" So the match was played in Nice, not Wellington. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there's another match on 24 April 1989 in Wellington. Let me go through each row again to see if any other rows have that date and location.\n\nContinuing the scan:\n\n- Row 6: 8 May 1989 (opponent is Martin St\u0159elba)\n- Row 7: 14 January 1990\n- Row 8: 30 April 1990\n- Row 9: 20 May 1990\n- Row 10: 15 October 1990\n- Row 11: 29 July 1991\n- Row 12: 8 March 1992\n- Row 13: 9 May 1993\n- Row 14: 8 August 1993\n\nNone of these rows have the date 24 April 1989 except row 5. So, only row 5 matches the date and surface (clay) but not the location.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the 'tournament' column for row 5. Let me check again. The 'tournament' is \"nice,\" so it's in Nice, not Wellington.\n\nNow, checking if there's any match where the opponent is J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier, date is 24 April 1989, and location is Wellington. From the table provided, I don't see such a row. All matches on that date are in different locations: row 5 is in Nice, others around that time are in January or March.\n\nWait, could there be another match where J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier was the opponent? Let me check each row's 'opponent' column:\n\n- Row 0: Alessandro de minicis\n- Row 1: Ramesh Krishnan\n- Row 2: John Fitzgerald\n- Row 3: Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159\n- Row 4: Jimmy Connors\n- Row 5: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier\n- Row 6: Martin St\u0159elba\n- Row 7: Scott Davis\n- Row 8: Thomas Muster\n- Row 9: Thomas Muster\n- Row 10: Amos Mansdorf\n- Row 11: Petr Korda\n- Row 12: Michael Chang\n- Row 13: Michael Stich\n- Row 14: Sergi Bruguera\n\nOnly row 5 has J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier as the opponent, and that match was on 24 April 1989 in Nice, not Wellington. So there's no match where all the claim's criteria are met.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Could there be another occurrence of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier that I didn't consider? From the table, it seems he only appears once as an opponent on 24 April 1989 in Nice.\n\nTherefore, since none of the matches meet all three criteria (opponent, date, and location), the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"tournament\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the tournament in indian well on 8 march 1992 be play on a clay surface.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be verified. The key points are:\n\n1. **Tournament location**: Indian Wells\n2. **Date**: 8 March 1992\n3. **Surface type**: Clay\n\nNext, I'll look at the table to find any entries that match these criteria.\n\nLooking through the rows one by one:\n\n- Row 0: outcome is winner, date May 25 1987, tournament Florence, surface clay... Doesn't match.\n- Row 1: runner-up, date Jan 3 1988, tournament Wellington, hardcourt... No.\n- Row 2: runner-up, Jan 10 1988, Sydney, grass... Not matching.\n- Row 3: winner, March 14 1988, Orlando, hardcourt... Doesn't match.\n- Row 4: runner-up, Oct 16 1988, Toulouse, hardcourt... No.\n- Row 5: winner, April 24 1989, Nice, clay...

No.\n- Row 8: winner, April 30 1990, Monte Carlo, clay... Different tournament and date.\n- Row 9: runner-up, May 20 1990, Rome, clay... Not the same as Indian Wells or date.\n- Row 10: winner, Oct 15 1990, Tel Aviv, hardcourt... Doesn't match.\n- Row 11: winner, July 29 1991, Montreal, hardcourt... Different location and surface? Wait, the claim says clay. So this is a winner on a hardcourt, which doesn't match.\n- Row 12: runner-up, March 8 1992, Indian Wells, hardcourt... Here's the tournament name and date. But the surface here is hardcourt, not clay. The claim says it was played on clay, so this row might be relevant but doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check row 12 again. It says the tournament is Indian Wells on March 8, 1992, and the surface is hardcourt. So if the claim is about a clay surface, then this row's surface is hardcourt, which contradicts the claim. But wait, the claim says \"play on a clay surface,\" but in the table, that specific match was on hardcourt.\n\nSo does any other row match? Let me keep checking all rows to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- Row 13: runner-up, May 9 1993, Hamburg, clay... Different date.\n- Row 14: runner-up, Aug 8 1993, Prague, clay... Also different date and tournament.\n\nWait, so in row 12, the tournament is Indian Wells on March 8, 1992. But the surface there was hardcourt. The claim says it was played on a clay surface. Therefore, this specific cell (row 12) doesn't support the claim because the surface is not clay but hardcourt.\n\nWait, did I get that right? Let me check row 12 again. Yes, it's March 8, 1992, Indian Wells, and the surface is hardcourt. So in the table, there's no match on March 8, 1992, in Indian Wells with a clay surface.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I misread. Let me look for any rows where tournament is Indian Wells, date is March 8, 1992. Yes, row 12 is that. Surface is hardcourt. So the claim says it was played on clay, but the table shows it was on hardcourt. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"Indian well\" is a typo in the claim. In the table, it's \"Indian Wells.\" The claim says \"indian well,\" which might be a different location or perhaps a typo. So maybe the tournament was not Indian Well but Indian Wells. But regardless, in the table, there is no match with those exact parameters that supports the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at all rows. Let me go through each row again quickly:\n\nLooking for:\n\n- Tournament: \"Indian Wells\"\n\n- Date: March 8, 1992\n\nSurface: Clay\n\nFrom the table, let's see:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 14.\n\nLooking for tournament column where it says \"Indian Wells\":\n\nLooking at each row's tournament name:\n\nRow 12: Indian Wells\n\nOthers: row 7 is Auckland, row 11 is Montreal, etc. Only row 12 matches both the tournament and date.\n\nNow, surface in that row: hardcourt.\n\nSo the surface doesn't match the claim of clay.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is row 12 (row index 12), column \"surface.\"\n\nWait, but the table's \"surface\" for row 12 is \"hardcourt,\" which contradicts the claim. So the claim says it was on a clay surface, but the table shows hardcourt.\n\nThus, to support the claim, there needs to be a match where tournament is Indian Wells, date March 8, 1992, and surface is clay. But none of the rows have all three matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, no row in the table supports the claim that on March 8, 1992, in Indian Wells, it was played on a clay surface; instead, it's hardcourt.\n\nSo the conclusion is that there is no entry in the table that matches the claim. Therefore, the task requires identifying which rows are relevant, and even though only row 12 partially matches (tournament and date), the surface doesn't align with the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the dates: March 8, 1992, vs. other entries. Let me check:\n\nLooking at each row's date:\n\nRow 0: May 25, 1987\n\nRow1: Jan 3, 1988\n\nRow2: Jan 10, 1988\n\n...\n\nRow12: March 8, 1992\n\nYes, only row12 matches the tournament and date. So if we're to consider which rows are relevant to the claim, row12 is the one because it's the only one with those two attributes.\n\nBut since its surface is hardcourt, not clay, it doesn't support the claim. Therefore, perhaps there are no supporting rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task is to find any row that has a match for at least tournament or date, but in this case, only row12 matches both. But because it doesn't have the correct surface, it doesn't back the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express:\n\nThe task says: You are tasked with identifying which rows provide evidence for the claim that \"On March 8, 1992, in Indian Wells, a tennis match was played on a clay surface.\"\n\nSo, to determine if any row matches all three aspects: tournament name (Indian Wells), date (March 8, 1992), and surface (clay).\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow12 has the tournament as \"Indian Wells\" and date March 8, 1992, but surface is hardcourt. Therefore, it doesn't match the surface condition.\n\nSo no rows fully support all three aspects of the claim.\n\nBut perhaps the task only requires matching two: name and date? Or maybe just name.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know if there's any row that matches either or both attributes, but not necessarily all. But I think for evidence of a specific claim, all criteria must match.\n\nSo in this case, none of the rows support the claim because the surface doesn't align.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that no data supports the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and overlooked another row. Let me check again quickly:\n\nLooking at each row's tournament name:\n\nRow12: Indian Wells\n\nRow7: Auckland\n\nRow10: Tel Aviv\n\nRow11: Montreal\n\nOthers don't match.\n\nSo only row12 is in consideration, but as mentioned, the surface is hardcourt.\n\nTherefore, there is no data supporting the claim. Hence, the answer is that no rows provide evidence for the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the table reveals that no data supports the claim that a tennis match was played on March 8, 1992, in Indian Wells on a clay surface. The only matching row describes the surface as hardcourt.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nNo rows in the provided table support the claim that a tennis match was played on March 8, 1992, in Indian Wells on a clay surface.",

Here are all the opponents listed:\n\n1. Alessandro de minicis\n2. Ramesh krishnan\n3. John Fitzgerald\n4. Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159\n5. Jimmy Connors\n6. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Potier\n7. Martin St\u0159elba\n8. Scott Davis\n9. Thomas Muster\n10. Amos Mansdorf\n11. Petr Korda\n12. Michael Chang\n13. Michael Stich\n14. Sergi Bruguera\n\nOkay, I see that the 14th row has Sergi Bruguera as the opponent. So this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, let's look at the score for that match. According to the table, against Sergi Bruguera, the score is \"5 - 7 , 4 - 6\". Wait a minute, but the claim says the score should be \"5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 5 - 7\". That doesn't match.\n\nWait, let me check again. The table shows for the runner-up on 8 August 1993 in Prague against Sergi Bruguera: the score is 5-7 and 4-6. So that's two sets: first set 5-7, second set 4-6. The claim mentions three scores: 5-7, 6-4, and another 5-7. That implies three sets, perhaps a tiebreak situation.\n\nLooking at the table, in other rows, sometimes there are tiebreak scores, like \"6 - 1 (8 - 6)\", which is an extra point or something. But in this particular row for Sergi Bruguera, it's only two scores: 5-7 and 4-6. There's no third set mentioned.\n\nSo the claim is stating that the score was three sets with specific results, but the table shows only two sets. Therefore, the claim doesn't match the actual score in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the scores are presented. Maybe the user meant a single score line with 5-7 and then another 6-4, but that still wouldn't make three separate scores unless it's a three-setter. However, the table only lists two scores for that match.\n\nWait, maybe the table was transcribed incorrectly, or I'm miscounting. Let me check again. The row in question is:\n\nrunner - up | 8 august 1993   | prague       | clay      | sergi bruguera        | 5 - 7 , 4 - 6                                 |\n\nYes, so the score is two scores: first set 5-7 and second set 4-6. So the claim's score is three sets: 5-7, 6-4, 5-7. That doesn't align with what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states a different score than what's actually recorded for that match. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the score against Sergi Bruguera does not match the actual score listed in the table. The table shows a score of 5-7 and 4-6, which is two sets, whereas the claim states three sets with scores 5-7, 6-4, and another 5-7.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:** Find the row where the opponent is Sergi Bruguera.\n2. **Check the Score:** Compare the score in that row to the claim.\n3. **Determine Match:** The score does not match, so the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the table provided. The claim states: \"the score in the tournament in [tel aviv] be 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 and the match be win by amos mansdorf.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need to be verified from the table. The claim mentions two things: the score and the winner. Therefore, I'll need to check both the 'score' and 'opponent' columns for the specific tournament in Tel Aviv.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the 'tournament' column is \"tel aviv.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Line 15: outcome is winner, date 15 october 1990, tournament tel aviv, surface hardcourt, opponent amos mansdorf, score 6 -4 , 6 -3.\n\nSo, this row directly corresponds to both parts of the claim. The score matches exactly as stated (6-4 and 6-3), and the winner is amos mansdorf, which aligns with the claim.\n\nI should also ensure that there's no other row for Tel Aviv that might contradict this. Checking through each tournament name, only one entry has \"tel aviv,\" so it's clear that this is the correct row to reference.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
