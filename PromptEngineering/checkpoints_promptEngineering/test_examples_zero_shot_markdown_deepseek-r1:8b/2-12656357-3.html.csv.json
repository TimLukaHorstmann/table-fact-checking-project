    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Ireland only scoring 1 silver medal and no other medals is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate where Ireland is in the table. Scanning through the list of nations: Albania, Algeria, Austria... wait, actually, looking at the table, I see a row for Ireland. The row index for Ireland would be important here because it helps me pinpoint exactly which data to look at.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a nation. So, for Ireland, let's find its position. Going through each row:\n\n1. Russia\n2. Ukraine\n3. Kazakhstan\n4. Belarus\n5. China\n6. Germany\n7. Australia\n8. Turkey\n9. Morocco\n10. Thailand\n11. Finland\n12. Poland\n13. South Africa\n14. Great Britain\n15. Latvia\n16. Egypt\n17. South Korea\n18. North Korea\n19. Cuba\n20. Lithuania\n21. Algeria\n22. Austria\n23. Bulgaria\n24. Iran\n25. Portugal\n26. Japan\n27. Belgium\n28. Brazil\n29. Uganda\n30. Chinese Taipei\n31. Italy\n32. Croatia\n33. Cyprus\n34. Ireland\n35. Kenya\n36. Mozambique\n37. Romania\n38. Slovakia\n39. Spain\n40. Czech Republic\n41. Canada\n42. Estonia\n43. Greece\n44. Moldova\n45. Puerto Rico\n46. Serbia\n47. Switzerland\n48. Total\n\nSo, Ireland is at row index 34.\n\nNow, the claim says that Ireland scored only 1 silver medal and no other medals. So I need to check their gold, silver, and bronze medal counts.\n\nLooking at the table for Ireland: in the \"gold\" column, it's 0. In the \"silver\" column, it's 1. Bronze is also 0. That means Ireland has 1 silver medal only, and no gold or bronze medals.\n\nSo, according to the table, the claim seems to be TRUE because Ireland does have exactly 1 silver medal and no other medals.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the table to make sure I didn't misread anything. Let me verify the row for Ireland again:\n\n- Gold: 0\n- Silver: 1\n- Bronze: 0\n- Total: 1\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim accurately reflects the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as Ireland has exactly one silver medal and no other medals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 34,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 34,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 34,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
