    "claim": "the lowest championship score be a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a certain claim about a table is true or false. The table lists various years, champions, venues, locations, and scores. The claim says, \"the lowest championship score be a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It's saying that the lowest score in the championship is shared by two people: John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman, both scoring 205. So my job is to check if this is true based on the given data.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify all the scores and find the lowest one. Then, I have to see how many people scored that lowest number, especially focusing on whether John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman both achieved it.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's \"score\" column. The years range from 1977 up to 2013, so there are multiple entries. Let me list out all the scores:\n\n- 2013: 278\n- 2012: 271\n- 2011: 283\n- 2010: 277\n- 2009: 265\n- 2008: 279\n- 2007: 277\n- 2006: 274\n- 2005: 282\n- 2004: 278\n- 2003: 270\n- 2002: 271\n- 2001: 281\n- 2000: 282\n- 1999: 211\n- 1998: 280\n- 1997: 280 po (I assume \"po\" is a typo, maybe it's 280)\n- 1996: 276\n- 1995: 282\n- 1994: 283\n- 1993: 284\n- 1992: 283\n- 1991: 278\n- 1990: 205\n- 1989: 210\n- 1988: 205\n- 1987: 210 po (again, likely a typo)\n- 1986: 209\n- 1985: 211\n- 1984: 206\n- 1983: 214\n- 1982: 213 po (another typo)\n- 1981: 210\n- 1980: 205\n- 1979: 212\n- 1978: 209\n- 1977: 209\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest score here. The scores go as low as 205. Let me count how many times 205 appears.\n\nLooking through the list:\n- 1990: 205 (John Jackson)\n- 1988: 205 (Webb Heintzelman)\n\nAre there any others? No, I don't see another 205 besides these two entries. So both John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman scored 205, which is the lowest in the table.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that no one else scored lower than 205. The next lowest score after 205 is 206 (1984), then 209, 210, etc. So yes, 205 is indeed the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct: there's a tie between John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman at 205 for the lowest championship score.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1990, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1988, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest championship score be 284 by steve brady in 1993.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what needs to be checked. The claim mentions two things: the highest score and who achieved it. So I need to check both the highest score and whether Steve Brady was the one who scored that in 1993.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: year, champion, venue, location, and score. I should look for rows where the year is 1993 and see if the champion is Steve Brady. Then, check what his score was that year.\n\nStarting with the year 1993, I'll scan through the rows until I find the correct one. Let me go row by row:\n\n- 1994: Wes Short, Jr.\n- 1993: Steve Brady\n- So in 1993, Steve Brady is the champion. Now, what's his score?\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column for that year: it says 284.\n\nSo that matches both parts of the claim. The highest championship score (assuming 284 is the highest) by Steve Brady in 1993. But wait, I should check if there are any higher scores elsewhere to confirm it's the highest.\n\nLet me look at other years:\n\n- 2013: 278\n- 2012: 271\n- 2011: 283\n- 2010: 277\n- 2009: 265\n- 2008: 279\n- 2007: 277\n- 2006: 274\n- 2005: 282\n- 2004: 278\n- 2003: 270\n- 2002: 271\n- 2001: 281\n- 2000: 282\n- 1999: 211\n- 1998: 280\n- 1997: 280 po (I think this might be a typo, maybe 280)\n- 1996: 276\n- 1995: 282\n- 1994: 283\n- 1993: 284\n- Earlier years go down to 1977 with scores in the 200s or lower.\n\nLooking at these scores, 284 is indeed higher than all others listed. So it's the highest championship score in the table. Therefore, the claim seems correct on both points.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if any other entries might have a higher score. For example, in 2011, Frank Bensel scored 283, which is less than 284. In 2005 and 2000, it's 282. So yes, 284 is the highest.\n\nSo both conditions of the claim are met: Steve Brady achieved the highest score of 284 in 1993.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we checked for Steve Brady in 1993 and found his score to be 284, which is indeed the highest in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim to check: \"Bruce Zabriski score 282 at Pga National Golf Club, Haig & Champion Course.\" I need to figure out if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to see if Bruce Zabriski is listed. Scanning down the 'champion' column, I notice that his name appears in 1995. In that year, he was the champion with a score of 282 at \"pga national golf club , haig & champion courses.\" That matches exactly what's in the claim.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure there aren't any other entries for Bruce Zabriski. The next years don't have his name again, so that seems to be the only one. His location is listed as Florida, but the claim doesn't specify location, so it's okay.\n\nNext, I'll check the score. The claim says 282, and in 1995, Bruce Zabriski did score 282. So both the champion's name and the score match.\n\nI also need to make sure there aren't any other entries for that year or similar names that could confuse things. Looking at 1995, only Bruce is mentioned, so no duplicates or typos here.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of data about golf champions, their years, venues, locations, and scores. The claim is saying that there are four championship scores at La Quinta, California, from 1991 to 1994. My task is to check if this claim is true by looking at the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"championship score\" at La Quinta, California, specifically for the years 1991 through 1994. So I should look in the table for entries where the location is La Quinta and the year is between 1991 and 1994.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that the venue and location are split into two columns: \"venue\" and \"location.\" For example, one row says the venue is \"pga golf club , wanamaker course\" and the location is \"port st lucie , florida.\" Another row has the venue as \"thorny lea golf club\" and the location as \"brockton , massachusetts.\"\n\nI need to focus on rows where the location column is \"la quinta , california.\" Let me scan through each row:\n\nStarting from 1995 downwards, I see entries for La Quinta. For instance, in 1994, the champion is Wes Short Jr., with a venue of \"pga west , jack nicklaus private course\" and the location as \"la quinta , california,\" and the score is 283.\n\nLooking back, the years from 1991 to 1994 would be:\n\n- 1991: Kim Thompson, location La Quinta\n- 1992: Bill Loeffler, same location\n- 1993: Steve Brady, same location\n- 1994: Wes Short Jr., same location\n\nEach of these has a score associated with them. The claim says there are four championship scores at La Quinta in those years. So I need to check if each year from 1991 to 1994 has an entry where the location is La Quinta.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 1990: Not in our range, but it's Steve Gotsche at Thorny Lea.\n- 1991: Kim Thompson at La Quinta, score 278. That's one.\n- 1992: Bill Loeffler at La Quinta, 283. Second.\n- 1993: Steve Brady at La Quinta, 284. Third.\n- 1994: Wes Short Jr. at La Quinta, 283. Fourth.\n\nSo from 1991 to 1994, there are indeed four championship scores at La Quinta, California. Each year has a score listed.\n\nNow, I need to map this back to the table structure. The relevant columns for the claim would be \"year\" and \"score,\" but since the table doesn't have a separate column for \"year,\" the row index corresponds to the year in order. So each of these four rows is relevant because they match both the location and the years specified.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the four rows where the location is La Quinta and the year falls between 1991 and 1994.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there are four championship scores at La Quinta, California, for the years 1991-1994.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest championship score be a tie between robert thompson and mike west at 211.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at what the table shows. I need to check if there's any record of Robert Thompson or Mike West winning with a score of 211.\n\nLooking through each row in the table:\n\n- In 1990, Steve Gotsche won with a score of 205.\n- In 1989, Mike West had a score of 210.\n- In 1988, Webb Heintzelman scored 205.\n- In 1987, Darrell Kestner had a score of 210 po (I'm assuming that's 210 points?).\n- In 1986, Robert Thompson scored 209.\n- In 1985, John Fiedler scored 211.\n- In 1984, Fred Funk scored 206.\n- In 1983, Victor Tortorici had 214.\n- In 1982, Darrell Kestner had 213 po.\n- In 1981, Ted O'Rourke scored 210.\n- In 1980, John Jackson scored 205.\n- In 1979, Loren Roberts scored 212.\n- In 1978, Larry Griffin scored 209.\n- In 1977, Mike Zack scored 209.\n\nWait, I don't see any Robert Thompson or Mike West with a score of 211. The highest score in the table is 214 by Victor Tortorici in 1983. So maybe the claim is referring to an older year?\n\nWait, looking back at the table, I see that Robert Thompson scored 209 in 1986 and also 209 in 1990? Wait no, in 1990, it's Steve Gotsche.\n\nMike West scored 210 in 1989. But where did he get 211? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the table:\n\n- In 1995, Bruce Zabriski scored 282.\n- In 2000, Alan Schulte scored 282.\n- In 2004, Kirk Satterfield had 278.\n- Wait, but going back to earlier years, in 1985, John Fiedler scored 211.\n\nSo, I don't see Robert Thompson or Mike West with a score of 211. Robert Thompson's highest score is 209 in 1986 and again in 1990? No, 1990 was Steve Gotsche. So the claim seems to be incorrect because neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West achieved a score of 211 as per the table.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each row carefully:\n\n- 1977: Mike Zack -209\n- 1978: Larry Griffin -209\n- 1979: Loren Roberts -212\n- 1980: John Jackson -205\n- 1981: Ted O'Rourke -210\n- 1982: Darrell Kestner -213 po (assuming 213)\n- 1983: Victor Tortorici -214\n- 1984: Fred Funk -206\n- 1985: John Fiedler -211\n- 1986: Robert Thompson -209\n- 1987: Darrell Kestner -210 po\n- 1988: Webb Heintzelman -205\n- 1989: Mike West -210\n- 1990: Steve Gotsche -205\n\nSo, John Fiedler in 1985 scored 211. That's the highest score in the table. So neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West have a 211 score. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no tie between them at 211.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the highest championship score be a tie.\" So if the highest score is 214 by Victor Tortorici, then that's higher than both 211 and any others. So even if Robert and Mike had 211, it wouldn't be the highest. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West have a score of 211, and the actual highest is 214 by Victor Tortorici.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest championship score was a tie between Robert Thompson and Mike West at 211. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- The highest score recorded is 214 by Victor Tortorici in 1983.\n- Neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West achieved a score of 211.\n\nThus, the claim is false because neither individual reached 211, and there's no tie involved as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1985, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1986, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"all scores from 1996 - 2013 be at courses in port st lucie, florida.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. The claim is making a statement about all scores within that specific range (1996-2013) being associated with golf courses located in Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various years from 1996 up through 2013. Each row has details like champion, venue, location, and score. My task is to check for each relevant year whether their corresponding score is tied to a course in Port St. Lucie, FL.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows that fall within the years 1996-2013. Let me scan through the 'year' column:\n\n- 1996\n- 1997\n- 1998\n- 1999\n- 2000\n- 2001\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2004\n- 2005\n- 2006\n- 2007\n- 2008\n- 2009\n- 2010\n- 2011\n- 2012\n- 2013\n\nSo, that's from row 1996 (row index 21) up to 2013 (row index 35). Wait, actually, the table starts in 1977 and goes back. But the relevant years are from 1996 onwards.\n\nNext, for each of these rows, I need to check two things:\n\n1. The location is Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n2. The score exists (i.e., it's not something like \"not applicable\" or missing data).\n\nI'll go through each year one by one.\n\nStarting with 1996: \n- Champion: Jim Schuman\n- Venue: PGA Golf Club, Wanamaker Course\n- Location: Port St. Lucie, Florida\n- Score: 276\nSo, the location is correct, and there's a score. This row is relevant.\n\n1997:\n- Champion: Jim Schuman\n- Venue: PGA Golf Club, Ryder Course\n- Location: Port St. Lucie, Florida\n- Score: 280 po (I assume that's a typo for \"points\" or \"PO\", but since it's present, we can consider it as data.)\nSo, location is correct.\n\n1998:\n- Champion: Rick Gehr\n- Venue: PGA Golf Club, Ryder Course\n- Location: Port St. Lucie, Florida\n- Score: 280\nCorrect again.\n\n1999:\n- Champion: ?\n- Venue: PGA Golf Club, Wanamaker Course\n- Location: Port St. Lucie, Florida\nWait, the champion for 1999 isn't listed in the table provided. Hmm, that might be a problem because I can't see the full data here. But assuming that the venue is still Port St. Lucie, FL, then it's relevant.\n\n2000:\n- Champion: ?\n- Venue: PGA Golf Club, Wanamaker Course\n- Location: Port St. Lucie, Florida\nSame as above; not sure about champion but location is correct.\n\nContinuing this way would be tedious, but I can see a pattern that from 1996 onwards, the venues are either PGA Golf Club with either Ryder or Wanamaker courses, and all of them are in Port St. Lucie, FL. So the scores for these years should all be associated with courses in that location.\n\nHowever, wait a minute: looking back at 2013, which is part of the range. The last row provided is 1977, so maybe I misread the table structure. Wait, no, the table starts from 1977 and goes up to 2013, but each year's data is on separate rows.\n\nBut in any case, from 1996 to 2013, all the relevant rows have locations that are either Port St. Lucie, FL or sometimes just listed as \"Port St. Lucie\".\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back at the table, I see that some venues might be different. For example, starting from 1980 onwards, there's a shift in venues to Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brookton, Massachusetts. So for years after 1979, many have \"Thorny Lea Golf Club\" as their venue.\n\nWait, let me check the table again:\n\nLooking at the years 1996-2013:\n\nFor example, 2000:\n- Venue: PGA Golf Club, Wanamaker Course\nBut others like 1982 onwards list Thorny Lea Golf Club.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the table provided, after 1979, the venues change to Thorny Lea Golf Club starting around 1980. So for years 1996 and above, most of them are either at PGA Golf Club or Thorny Lea Golf Club.\n\nWait, but if the claim is about all scores from 1996-2013 being at courses in Port St. Lucie, FL, then I need to check whether each of these years' scores are associated with a course located there.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- 1996: Port St. Lucie, FL (PGA Golf Club)\n- 1997: same\n- ...\n- But 2013 is in the table as well; checking its venue.\n\nWait, but looking at the table provided by the user, it goes up to 1977. Wait no\u2014the table provided starts from 1977 and ends with 1977? That can't be right because the claim is about 1996-2013, which should be in later rows. Perhaps I misread the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is not complete. Let me check again:\n\nThe user's table lists years starting at 1977 and goes up to 1977? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, the table provided by the user starts with year 1977 and ends with 2013. So rows go from 1977 (row index 0) up to 2013 (probably row index 37). But in any case, for the years 1996-2013, we need to check each of those.\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\nFrom 1980 onwards, many entries are for Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brookton, MA. So, for example, 1980 and beyond have that venue.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about scores being associated with Port St. Lucie, FL courses. So if a score falls under a course not in Port St. Lucie, then the claim is false.\n\nSo I need to check each year from 1996-2013 whether their respective score's venue is in Port St. Lucie, FL.\n\nLooking at rows for these years:\n\nFor example, 1996: Port St. Lucie, FL (PGA Golf Club)\n1997: same\n...\nBut wait, after a certain point, the venues change to Thorny Lea Golf Club.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back at the table, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me actually parse the data correctly:\n\nI think I made a mistake in assuming that all rows after 1979 have Thorny Lea Golf Club. Wait, looking again, it's possible that the venues for Port St. Lucie and Brookton are separate.\n\nWait, no\u2014the table shows that from 1980 onwards, many of the entries are for Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brookton, MA. So, for example, 1982: Venue is Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brookton, MA.\n\nThus, scores from these years (1982 and later) would be associated with a course not in Port St. Lucie, FL.\n\nTherefore, the claim that all scores from 1996-2013 are at courses in Port St. Lucie, FL is incorrect because after 1979 or so, many are at Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brookton, MA.\n\nBut wait, the user's table shows both types of venues: some for Port St. Lucie, FL and others for Brookton, MA.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- 1996: Port St. Lucie, FL (PGA Golf Club)\n- 1997: same\n...\n- 2005: same\nBut then after that, perhaps it changes? Or not?\n\nWait, I think the table provided by the user may have multiple entries from each year, but without knowing exactly, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on the fact that some of these years are in Port St. Lucie, FL and others are not, so the claim is false because not all scores are at Port St. Lucie, FL courses.\n\nTherefore, to answer the task: You are tasked with determining whether \"all scores from 1996-2013\" are associated with courses located in Port St. Lucie, FL. But upon examining the table, we can see that after a certain year (maybe around 1980), many entries are for Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brookton, MA, which is not Port St. Lucie, FL.\n\nThus, since some scores in this period are associated with courses outside of Port St. Lucie, FL, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that all scores from 1996 to 2013 are associated with courses located in Port St. Lucie, Florida is false. During this period, many events took place at the Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brookton, Massachusetts, which is not in Port St. Lucie, FL. Therefore, not all the scores are tied to courses in that specific location.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because some scores during 1996-2013 were associated with courses outside of Port St. Lucie, FL.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984.\"\n\nFirst, I'll analyze each part of the claim step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim mentions two specific things:\n   - The lowest championship score.\n   - This score was achieved by Fred Funk in 1984.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Columns**: From the table, the relevant columns are \"champion\", \"score\", \"year\", and possibly \"location\" if needed to verify details about Fred Funk's performance in 1984.\n\n3. **Locating Fred Funk in the Table**:\n   - I'll scan each row for the name \"Fred Funk.\"\n   - Upon checking, I notice that the table goes from 2013 down to 1977.\n   - Looking through each year, I don't find \"Fred Funk\" listed anywhere in the \"champion\" column. For example, in 1984, the champion is \"victor tortorici,\" not Fred Funk.\n\n4. **Checking for a Score of 206**:\n   - The claim mentions a score of 206. I need to check if this score exists and who achieved it.\n   - Scanning through all the scores in the table, I see that some scores are lower than others.\n   - Notably, in the years around 1984, such as 1983 (214), 1984 (206), but 1984's champion is Victor Tortorici with a score of 206. Wait, no: looking back, in 1984, Fred Funk is not listed; instead, Victor Tortorici is the champion with a score of 206.\n   - So, the score of 206 does exist but was achieved by someone else (Victor Tortorici) in 1984.\n\n5. **Assessing the Claim**:\n   - The claim says Fred Funk achieved this score in 1984, but according to the table, Fred Funk is not present in that year.\n   - Therefore, the claim incorrectly attributes the 206 score to Fred Funk when it was actually Victor Tortorici who scored 206 in 1984.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The lowest championship score of 206 was indeed achieved in 1984, but by someone else, not Fred Funk. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1983, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1983, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1984, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1984, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"bruce zabriski score 284 at thorny lea golf club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look through the table to understand what information it holds. The table has several columns: year, champion, venue, location, and score. Each row represents a different year with various details about a tournament or event.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"Bruce Zabriski\" scoring 284 at \"Thorny Lea Golf Club.\" I need to check if this specific combination of information exists in the table.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"bruce zabriski\" in the \"champion\" column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- 2013: frank bensel\n- 2012: jake scott\n- 2011: frank bensel\n- 2010: frank bensel\n- 2009: tim thelen\n- 2008: kyle voska\n- 2007: chris moody\n- 2006: brad lardon\n- 2005: kyle flinton\n- 2004: kirk satterfield\n- 2003: kyle flinton\n- 2002: kyle flinton\n- 2001: frank dobbs\n- 2000: alan schulte\n- 1999: randall mccracken\n- 1998: rick gehr\n- 1997: jim schuman\n- 1996: jim schuman\n- 1995: bruce zabriski\n\nAh, here it is. In the year 1995, Bruce Zabriski is listed as the champion.\n\nNext, I check the score column for that row. The score is 282. Hmm, but the claim says he scored 284 at Thorny Lea Golf Club. Wait, let me also check the venue and location columns to ensure everything matches.\n\nLooking at the \"venue\" column for 1995: it's \"pga national golf club , haig & champion courses.\" The location is listed as \"palm beach gardens , florida.\"\n\nNow, checking if Bruce Zabriski played at Thorny Lea Golf Club. Scanning through the table again:\n\nI notice that from 1980 onwards, the venue changes to \"thorny lea golf club\" and the location becomes \"brockton , massachusetts.\" However, all entries for Thorny Lea Golf Club are in Brockton, Massachusetts, not Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.\n\nSo, Bruce Zabriski's event in 1995 was at the PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens. There's no entry where he played at Thorny Lea Golf Club with a score of 284.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there's another row for Bruce Zabriski. From the table, it seems he only appears once in 1995. So, that's the only one.\n\nAlso, checking the scores again: 1995 is 282, not 284. I don't see a 284 score linked to him either. Additionally, all Thorny Lea Golf Club entries are for different champions with scores like 205, 210, etc., but none mention Bruce Zabriski.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- Bruce Zabriski did play in the tournament in 1995, scoring 282 at the PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens.\n- There's no record of him playing at Thorny Lea Golf Club with a score of 284.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1995, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1995, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"there be 3 championship score at bockton , massachusetts in 1991 - 1994.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being claimed here. It mentions \"championship scores\" specifically at \"Brockton, Massachusetts\" between the years 1991 and 1994. So, I should look for any entries in the table that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: year, champion, venue, location, and score. The location column is where the place is mentioned, so I'll focus on that. The years we're interested in are 1991 through 1994 inclusive.\n\nI need to scan each row from 1991 to 1994 and check if the location is \"Brockton, Massachusetts.\" Let's go year by year:\n\n- **1991**: Checking the table, I see entries for 1990, 1989, etc., going down. Wait, no\u2014looking at the top, it starts from 2013 going down to 1977. So the rows are in descending order. Therefore, I need to check where year is 1991 and beyond.\n\nLooking for rows with years 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994.\n\nFor each of these years, I'll look at the location column:\n\n- **1991**: The row says \"la quinta , california\" under location. So that's not Brockton, MA.\n- **1992**: Same location as above.\nWait, no, actually looking more carefully: From 1990 onwards, the locations change.\n\nWait, in the table, after 1989, it starts mentioning \"thorny lea golf club\" with locations like \"brockton , massachusetts.\" So I need to find rows from 1991 to 1994 where location is Brockton, MA.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **1990**: Location is Brockton, MA. But that's for 1990.\n- **1989**: Same location but earlier year.\n- Then it goes into the 80s, etc., with same location until 1977.\n\nWait, actually, the table provided doesn't seem to have any entries from 1991 to 1994 in the rows listed. The latest years before 1990 are 1989 and 1990. So perhaps there are no championship scores for Brockton, MA in those years.\n\nLooking specifically at 1991-1994:\n\nI need to check each row where year is between 1991 and 1994 (inclusive) and location is \"Brockton, Massachusetts.\" \n\nLooking through the table, I see that rows from 1980 onwards list \"thorny lea golf club\" as venue with location \"brockton , massachusetts.\" So starting from 1977 up to maybe 1990.\n\nBut for years 1991-1994, let's check each:\n\n- **1991**: The row is year 1991? Wait, looking at the table again, it starts from 2013 down. So in the table, rows are listed as follows: 2013, 2012,...,1980,1977. So to find 1991, I need to look for that specific row.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the structure of the table provided. The table's header is year, champion, venue, location, score. Then each row corresponds to a specific year.\n\nSo, for example, the first data row is for 2013, then 2012, etc., going down to 1977.\n\nTherefore, I need to find rows where year is in 1991-1994 and location is \"Brockton, Massachusetts.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nFrom 1980 onwards, let's see:\n\n- 1980: location is Brockton, MA\n- 1981: same\n...\n- 1990: same\nThen 1991? Is there a row for 1991 with location Brockton?\n\nWait, in the provided table, after 1977, it goes to 1978, etc. So perhaps there's no data for 1991-1994 because the table only goes down to 1977.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any of the years from 1991 to 1994 have location Brockton, MA.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow for year 1979: venue is Thorny Lea Golf Club, location Brockton, MA\n\nSimilarly, rows from 1980 onwards up to 1990 have that same location.\n\nBut there's no entry in the table for years 1991-1994. Therefore, I don't see any data points matching those criteria.\n\nSo, does the claim say \"there be\" meaning at least three scores? If there are none, then it would be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"3 championship score at Brockton, MA in 1991-1994.\" So three different years within that period with a score.\n\nBut looking at the table, from 1980 to 1990, there are multiple entries for Brockton, MA, but not for 1991-1994. Therefore, the number of such championship scores is zero, which is less than three.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three championship scores in Brockton, Massachusetts between 1991 and 1994. By examining the table, no entries match these criteria as the relevant years don't have any data points for that location during that timeframe. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
