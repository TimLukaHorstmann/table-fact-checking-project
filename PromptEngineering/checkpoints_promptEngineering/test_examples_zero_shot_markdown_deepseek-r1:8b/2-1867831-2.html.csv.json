    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim states: \"the type code of sl 500 , sl 550 be cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m273 )\".\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: model, years, type/code, power rpm, torque rpm. The row indices are from 0 to 4.\n\nLooking for models \"sl 500\" and \"sl 550\". Let's check each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Model is sl 350, type/codes mention cubic centimetres v6 (m272), so not relevant.\n- **Row 2**: Models are sl 500 and sl 550. Type/code here is cubic centimetres v8 (m273). This matches the claim for both models in question.\n- **Row 3**: Model is sl 55 amg, type/codes mention v8 supercharged (m113), so not relevant to sl 500 or sl 550.\n- **Rows 4 and beyond**: Not provided, but since the table stops at row 4, I don't need to consider further.\n\nThe claim specifies that both sl 500 and sl 550 have type/code as cubic centimetre v8 (m273). From row 2, this is true for both models. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type / code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"2006 - 2008 have a type / code of cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m272 )\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see what each row contains. The table has several columns: model, years, type/code, power rpm, and torque rpm. Each row represents different models with their respective details.\n\nLooking at the claim, it's focusing on two things: the years (2006 - 2008) and the type/code being cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 with m272. So I need to find any model in the table that falls within these years and has this specific type/code.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **SL 350**: Years are 2006 - 2008. Type/code is cubic centimetres (cuin) v6 (m272). Hmm, the claim mentions v8, so this doesn't match.\n2. **SL 500, SL 550**: Both models have years 2006 - 2008 and type/code as cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 (m273). Wait, the type here is m273, not m272. So that's a discrepancy.\n3. **SL 55 AMG**: Years are 2006 - 2008 but it's a supercharged v8. The code here is m113. Not m272, so doesn't match.\n4. **SL 600**: This one uses a v12 biturbo with code m275 amg. Doesn't fit the claim at all.\n5. **SL 65 AMG**: Years are from 2004 onwards but this model has a different type/code as well.\n\nWait, none of the models in 2006 - 2008 have the exact combination of cubic centimetre v8 with m272. The SL 500 and SL 550 do have v8 but with m273 instead of m272. So that means there's no row where the years are 2006-2008 and the type/code is exactly as stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it doesn't match any model in the table during those years. The correct code for those models is different.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"type / code\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"model\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
