    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a football match is TRUE or FALSE based on a table provided. The table lists several matches with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"On 14 february 1976, the away team was manchester united and they scored 1 - 2 against the home team leicester city.\" \n\nSo, I need to check if there's a match in the table that matches all these criteria on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with various details. The columns are tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. Let's go through each relevant part of the claim one by one.\n\n1. **Date Check**: The claim mentions February 14, 1976. Scanning the 'date' column in the table, I see that several matches took place on this date:\n   - Tie numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 all have \"14 february 1976\" as their date.\n\n2. **Away Team**: The claim specifies that the away team was Manchester United. I'll check each of the matches on February 14th to see if any had Manchester United as the away team.\n\n   - Tie 1: Home team Leicester City vs Away Man U \u2013 this matches.\n   - Tie 2: Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle United \u2013 no, not Man U.\n   - Tie 3: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Charlton Athletic \u2013 no.\n   - Tie 4: West Bromwich Albion vs Southampton \u2013 no.\n   - Tie 5: Derby County vs Southend United \u2013 no.\n   - Tie 7: Chelsea vs Crystal Palace \u2013 no.\n   - Tie 8: Stoke City vs Sunderland \u2013 no.\n\n   So, only Tie 1 on February 14th has Manchester United as the away team.\n\n3. **Score Check**: The claim says the score was 1 - 2 in favor of Leicester City (since it's the home team). Looking at Tie 1:\n   - Score is listed as \"1 - 2\". \n   - Since it's a home game, the score would be for the home team. So, 1 - 2 implies Leicester scored 1 and Man U scored 2? Wait, no\u2014wait, in football, the score is typically written as Home - Away. So if the away team (Man U) scored 2 and the home team scored 1, the score would be 1 - 2, but that's not standard because usually the higher number is for the away team if they win.\n\n   Wait, actually, in football scores, it's goal tally first for home then away. So a score of 1 - 2 would mean the home scored 1 and the away scored 2. But the claim says \"score 1 - 2 with home team leicester city.\" That suggests that Leicester scored 1 and Man U scored 2, meaning they lost.\n\n   Looking at Tie 1: Home team Leicester City scored 1, away Man U scored 2. So the score is indeed 1 - 2, which matches the claim.\n\nPutting it all together, the match on February 14th between Leicester City (home) and Manchester United (away) had a score of 1-2. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Tie 1 of the table, where the date, away team, and score all match the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe table lists several matches with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. The claim states two specific conditions:\n\n1. \"the score be 2 - 1 when the away team be stoke city and home team be sunderland\"\n2. \"the score be 0 - 0 when the away team be sunderland and home team be stoke city\"\n\nI need to check each condition against the table to see if these scores and team configurations exist.\n\nStarting with the first condition: a match where the home team is Sunderland and the away team is Stoke City with a score of 2-1. Looking through the table, I'll scan each row for matches involving these teams.\n\nIn row 8, home team is Stoke City vs. away team Sunderland. The score there is 0-0. That's not the 2-1 we're looking for. Next, in the replay section (row 9), the same pair of teams have a score of 2-1, with Sunderland as away and Stoke City as home. Wait, no: row 9 shows Sunderland away to Stoke City with a score of 2-1. But that's actually the reverse of the first condition. The claim specifies that when Sunderland is the home team and Stoke City is the away team, but in the table, row 8 has Stoke City as home and Sunderland as away with a 0-0 score, while row 9 is the replay where Sunderlan is away to Stoke City with 2-1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The first condition says home team is Sunderland, away team is Stoke City, score 2-1. In the table, looking for a match where home is Sunderland and away is Stoke City. Checking each row:\n\nRow 8: Home is Stoke City vs. Sunderlan as away. So that's not it.\n\nLooking further down, I see that in row 9, the replay shows Sunderlan (away) vs. Stoke City (home), score 2-1. But that doesn't match the first condition because the home team isn't Sunderland but Stoke City. So for the first part of the claim, is there a match where Sunderland is home and Stoke City is away with 2-1? I don't see that in the table. The only match between these two teams is row 8 (0-0) and row 9 (2-1), but in both cases, the home team alternates between Stoke and Sunderlan.\n\nWait, actually, row 8: Stoke City is home vs. Sunderland away with score 0-0. Then row 9: Sunderlan away to Stoke City, so the home team is Stoke again? No, wait, no\u2014Stoke can't be both home and away in different rows. So in row 8, Stoke is home, Sunderlan is away. In row 9, Sunderlan is away, but who is the home? The table shows \"stoke city\" as the team, so I think it's a typo or mislabeling because Stoke can't be both home and away in different matches.\n\nWait no, perhaps the table has a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at row 8: home team stoke city vs. sunderland (away), score 0-0.\n\nThen row 9 is labeled as replay, same tie number? No, the tie numbers are 1 to 7 and then replay for some. Wait, looking back, the table starts with tie no, then after a few entries, it shows 'replay' for tie no. So maybe tie 8 is actually two matches: first, Stoke City vs Sunderlan 0-0 on 14 Feb, then a replay where Sunderlan vs Stoke City with 2-1 on 17 Feb.\n\nWait, but the table's structure might be that each row represents one match, so tie no 8 is one match. But looking at the table, it's structured as:\n\n| tie no   | home team               | score   | away team            | date             |\n|:---------|:------------------------|:--------|:---------------------|:-----------------|\n| 1        | leicester city          | 1 - 2   | manchester united    | 14 february 1976 |\n... more rows ...\n8        | stoke city              | 0 - 0   | sunderland           | 14 february 1976 |\n9        | sunderland              | 2 - 1   | stoke city           | 17 february 1976 |\n\nWait, that's confusing. So tie no 8 is the initial match with Stoke City home vs Sunderlan away, score 0-0 on 14 Feb. Then tie no 9 is a replay where Sunderlan is home and Stoke City away, score 2-1 on 17 Feb.\n\nSo in the table, there are two entries for these teams: one as home (Stoke) and one as away (Sunderland). So for the first condition of the claim: home team Sunderland vs away team Stoke with 2-1. In the table, that would be if there's a row where home is Sunderlan and away is Stoke City, but I don't see such a match. The only matches involving these two are:\n\n- Stoke City home vs Sunderlan away (0-0) on 14 Feb.\n- Sunderlan home vs Stoke City away (2-1) on 17 Feb.\n\nSo the claim's first part requires that when Sunderland is home and Stoke is away, the score was 2-1. But in reality, when Sunderlan was home, it was 2-1 against Stoke. So the first condition isn't met because the score 2-1 occurs when Sunderlan is home, not when Sunderlan is away.\n\nNow, moving to the second condition: score 0-0 when away team is Sunderlan and home team is Stoke City. Looking through the table, in tie no 8, we have Stoke as home vs Sunderlan as away with a 0-0 score. That matches exactly. So the second condition is true.\n\nBut since one part of the claim isn't met (first condition), does that make the entire claim false? Or do I need both conditions to be true?\n\nWait, the claim says \"the score be 2 - 1 when... and the score be 0 - 0...\" So it's stating two separate instances. If both are required, then if either isn't present, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The claim could be interpreted as stating that in one event, both conditions happened: there was a match where Sunderlan was home and Stoke away with 2-1, AND another match where Stoke was home and Sunderlan away with 0-0. But looking at the table, those two matches are indeed present on different dates.\n\nWait no, because the claim says \"the score be 2 - 1 when... and the score be 0 - 0\". It could be implying that in one match, both scores occurred, which isn't possible. Alternatively, it might mean that there exists a match where 2-1 happened (with Sunderlan as home) AND another match where 0-0 happened (with Stoke as home). If the claim is stating that both situations have occurred, then yes, both are present.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Let me check: \"You are tasked to... for each test case, determine if the statement is true.\"\n\nThe statement says: \"For all matches between stoke city and sunderland, it holds that whenever one team scored 2-1 against the other, then in the same match, the other team had scored 0-0.\" Or perhaps not. Wait, no\u2014the claim isn't about the same match.\n\nWait, perhaps the original task is to check if in some matches between Stoke and Sunderlan, they had certain scores, regardless of the same match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is testing for logical conditions.\n\nBut given that the table shows two matches:\n\n1. Stoke (home) vs Sunderlan (away): 0-0.\n2. Sunderlan (home) vs Stoke (away): 2-1.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are true: there's a match where they scored 0-0, and another where one scored 2-1.\n\nWait no, wait. The second condition is \"the score be 0 - 0 when away team is sunderland and home team is stoke city.\" Which matches exactly the first match in tie no 8. So that's true.\n\nThe first condition is \"the score be 2 - 1 when home team is sunderland and away team is stoke city.\" But looking at the table, that would require a match where Sunderlan is home vs Stoke as away with 2-1. However, in the table, the only match where Sunderlan scored 2-1 is when they were at home against Stoke. So if the claim requires that whenever Sunderlan was home, it was 2-1, but the first condition doesn't specify whether it's a home or away for Sunderlan.\n\nWait no, the first part of the claim says \"when home team is sunderland and away team is stoke city.\" So in the table, we don't have any match where Sunderlan was home vs Stoke with 2-1. Wait, actually, in tie no 8: Stoke (home) vs Sunderlan (away), 0-0.\n\nThen tie no 9: Sunderlan (home) vs Stoke (away), 2-1.\n\nSo the first condition would require that whenever Sunderlan was home and Stoke away, the score was 2-1. But in reality, when Sunderlan was home, the score was 2-1; but when they were away, it was 0-0.\n\nWait no, because in the claim, the first part is a conditional: if (home team is sunderland and away team is stoke) then (score is 2 -1). So does any such match exist? In tie no 8: home is Stoke, not Sunderlan. Tie no 9: home is Sunderlan, so it's the other way around.\n\nSo for the first condition: are there matches where home team is Sunderlan and away team is Stoke with score 2-1? Yes, tie no 9.\n\nWait, but in tie no 8: home is Stoke, so that doesn't satisfy the home team being Sunderlan. Tie no 9 satisfies it because home is Sunderlan, away is Stoke, score is 2-1.\n\nSo both conditions are met: whenever (home is Sunderlan and away is Stoke), which happens once in tie no 9, then the score was 2-1; and also, when home is Stoke and away is Sunderlan (tie no 8), the score was 0-0. So both parts of the claim hold true.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the first condition would require any such match to have a 2-1 score, which it did in tie no 9; the second condition requires that when home is Stoke and away is Sunderlan, the score was 0-0, which also happened. So both conditions are true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting, but given the table, yes, both parts of the claim are satisfied.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true because there exists a match where stoke city was at home and sunderland was away with a score of 0-0, and another match where sunderland was at home and stoke was away with a score of 2-1.\n\nAnswer: True.",

Chelsea is the home team against Crystal Palace as the away team.\n2. Norwich City is the home team against Bradford City as the away team.\n\nI'll need to look through each row of the table to find matches for these conditions.\n\nStarting with the first part: Looking for Chelsea as the home team and Crystal Palace as the away team. I'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Leicester vs Manchester Utd. No match.\n- Row 2: Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle Utd. No match.\n- Row 3: Wolves vs Charlton. No.\n- Row 4: West Brom vs Southampton. No.\n- Row 5: Derby vs Southend. No.\n- Row 6: Norwich vs Bradford.

Away team is southend united with a score of 1 - 0.\n2. Home team is chelsea with a score of 2 - 3.\n\nI'll need to scan each row for these conditions.\n\nStarting with the first condition: away team is southend united and score is 1 - 0.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Row 1: away team is manchester united, not southend.\n- Row 2: away team is newcastle united.\n- Row 3: replay, same as row 2.\n- Row 4: same as row 3.\n- Row 5: away team is southend united. Let's check the score here: 1 - 0. Yes, this matches the first condition.\n\nSo, row 5 has the away team as southend united and a score of 1 - 0.

This matches exactly.\n\nSo, row 7 satisfies the second part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met in different rows (row 5 and row 7). \n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure that these two rows are actually related or if they can be considered together. The claim is stating that both events occur: southend united as away with 1-0 and chelsea at home with 2-3. Since the table has separate matches for each, it's correct to say that on different dates, these conditions occurred.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because there are entries in the table where the away team is southend united with a score of 1 - 0 (row 5) and another entry where the home team is chelsea with a score of 2 - 3 (row 7).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are rows 5 and 7 for their respective conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read through the claim again carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"all game take place 14 february 1976 or after or 23 february 1976 or before and there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. I'll break it down into parts to understand what it's saying.\n\nFirst part: \"all game take place on or after 14 February 1976 or on or before 23 February 1976.\" So, all matches should have been played either starting from the 14th up to and including the 23rd of February 1976. That seems straightforward. If a match was scheduled earlier than the 14th or later than the 23rd, that would violate this condition.\n\nSecond part: \"there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1.\" So, in all matches, the tie score (I assume) should not go above 8 or drop below 1. Wait, actually, looking at the table, I see columns for home team and away team with scores like \"3 - 3\", which would be a draw. So maybe the term \"tie\" here refers to draws, where the score is equal on both sides.\n\nBut in the context of football (soccer), typically a tie or draw is when both teams have the same score. So if a game ends with a score like 1-1, that's a tie. But I also need to check what exactly is being measured here. The claim mentions \"tie higher than 8 or below 1.\" That doesn't make much sense because in football, ties are determined by whether the scores are equal. So perhaps the term \"tie\" in this context refers to draws where the score is tied at a certain point, but the overall result might not necessarily be a draw.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the table, I see entries like \"0 - 0\", which is a draw, and \"1 - 2\" which means one team won. So maybe the claim is referring to the half-time score or some other tie in terms of goals, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of ties in the games\u2014how many draws there are.\n\nBut then the claim says \"there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1.\" That phrasing is confusing. It might mean that all matches have a score where the home team didn't lose by more than 8 goals and didn't win by less than 1 goal. Alternatively, it could refer to the number of ties (draws) not exceeding 8 or being zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the table again.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. For example:\n\n- Row 1: Leicester City vs Manchester United, score 1 - 2 (Manchester won), date 14 Feb 1976.\n- Row 2: Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle United, score 3 - 3, date same day.\n- Then there are replays on the 18th and 23rd.\n\nSo, for each game, I need to check whether all games took place between 14 Feb and 23 Feb, inclusive. And also check that in all matches, the tie (draw) didn't happen higher than 8 or below 1? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"tie\" refers to the number of draws. So the claim is saying that there are never more than 8 draws and at least one draw. But I'm not sure because the wording is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the score in each game: for any game, the tie (if there was a draw) didn't result in a score higher than 8 or lower than 1.\n\nBut in football, scores don't go that high. The maximum goals in a match are unlikely to be as high as 8. So maybe the claim is trying to say that all games took place within those dates and that no game ended with a draw where the score was higher than 8 or lower than 1.\n\nBut this seems odd because, in reality, football matches don't have such high scores\u2014unless it's a friendly or something else. Also, considering the context of the table, which includes both initial matches and replays on the 18th and 23rd, I think the main point is to check two things: \n\n1. All games took place between 14 Feb 1976 and 23 Feb 1976 (inclusive).\n2. In all games, if there was a tie (draw), it wasn't higher than 8 goals or lower than 1 goal.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\n- For example, row 3: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Charlton Athletic, score 3 - 0. That's a win for Wolves.\n- Row 4: West Bromwich Albion vs Southampton, 1 - 1, which is a draw.\n- Then in replays, Southampton beats West Brom 4-0.\n\nSo looking at the initial matches on 14 Feb:\n\n- Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle United ended 3-3, so that's a draw.\n- There's another entry for replay on 18 Feb and then 23 Feb, leading to Newcastle winning.\n\nWait, but in the table, the first two entries are for 14 Feb. Then replays on 18 and 23. So I think each tie no refers to different games. So tie no 1 is Leicester vs Man Utd, tie no 2 is Bolton vs Newcastle. Then there's a replay for each of those.\n\nSo the dates are:\n\n- 14 Feb: multiple matches\n- Replays on 18 and 23 Feb.\n\nTherefore, all initial matches were on 14 Feb, with replays up to 23 Feb.\n\nNow, checking whether all games took place between 14 Feb or after and before 23 Feb. So no game was played before the 14th or after the 23rd? Looking at the table, all dates are either 14, 18, or 23 Feb, so yes, they fall within that period.\n\nNext part: \"there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1.\" So in each game, if it was a draw, the score can't be higher than 8 or lower than 1. But since all scores are between 0 and maybe up to 3, 4 goals, this condition is automatically satisfied because no game has a score higher than 8 or below 1.\n\nWait, but in the table, there's a game on 23 Feb with score 1 - 2 (so home team scored 1). So that's within 1 to 8. So no game exceeds 8 goals or is lower than 0? But all scores are at least 0 for each half, I think.\n\nBut maybe the claim is about the number of ties\u2014like the number of draws in total\u2014never exceeding 8 and being at least 1. But that seems off because looking at the table:\n\n- Tie no 2: Bolton vs Newcastle ended 3-3 (a draw).\n- Then on replays, another match ended as a win for Newcastle, so maybe only one draw.\n\nSo if the claim is saying that there was never more than one tie (draw) in any game, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"tie\" refers to something else. Maybe the number of tied positions in standings? That doesn't seem right either.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me parse the claim again:\n\n\"You are tasked with verifying that all games took place between 14 Feb and 23 Feb (inclusive) AND that in each game, if there was a tie (draw), then it wasn't higher than 8 or lower than 1.\"\n\nSo for the first part: All dates in the table are either 14, 18, or 23 Feb. So yes, all games took place within that timeframe.\n\nFor the second part: In each game, if it was a draw, the score isn't higher than 8 or lower than 1. But since all scores are between 0 and maybe up to 4 goals (in reality), this condition is automatically satisfied because no game has a score above 8 or below 0.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are true based on the table provided. So I think that's what needs to be verified.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the task:\n\n1. **All games took place between 14 Feb and 23 Feb (inclusive):**\n   - All dates in the table fall within this timeframe: 14 Feb, 18 Feb, and 23 Feb.\n\n2. **No tie (draw) had a score higher than 8 or lower than 1:**\n   - In football matches, scores typically do not exceed 8 goals or drop below 0. The provided table shows scores like 3-3, 1-1, etc., which are within the specified range.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both conditions are satisfied based on the data provided.",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. The claim states two specific score outcomes:\n\n1. When the home team is Stoke City and the away team is Sunderland, the score was 4 - 0.\n2. When the home team is Sunderland and the away team is Stoke City, the score was 2 - 3.\n\nI need to check if these scores exist in the table as per the given conditions.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details: tie no (which seems like a sequential numbering), home team, score, away team, and date. The \"tie no\" includes both regular matches and replays.\n\nI'll start by looking for any entries where the home team is Stoke City and the away team is Sunderland.\n\nScanning through each row:\n\n- Row 8: Home team is Stoke City, away team is Sunderland. The score here is 0 - 0 on February 14, 1976. That doesn't match the claimed 4 - 0.\n- Then there's a replay in row 9: Sunderland vs. Stoke City with a score of 2 - 1 on February 17, 1976. This also doesn't match either of the scores mentioned.\n\nWait, the claim mentions two separate scenarios. The first is Stoke City at home against Sunderland (4-0), and the second is Sunderland at home against Stoke City (2-3). I need to check if both these pairs exist with those exact scores in the table.\n\nLooking for Stoke City as home vs. Sunderland:\n\nOnly row 8 and its replay fit this, but the scores are 0-0 and 2-1 respectively. No 4-0 or 2-3 here.\n\nNow checking for Sunderland as home vs. Stoke City:\n\nLooking through all rows, I don't see any entry where the home team is Sunderland against Stoke City with a score of 2 - 3 or 4 - 0. The closest is row 8 and its replay, but those are from when Stoke was home.\n\nSo, neither of the scores mentioned in the claim appear in the table under the specified conditions. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any entries that match either condition stated in the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"On 18 February 1976, the away team was Leicester City and they scored 3-0 against Manchester United.\" So I'm looking for a match on that specific date where Leicester City is the away team and their score is 3-0.\n\nLooking at the table, it's in markdown format with columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. Each row has a unique index, probably starting from 1 upwards, but sometimes there are \"replay\" entries which might indicate a second match on that day between the same teams.\n\nI need to go through each row to find if there's a match that fits all three criteria: date is 18 February 1976, away team is Leicester City, and score is 3-0.\n\nLet me look at the table data:\n\n1. tie no | home team               | score   | away team            | date\n2.        | leicester city          | 1 - 2   | manchester united    |14 feb...\nWait, no, that's row 1. The first row (index 0) is tie no 1, Leicester City as home, scored 1-2 against Manchester United on 14 February.\n\nRow 2: tie no 2, Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle United, score 3-3 on 14 Feb.\n\nThen there are replays starting from tie no 3? Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the table seems to have a mix of \"tie no\" and \"replay\". For example, row 3 is labeled \"replay\", with Newcastle United as away team, but wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: tie no 1, Leicester City (home) vs Man U (away), score 1-2 on 14 Feb.\n\nRow 2: tie no 2, Bolton Wanderers (home) vs Newcastle U (away), 3-3 on 14 Feb.\n\nThen row 3 is labeled \"replay\" with Newcastle U (home?) vs Bolton W? Score 0-0 on 18 Feb. Wait, the date here is 18 February, which matches part of the claim. The away team in this replay is Bolton Wanderers, and they scored 0-0.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match the claim where Leicester City is the away team. So row 3: home team is Newcastle United, away is Bolton W, score 0-0 on 18 Feb.\n\nRow 4: tie no 3? Or another replay? It says \"replay\", so maybe a second replay between the same teams. Here, Bolton W (home) vs Newcastle U (away), score 1-2 on 23 Feb.\n\nSo for dates on 14 Feb and then replays on 18 and 23 Feb.\n\nThe claim is about 18 Feb. So I need to check if any row has date=18 Feb, away team=Leicester City, score=3-0.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: tie no 1, Leicester City (home), Man U (away), 1-2, 14 Feb.\n\nRow 1: tie no 2, Bolton W (home), Newcastle U (away), 3-3, 14 Feb.\n\nRows 2 and 3 are replays on 18 and 23 Feb:\n\nRow 2: date=18 Feb, home team=Newcastle U, away=Bolton W, score 0-0. So away team is Bolton W, not Leicester.\n\nRow 3: date=23 Feb, same as above but score 1-2.\n\nSo none of the matches on 18 Feb have Leicester City as the away team with a 3-0 score.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the \"tie no\" and replays. Maybe each initial tie is assigned a number, and replays are considered separate entries.\n\nLooking at tie no 1: Leicester vs Man U, 14 Feb, score 1-2.\n\nThen in replays, for example, row 3 (tie no 4?) or maybe the replays have their own numbering. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the table seems to have rows where \"tie no\" is followed by \"replay\". For example:\n\nRow 0: tie no 1\n\nRow 1: tie no 2\n\nThen row 2: replay (so tie no 3?), with Newcastle U as home, Bolton W away, 0-0 on 18 Feb.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: replay (tie no 4?), same teams, score 1-2 on 23 Feb.\n\nSo the initial ties are numbered 1 to 8, and then replays are additional entries for each tie.\n\nBut regardless of that, I'm looking for a match where:\n\n- Date is 18 February 1976\n\n- Away team is Leicester City\n\n- Score is 3-0\n\nLooking through all rows with date=18 Feb: only row 2 (tie no 3) and row 4 (tie no 4?), both are replays between Newcastle U and Bolton W, so away team isn't Leicester.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list out all the matches:\n\nDate 14 Feb 1976:\n\n1. Leicester City (home) vs Man U (away), score 1-2\n\n2. Bolton W (home) vs Newcastle U (away), 3-3\n\n3. Southend U vs Derby County, 0-1\n\n4. West Brom Albion vs Southampton, 1-1\n\n5. Derby County vs Southend U, 1-0\n\n6. Norwich City vs Bradford City, 2-1\n\n7. Chelsea vs Crystal Palace, 2-3\n\n8. Stoke City vs Sunderland, 0-0\n\nThen replays on 18 Feb:\n\nNewcastle U (home) vs Bolton W (away), score 0-0\n\nReplay: same teams, score 1-2\n\nSo none of these have Leicester as away team with a 3-0 score.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the rows. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: tie no 1, home: Leicester, away: Man U, date 14 Feb, score 1-2\n\nRow 1: tie no 2, Bolton W (home), Newcastle U (away), 3-3 on 14 Feb\n\nRow 2: replay, Newcastle U (home) vs Bolton W (away), 0-0 on 18 Feb\n\nRow 3: replay, same teams, score 1-2 on 23 Feb\n\nSo in the replays, no match has Leicester as away team.\n\nThus, there is no match on 18 Feb where the away team is Leicester City with a 3-0 score. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying if any football match occurred on February 18, 1976, with Leicester City as the away team and a final score of 3-0.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Initial Matches (14 Feb 1976):**\n   - 1. Leicester City (home) vs Manchester United (away), score 1-2.\n   - 2. Bolton Wanderers (home) vs Newcastle United (away), score 3-3.\n   - 3. Southend United (home) vs Derby County (away), score 0-1.\n   - 4. West Bromwich Albion (home) vs Southampton (away), score 1-1.\n   - 5. Derby County (home) vs Southend United (away), score 1-0.\n   - 6. Norwich City (home) vs Bradford City (away), score 2-1.\n   - 7. Chelsea (home) vs Crystal Palace (away), score 2-3.\n   - 8. Stoke City (home) vs Sunderland (away), score 0-0.\n\n2. **Replays on 18 Feb and 23 Feb:**\n   - **Row 2:** Newcastle United (home) vs Bolton Wanderers (away), score 0-0 on 18 Feb.\n   - **Row 3:** Same teams, score 1-2 on 23 Feb.\n\n**Conclusion:** No match on February 18, 1976, features Leicester City as the away team with a 3-0 victory. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** No such match occurred.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table lists various matches with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. The claim says: \"all game take place on 17 february 1976 or before 14 february 1976 or after and every game be a tie between 7 and 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand the claim in detail. It seems to suggest that all games either occurred on February 17th, 1976; before February 14th, 1976; or after, and also that each game was a tie with scores between 7-1. Wait, that part might need more attention.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple entries. The earliest date is 14 february 1976 for some matches (tie numbers 1,2,3,4,5,7,8). Then there are replays on 17 february and 23 february. So, the dates involved are 14th, 17th, and 23rd of February 1976.\n\nThe claim says all games take place on 17th Feb or before 14th Feb or after. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 17th is after 14th. If a game was on the 17th, it's after the 14th, but the claim includes both dates. But does \"after\" include the same day? Probably not. Also, there are games on 23rd Feb as well.\n\nWait, the claim says \"on 17 february 1976 or before 14 february 1976 or after.\" So that would mean either 17th, before 14th (so earlier dates), or after some later date? But in this table, all games are either on 14th, 17th, or 23rd. So, let's check each game's date.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Tie 1: 14 Feb\n- Tie 2: 14 Feb\n- Replay 1: 18 Feb (but since it's a replay, is that considered a separate game?)\nWait, the structure of the table has tie numbers and replay entries. For example, tie 2 is Bolton vs Newcastle on 14th, then there's a replay on 18th and another on 23rd.\n\nBut each entry in the table is a single game, right? So tie 1 is Leicester vs Man U 1-2 on 14th Feb. Then, the replays are additional games. So all games listed have dates either 14th, 17th, or 23rd.\n\nSo the claim says that each game takes place on 17th Feb, before 14th (which would be earlier than 14th), or after, but in this table, all games except the replays are on 14th. The replays are on 18th and 23rd. So some games are on 17th, 18th, 23rd.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"all game take place on 17 february 1976 or before 14 february 1976 or after.\" So that would mean each game is either on 17 Feb, before 14 Feb (which isn't possible because you can't have a date earlier than 14th in this context), or after. But since all dates are either 14th, 17th, or 23rd, the only relevant part is 17th and 23rd.\n\nWait, but the claim's phrasing is confusing. It says \"on 17 february... or before... or after.\" So maybe it means that each game was on 17th Feb, or if not, then either before 14th or after some other date (like 14th). But in this table, most games are on the 14th, which is a specific date.\n\nAlso, regarding the second part of the claim: \"every game be a tie between 7 and 1.\" Looking at the scores:\n\n- Tie 1: 1 - 2 (not a tie)\n- Tie 2: 3 - 3 (tie)\n- Replay 1: 0 - 0 (tie)\n- Replay 2: 1 - 2 (not a tie)\n- Tie 3: 3 - 0 (not a tie)\n- Tie 4: 1 - 1 (tie)\n- Replay 3: 4 - 0 (not a tie)\n- Tie 5: 1 - 0 (not a tie)\n- Tie 6: 1 - 2 (not a tie)\n- Tie 7: 2 - 3 (not a tie)\n- Tie 8: 0 - 0 (tie)\n- Replay 4: 2 - 1 (not a tie)\n\nSo, only some of the games are ties. The claim says every game is a tie between 7 and 1. Wait, that would mean all scores must be in the format like 7-1, 1-7, etc., but looking at the table, most scores aren't even close to that.\n\nFor example, the score for Tie 1 is 1-2, which isn't a tie between 7 and 1. Similarly, Tie 3 is 3-0, which doesn't fit either. So this part of the claim seems to be false because not every game is a tie at all, let alone in the specific score range mentioned.\n\nPutting it together: The claim has two parts\u2014dates and scores. \n\nFor dates:\n- Some games are on 14th Feb (which is one day), others on 17th and 23rd.\n- The claim says \"on 17th or before 14th or after.\" Since 17th is after 14th, the only way this makes sense is if all games are either on 17th or before 14th. But in the table, many games are on 14th, which is neither before nor on 17th. So that part is incorrect.\n\nFor scores:\n- Most games aren't even ties, let alone with a score between 7 and 1.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's assertion about all games being tied between 7-1 and occurring on specific dates isn't supported by the table. Many matches are not ties, and their dates don't align with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Chelsea isn't involved.\n- Row 2: Bolton Wanderers (home), Newcastle United (away). Not related.\n- Row 3: Wolves (home), Charlton Athletic (away). No.\n- Row 4: West Brom (home), Southampton (away).

No.\n- Row 7: Chelsea is away? Wait, row 7 has Chelsea as home team vs. Crystal Palace as away. So that's Chelsea at home, not away when Sunderland is home. Not relevant for the first condition.\n- Row 8: Stoke City is home, Sunderland is away. So this matches the second part of the claim where Stoke City is home and Southampton isn't involved here. But we need to check if Chelsea was away when Sunderland was home.\n\nWait, but in row 8, the home team is Stoke City, not Sunderland. So that doesn't help for the first condition.\n\nLooking back at the table, I don't see any matches where Chelsea is the away team and Sunderland is the home team. Let me check all rows:\n\nRow 1: Leicester vs Man Utd.\nRow 2: Bolton vs Newcastle.\nRow 3: Wolves vs Charlton.\nRow 4: West Brom vs Southampton.\nRow 5: Derby vs Southend.\nRow 6: Norwich vs Bradford.\nRow7: Chelsea vs Crystal Palace (Chelsea is home, so if any match has Chelsea away and Sunderland home, it's not here).\nRow8: Stoke City vs Sunderland. Here, Stoke is home, Sunderland is away. So in this case, the home team is Stoke, which doesn't help for the first condition.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each row again:\n\nLooking for when Chelsea is away and Sundering is home. That would be a match where \"home team\" is Sunderland and \"away team\" is Chelsea. From the table, does any such entry exist?\n\nIn the given table, the only matches involving Sunderland are rows 8 (Sunderland home vs Stoke) and row 8's replay. In both cases, Sunderland is home but not against Chelsea.\n\nSo, there's no match where Chelsea is away and Sundering is home. Therefore, the first part of the claim isn't met.\n\nBut let me check the second condition again: Stoke City as home when Southampton is away. Looking at row 4: West Brom (home) vs Southampton (away). That's one, but it doesn't involve Stoke.\n\nRow 8: Stoke is home, Sundering is away. But in that case, Chelsea isn't involved. So the second condition would be if a match has Stoke as home and Southampton as away. The only such match is row4 where West Brom is home vs Southampton away. There's no match where Stoke is home and Southampton is away.\n\nWait, but in row4: West Brom is home, Southampton is away. That matches the second part of the claim if the condition was Stoke being home when Southampton is away. But it's not. So that doesn't help.\n\nTherefore, neither the first nor the second conditions are met by any row in the table.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim says both Chelsea should be away when Sundering is home and Stoke should be home when Southampton is away.

There should be a match where Manchester United is the away team with a score of 0-0.\n2. In another match, Norwich City is the home team with a score of 2-1.\n\nI'll start by examining each row in the table to find matches that fit these conditions.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: Leicester vs Manchester United (score 1-2). Away team is Man U but score isn't 0-0. Doesn't fit.\nRow 2: Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle (3-3). Not relevant.\nRow 3: Wolves vs Charlton (3-0). Not relevant.\nRow 4: West Brom vs Southampton (1-1). No.\nRows 5-8: None of these have Man U as away with 0-0 or Norwich as home with 2-1.\n\nThen, looking at the replays:\nReplay row: Newcastle vs Bolton (0-0). Not relevant. Next replay: Bolton vs Newcastle (1-2). No.\n\nWait, I might be missing something. Let me check each match carefully.\n\nWait, in Row 6: Norwich City is the home team against Bradford City with a score of 1-2. That's not 2-1, so that doesn't fit the second condition.\n\nLooking further, the table only goes up to row 8 and some replays. I don't see any match where Norwich City is the home team with a 2-1 score. Similarly, Manchester United as away with 0-0 isn't present either.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a replay? Let me check again. The replays are:\n\nRow 3: Replay on 17th Feb: Southamton 4 vs West Brom 0. No.\nRow 7 and 8 have replays that don't match.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another row beyond what's shown here, but according to the table provided, I don't see any such matches.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking for away team = Manchester United and score=0-0.\n\nIn Row 1: Man U is away with 1-2. Not 0-0.\nAny other rows where Man U is away? Checking further down, in the replays, the only Man U match is in Row 1.\n\nNo matches have Man U as away with 0-0.\n\nFor Norwich City as home with score 2-1: Looking through each row:\n\nRow 6: Norwich is home vs Bradford, score 1-2. Not 2-1.\nAny other rows where Norwich is home? No, only Row 6 and possibly a replay if any. But in the table, after Row 8, there are replays for Bolton-Newcastle but not Norwich.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim aren't met. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires two specific matches: one where Manchester United is away with a 0-0 score and another where Norwich City is home with a 2-1 score. Neither of these exists in the provided table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
