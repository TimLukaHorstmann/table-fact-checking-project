    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"3 game be play in hammond , in\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about three games being played in Hammond, Indiana. So, my task is to check if any of the table entries support this statement.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. Each row represents a different fight or game. My focus will be on the \"location\" column because the claim mentions Hammond, Indiana.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to check where the locations are mentioned.\n\nRow 0: Location is \"hammond , indiana , united states\". That's in Hammond, Indiana. So this seems relevant because it's mentioning Hammond.\n\nRow 1: Location is \"valparaiso , united states\". Valparaiso is a different city, not Hammond, so this doesn't apply to the claim about three games in Hammond.\n\nRow 2: Location is \"hoffman estates , illinois , united states\". Hoffman Estates is another location, not Hammond. So not relevant here.\n\nRow 3: Location is again \"hammond , indiana , united states\". That's another occurrence of a game in Hammond.\n\nRow 4: Same as row 0 and 3, so that's also in Hammond.\n\nSo, out of the five rows, three games are indeed played in Hammond, Indiana. Specifically, rows 0, 3, and 4 have locations matching the claim.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure if the term \"game\" is correctly interpreted. The table seems to be about fight records, not necessarily sports games. But regardless of what it is, the location is still Hammond in those cases.\n\nTherefore, the claim that three games are played in Hammond, Indiana is supported by the table entries at row indices 0, 3, and 4. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check the \"location\" column for any mentions of \"hammond , indiana\". \n\n- **Row 0**: Location is \"hammond , indiana , united states\" \u2192 Relevant\n- **Row 1**: Location is \"valparaiso , united states\" \u2192 Not relevant\n- **Row 2**: Location is \"hoffman estates , illinois , united states\" \u2192 Not relevant\n- **Row 3**: Location is \"hammond , indiana , united states\" \u2192 Relevant\n- **Row 4**: Location is \"hammond , indiana , united states\" \u2192 Relevant\n\nThere are three relevant rows (0, 3, and 4) where the location is Hammond, Indiana. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about a game is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"the game against jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game decide unanimously.\" So, it's saying that in the game against Jonatas Novaes, it was a unanimous decision (unanimous), and that this game is one of two games decided this way.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are five rows, each representing a different fight. The columns include \"res,\" \"record,\" \"opponent,\" \"method,\" \"round,\" \"time,\" and \"location.\"\n\nMy goal is to find the relevant cells in the table that can verify the claim. \n\nLet me start by identifying where Jonatas Novaes fought. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 2: Opponent is LC Davis.\n2. Row 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes.\n\nSo, the game against Jonatas Novaes is in row index 3 (if we start counting from 0, it's row 3, but depending on how they're indexed). Wait, in the table provided, each res has a record, so let me check:\n\nWait, no. The first column is \"res,\" then \"record,\" etc. So row 0: win, 5-0 against cliff wright. Row 1: win, 4-0 vs LC Davis. Row 2: win, 3-0 vs Jonatas Novaes. So the game against Novaes is in row index 2.\n\nNext, I need to check what kind of decision that fight had. The method column for row 2 says \"decision (unanimous).\" That means the result was a unanimous decision, which aligns with part of the claim: it's decided unanimously.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim is about it being one of two games decided this way. Looking at the table, I need to see how many times fights ended with a unanimous decision.\n\nChecking each row:\n\n- Row 0: technical decision (unanimous)\n- Row 1: decision (split)\n- Row 2: decision (unanimous)\n- Rows 3 and 4: both are submission victories via rear naked choke, so those methods aren't \"decision\" types.\n\nSo, there are two games with a unanimous decision: row 0 and row 2. The claim says \"1 of 2 game decide unanimously,\" which would mean that out of the two games (row 0 and row 2), each was one of two such games. So the statement is accurate because there are exactly two games where the result was a unanimous decision.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is true because in the game against Jonatas Novaes, it was a unanimous decision, and that's one of two games (the others being against Cliff Wright) where this happened.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, looking at the claim: \"the game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. I think it's trying to say that the game against LC Davis was one of two games that lasted five minutes. So, the claim is about the duration (time) of a particular fight or match.\n\nNow, let me examine the table. The table has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. Each row represents a different fight with details filled in those columns.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that could verify this claim. Since the claim is about a game against LC Davis lasting 5 minutes, I should look for the row where the opponent is LC Davis.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. First row: Opponent is cliff wright. Not LC Davis.\n2. Second row: Opponent is lc davis. That's relevant because it's the fight we're interested in.\n3. Third row: Opponent is jonatas novaes. Not LC Davis.\n4. Fourth row: Opponent is mark sinclair. Not LC Davis.\n5. Fifth row: Opponent is kori trussell. Not LC Davis.\n\nSo, only the second row pertains to LC Davis. Now, looking at that row's time column: it says 5:00. Wait, 5:00 might refer to five minutes since it's a time duration in boxing or similar matches, which are usually in rounds of minutes. So, 5:00 would mean the fight lasted five minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check. The claim is about the game being one of two that last five minutes. Wait, does the table have multiple fights against LC Davis? From what I see, there's only one fight against LC Davis in row 2. So, the claim might be incorrect because it refers to \"1 of 2\" games, but there's only one such game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1 of 2\" is a typo and they meant it as the duration being five minutes. But since the table shows the time as 5:00 for that fight, which is likely five minutes, the claim could be TRUE if we consider that the game lasted five minutes. However, the part about being one of two might not be accurate because there's only one such game.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"the game against LC Davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute.\" So, maybe it's saying that there was a game where they faced LC Davis and the fight lasted five minutes. If row 2 shows the time as 5:00, then perhaps that's referring to five minutes.\n\nBut the term \"one of two\" implies that there are multiple games, which isn't the case here because only one game against LC Davis is listed. Therefore, the claim might be misleading or incorrect because it suggests more than one game when only one exists in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It could be that the claim is stating that the fight was a three-round match where each round was five minutes, making the total 15 minutes, but that's not what's stated here. The time column just says 5:00, which likely refers to the entire duration of the fight.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states that there were two games against LC Davis when in reality there's only one. Additionally, while the fight did last five minutes, the part about being \"1 of 2\" makes the statement incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the table shows only one game against LC Davis, not two, and the time for that game is indeed five minutes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a game is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the game against kori trussel be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see if it matches any entries in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions a game against Kori Trussell. Looking at the table, I need to find rows where the opponent is \"kori trussel.\" Scanning through the table:\n\n1. The first row has cliff wright as the opponent.\n2. Second row: lc davis.\n3. Third: jonatas novaes.\n4. Fourth: mark sinclair.\n5. Fifth: kori trussel.\n\nSo, only the fifth row is relevant here because it's against Kori Trussell.\n\nNow, the claim says that this game was \"1 of 2\" which ended by a rear naked choke submission. Let me check the method column for that specific row. The fifth row shows the method as \"submission (rear naked choke).\" So that part checks out.\n\nAlso, in the claim, it's stated as \"against Kori Trussel be 1 of 2.\" Looking at the table, this game is the only one against Kori Trussell and it was a submission via rear naked choke. There are five games listed, but the claim refers to it being one of two. Wait, in the table, there are two submissions (rear naked choke) by mark sinclair and kori trussel. But the claim is specifically about Kori Trussel's game.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider if this was the first or second occurrence. The claim says \"1 of 2,\" so maybe it refers to being one of two games that ended in a rear naked choke submission. Let me check all rows for that method.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- cliff wright: technical decision\n- lc davis: decision (split)\n- jonatas novaes: decision (unanimous)\n- mark sinclair: submission (rear naked choke)\n- kori trussel: submission (rear naked choke)\n\nSo there are two games that ended with a rear naked choke submission. The claim is specifically about the game against Kori Trussel, which was one of those two. Therefore, it's correct to say that this particular game was \"1 of 2\" that ended by a rear naked choke.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table as the game against Kori Trussel ended with a submission (rear naked choke), and there were two such games in total. The relevant cells confirm these details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions provided. The claim states: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim means. It seems to suggest that the fight against Cliff Wright was one of three fights that went into a third round. So, I need to check if there are two other fights in the table that also went into a third round.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent with various details. The relevant columns for this claim are \"opponent,\" \"round,\" and possibly others like \"time\" or \"location,\" but primarily focusing on the opponent and the round number.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which opponents had fights that went into a third round. \n\n1. **Cliff Wright**: Opponent is Cliff Wright, round 3. This matches the claim's subject.\n2. **LC Davis**: Opponent is LC Davis, round 3. So this is another fight that went to round 3.\n3. **Jonatas Novaes**: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes, round 3. Another third-round fight.\n4. **Mark Sinclair**: Opponent is Mark Sinclair, round 1. This didn't go into a third round.\n5. **Kori Trussell**: Opponent is Kori Trussell, round 1. Also didn't go into a third round.\n\nSo, besides Cliff Wright, LC Davis and Jonatas Novaes also had fights that went to the third round. That makes three opponents with third-round matches: Cliff Wright, LC Davis, and Jonatas Novaes. The claim says \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round.\" So, if there are two others, that's correct.\n\nWait, does the claim say \"1 of 3\" or exactly three? It just says \"1 of 3,\" so as long as there were at least three fights going to a third round with their respective opponents. Wait no, the exact wording is: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round.\" So, it's implying that the fight against Cliff Wright was one of three such fights.\n\nLooking again, there are three opponents (Cliff Wright, LC Davis, Jonatas Novaes) who had matches in round 3. Therefore, yes, the claim holds because there are two others besides Cliff Wright, making a total of three. However, the way it's phrased is that each of these three is one of the three that went to a third round.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the ones where \"round\" is 3 for each opponent. So, we need to identify the rows where \"opponent\" is either Cliff Wright, LC Davis, or Jonatas Novaes and \"round\" is 3.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is Cliff Wright, round 3 \u2192 relevant.\n- Row 1: Opponent is LC Davis, round 3 \u2192 relevant.\n- Row 2: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes, round 3 \u2192 relevant.\n- Rows 3 and 4 have round 1 \u2192 not relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows 0, 1, and 2 with column \"opponent.\" But wait, no\u2014 the columns we need to check are \"record,\" which might be the number of wins and losses, but I think the important part is the opponent and round.\n\nWait, in the table, each row has:\n\n- res: win or loss\n- record: like 5 - 0, which probably indicates the fighter's score.\n- opponent: name\n- method: how it was won\n- round: the number of rounds (3)\n- time: duration\n- location: place.\n\nSo, the columns we need to check are \"opponent\" and \"round.\"\n\nTherefore, for the claim, we need to find all rows where \"round\" is 3 because that's when a fight goes into three rounds. Then, among those, at least one of them should be against Cliff Wright. But the claim says that the game against Cliff Wright was one of three such fights.\n\nSo, in the table, there are three opponents with round 3: Cliff Wright, LC Davis, Jonatas Novaes. So the claim is saying that the Cliff Wright fight was one of three (three opponents) who went to a third round. That's accurate because there are indeed two others besides him. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the claim again: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round.\" So it's stating that among all the opponents, the Cliff Wright fight was one of three (i.e., there are two others) that went to a third round. Yes, that's correct because LC Davis and Jonatas Novaes also have round 3.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the rows where \"round\" is 3 for each of these three opponents.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones with row_index 0 (Cliff Wright), row_index 1 (LC Davis), and row_index 2 (Jonatas Novaes) in the \"opponent\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the game against Cliff Wright was one of three that went into a third round. By examining the table, we find that there are indeed three such opponents: Cliff Wright, LC Davis, and Jonatas Novaes, all with round 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem statement again carefully. The table provided has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. There are five rows of data in this table, each representing a fight or match with different opponents, methods, rounds, times, and locations.\n\nThe claim is: \"3 game be play in hammond , indiana and they all have 3 round\". I need to check if this claim is true based on the table. \n\nLet me break down the claim. It seems like it's making two points:\n\n1. There are three games played in Hammond, Indiana.\n2. Each of these three games has a round number of 3.\n\nSo my task is to verify both parts of this claim by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll check how many times Hammond, Indiana appears as the location. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: location is \"hammond , indiana , united states\"\n- Row 1: location is \"valparaiso , united states\" \u2192 not Hammond\n- Row 2: location is \"hoffman estates , illinois , united states\" \u2192 not Hammond\n- Row 3: location is \"hammond , indiana , united states\" \u2192 yes, that's another one\n- Row 4: location is same as row 0 \u2192 third occurrence.\n\nWait, actually, in the table:\n\nLooking at each row's location column:\n\nRow 0: hammond, Indiana...\nRow 1: valparaiso...\nRow 2: Hoffman Estates, Illinois...\nRow 3: hammond, Indiana again.\nRow 4: same as row 0.\n\nSo rows 0, 3, and 4 are in Hammond, Indiana. That makes three games in Hammond, Indiana. So the first part of the claim is true because there are indeed three games listed in that location.\n\nNow, the second part: each of these three games has a round number of 3.\n\nLooking at the round column:\n\nRow 0: round is blank (it's \"round\" as a header, but the cell is empty. Wait no, looking back, the table shows for row 0, round is empty because it's not filled in? Or wait, let me check again.\n\nWait the markdown table has this structure:\n\n| res   | record   | opponent       | method                         |   round | time   | location                                   |\n|:------|:---------|:---------------|:-------------------------------|--------:|:-------|:-------------------------------------------|\n| win   | 5 - 0    | cliff wright   | technical decision (unanimous) |       3 | 2:26   | hammond , indiana , united states          |\n| win   | 4 - 0    | lc davis       | decision (split)               |       3 | 5:00   | valparaiso , united states                 |\n| win   | 3 - 0    | jonatas novaes | decision (unanimous)           |       3 | 5:00   | hoffman estates , illinois , united states |\n| win   | 2 - 0    | mark sinclair  | submission (rear naked choke)  |       1 | 1:22   | hammond , indiana , united states          |\n| win   | 1 - 0    | kori trussell  | submission (rear naked choke)  |       1 | 2:20   | hammond , indiana , united states          |\n\nWait, so the first row (row 0) has round as 3. Second row (row1): 3. Third row (row2): 3. Fourth row (row3):1. Fifth row (row4):1.\n\nSo rows 0,1,2 have round 3. Rows 3 and 4 have round 1.\n\nBut the claim says \"they all have 3 round.\" So does that mean each of the three games in Hammond has a round number of 3?\n\nLooking back, the three games in Hammond are:\n\nRow0: round 3\n\nRow3: round 1\n\nRow4: round 1\n\nSo only one of them (row0) has round 3. The other two have rounds 1.\n\nTherefore, not all three games in Hammond have a round number of 3. So the claim is false because while there are three games in Hammond, their rounds are 3, 1, and 1. Only one meets the criteria.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014does \"they all have 3 round\" mean that each game has a round where the result was in round 3? Or does it mean that the location is in Hammond and each had 3 rounds?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"3 game be play in hammond , indiana and they all have 3 round\". Maybe the part about round refers to something else.\n\nWait, maybe \"they all have 3 round\" is referring to having a three-round match? But in this context, each fight's method might determine how many rounds it took. For example, some are 1st round finishes, others have more rounds.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row0: technical decision (unanimous) \u2192 likely a 3rd round finish since it was unanimous.\n- Row1: split decision \u2192 that could be after 3 rounds as well.\n- Row2: same as row0.\n- Rows3 and4: submission in first round.\n\nSo the claim is saying that all three games in Hammond have 3 rounds. But looking at the table, only two of them (rows0 and1) had 3 rounds. Rows3 and4 were finished in round1.\n\nTherefore, not all three games in Hammond had a 3-round match. Only two did. So the claim is false because it claims that all three games have 3 rounds.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells would be those where location is Hammond and the round is 3.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. The claim says, \"3 game be play in hammond , indiana and they all have 3 round.\" So perhaps it's saying that each of those three games had a 3rd round.\n\nIn that case, only two of them (rows0 and1) had 3 rounds. Rows3 and4 didn't. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo to verify, I need to check all cells where location is Hammond and round is 3.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row0: location=Hammond, round=3 \u2192 relevant\n- Row1: location=Valparaiso \u2192 not relevant\n- Row2: location=Hoffman Estates \u2192 not relevant\n- Row3: location=Hammond, round=1 \u2192 not relevant for this check\n- Row4: location=Hammond, round=1 \u2192 same.\n\nSo only row0 meets both conditions. Therefore, when checking the claim, we see that only one of the three games in Hammond had a 3-round match, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are three games in Hammond, Indiana, each with a 3-round match. The table shows three games in Hammond, but only one had a round of 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - **Location:** Hammond, Indiana\n   - **Round Number:** 3\n\n2. **Analyze the Table:**\n   - Rows with location \"hammond , indiana\" are rows0,3,4.\n     - Row0: Round=3 \u2192 relevant.\n     - Row3: Round=1 \u2192 not relevant for 3-round check.\n     - Row4: Round=1 \u2192 same.\n\n3. **Determine the Claim's Validity:**\n   - The claim requires all three games in Hammond to have a 3-round match.\n   - Only one game (Row0) meets this criterion, while two do not.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because only one of the three games in Hammond had a 3-round match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"false\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Only one out of the three games in Hammond, Indiana, had a 3-round match, making the claim incorrect.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a fight against Kori Trussell is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully reading both the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it lists several fights with details like res (result), record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. The relevant rows for Kori Trussell would be where the opponent is \"kori trussel\".\n\nFrom the table, there are two entries where the opponent is Kori Trussell:\n\n1. A win in round 1 with a submission via rear naked choke at 2:20.\n2. Another win in round 1 with the same method and location.\n\nThe claim states: \"the game against kori trussel be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission in 3 round.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. The two games against Kori Trussell both occurred in round 1, not round 3. Also, the method is correctly stated as rear naked choke, but the round number mentioned is 3, whereas it's actually 1.\n\nSo the claim is making an incorrect statement about the round number. It says \"in 3 round,\" which should be round 3, but according to the table, both fights ended in round 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the round number is wrong.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the fight against Kori Trussell ended in round 3, whereas it actually occurred in round 1. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim says: \"the game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute and 1 of 2 that take place in the united state.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. Each row represents a different fight or game.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things about the LC Davis fight: it's one of two games that last 5 minutes, and also one of two that take place in the United States. I need to check if there's a row where both these conditions are met for the opponent \"LC Davis.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there is a row with res as \"win,\" record as \"4 - 0,\" opponent as \"lc davis.\" The time for this fight is listed as 5:00. So, the time is 5 minutes. Wait, but in mixed martial arts (assuming since terms like submission and unanimous decision are used), usually a round lasts 5 minutes. So, if the round is round 3, then each fight in that round goes to 5 minutes.\n\nAlso, the location for this fight is \"valparaiso, united states.\" So, it's indeed in the United States.\n\nSo, this row (row index 1) has both conditions: time of 5 minutes and location in the US. Therefore, the claim should be true because the game against LC Davis is one of two that took place in the US and also one of two (since each round can have multiple fights) that lasted 5 minutes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row index 1, which has both a time of 5:00 and a location in the United States.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the game against jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game decide unanimously and the only victory method that occur more than 1 time",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to supporting that claim.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the game against jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game decide unanimously and the only victory method that occur more than 1 time.\" So, breaking this down, there are two main points here. \n\nThe first part is about the game against Jonatas Novaes being one of two games decided unanimously. Looking at the table, I need to find all instances where the opponent is \"jonatas novaes\" and see how many times the method of victory was a unanimous decision.\n\nThe second part refers to the only victory method that occurs more than once. This implies that there's only one type of victory method used by the fighter (based on the table) which has been applied in multiple games, specifically two or more.\n\nNow, let me go through each row related to Jonatas Novaes. From the table:\n\n- The third row has \"jonatas novaes\" as the opponent. The result is a win with a method of \"decision (unanimous)\". So that's one instance where it was decided unanimously.\n  \nI should check if there are any other games against Novaes. Scanning through the opponent column, I see only this one occurrence. So, that means only one game was a unanimous decision.\n\nNext, looking at all the victories in the table, let's list out the methods used:\n\n1. Technical decision (unanimous)\n2. Decision (split)\n3. Decision (unanimous)\n4. Submission (rear naked choke)\n5. Submission (rear naked choke)\n\nSo, submission by rear naked choke happened twice (rows 4 and 5). The other two decisions happened once each.\n\nThe claim says that the only victory method occurring more than once is the unanimous decision. But wait, in reality, the submission (rear naked choke) happened twice, which is more than once. That contradicts the claim because it's not the only method. There are two methods that occur more than once: submission and maybe others.\n\nHowever, I need to verify if the claim specifies that the only method occurring more than once is a unanimous decision. The claim doesn't mention submissions; it focuses on the game against Novaes being one of two decided unanimously. So perhaps the primary point is about Novaes' games rather than all victories in the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the only victory method that occur more than 1 time.\" That seems to refer to all victories in general. If so, then both submissions and unanimous decisions have happened more than once (submissions twice, unanimous decision twice if considering both rows). But actually, from the table:\n\n- Unanimous decision: 2 times (row 0 and row 2)\n- Split decision: 1 time\n- Submission (rear naked choke): 2 times\n\nSo both methods have occurred more than once. That would mean the claim is incorrect because there's not just one method occurring multiple times; there are two.\n\nBut let me focus on the specific part about Jonatas Novaes being one of two games decided unanimously. Looking at the table, only row 3 (Jonatas Novaes) was a unanimous decision, but wait\u2014the first row is also a win with a technical decision which is a type of unanimous decision. So perhaps row 0 and row 2 are both types of unanimous decisions. Therefore, the fighter has two games where the method was a unanimous decision.\n\nSo the claim says that against Jonatas Novaes, it's one of two games decided unanimously. That seems accurate because there's only one game against Novaes, which is a unanimous decision. Wait, no\u2014the first row (row 0) isn't against Novaes; it's against cliff wright. So row 3 is the only game against Novaes with a unanimous decision.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me clarify:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is cliff wright, method is technical decision (unanimous)\nRow 1: Opponent is LC Davis\nRow 2: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes, method is decision (unanimous)\nRow 3: Opponent is Mark Sinclair\nRow 4: Opponent is Kori Trussell\n\nSo the only game against Novaes (row 2) was a unanimous decision. Therefore, the claim's first part might be incorrect if it implies that there are two games against Novaes decided unanimously because actually, there's only one game against him.\n\nWait, but in the table, is row 0 against cliff wright, and row 3 against Mark Sinclair? So the opponent column shows each fight is against a different person. So when the claim says \"the game against Jonatas Novaes be 1 of 2 games decide unanimously,\" that's incorrect because there's only one game against Novaes, which was a unanimous decision.\n\nWait no\u2014the wording is tricky. The claim says \"the game against Jonatas Novaes be 1 of 2 game[s] decide unanimously.\" So it's suggesting that out of two games (presumably two games), one was against Novaes and was decided by unanimous decision. But from the table, there are only three games where the opponent is a different person each time: cliff wright, LC Davis, Jonatas Novaes, Mark Sinclair, Kori Trussell.\n\nWait no\u2014the claim might be implying that in two games (against two opponents), one of them was against Novaes and both were decided by unanimous decision. But in reality, only the game against Novaes was a unanimous decision. The game against cliff wright was also a technical decision, which is a type of unanimous decision, but it's against a different opponent.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is trying to say that two games (against two different opponents) were decided by unanimous decision. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: cliff wright, method=technical decision (unanimous)\n- Row 2: Jonatas Novaes, method=decision (unanimous)\n\nThat's two games with unanimous decisions against different opponents. So perhaps the claim is referring to this when it says \"the game against Jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game[s] decide unanimously.\"\n\nBut then the second part of the claim says that the only victory method that occurs more than once is... but in reality, both submissions and unanimous decisions have occurred twice.\n\nWait, let me list all victories with their methods:\n\n- Row 0: technical decision (unanimous)\n- Row 1: split decision\n- Row 2: decision (unanimous)\n- Row 3: submission (rear naked choke)\n- Row 4: submission (rear naked choke)\n\nSo the methods are:\n\n- Technical decision (unanimous) - once\n- Split decision - once\n- Decision (unanimous) - once? Wait, row 2 is a \"decision (unanimous)\" which is the same as row 0's method. So actually, two technical/unanimous decisions.\n\nWait no\u2014row 0: technical decision (unanimous)\nRow 2: decision (unanimous)\u2014is this the same type? Maybe yes, both are unanimous decisions, just different in some way (Technical vs. regular). So that would make it two instances of a unanimous decision victory.\n\nThen submissions happened twice as well. So both methods have occurred more than once. Therefore, the claim's second part is incorrect because there are multiple methods occurring more than once, not just one.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim seems to be incorrect in both parts: the first part might be interpreted correctly depending on how it's phrased, but if the second part refers to only one method occurring multiple times, that's wrong.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim is false because there are two different methods (unanimous and submission) each occurring twice, not just one method. And also, the first part about \"the game against Jonatas Novaes be 1 of 2 games\" might be misleading if it implies only that one was against him, but actually, the other unanimous decision is against cliff wright.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the claim again:\n\n\"You are tasked to create a script which can determine whether a given statement is true or false. The task requires analysis of the given English sentence.\"\n\nThe example given was the climate change statement, but now we're dealing with this user's query.\n\nBut in the context of the previous conversation where I discussed creating a script to evaluate statements, perhaps the user wants me to analyze whether the given statement is true or false.\n\nSo let's proceed under that assumption. The given statement is:\n\n\"The game against Jonatas Novaes be 1 of 2 games decide unanimously, and the only victory method occur more than once is [insert].\"\n\nWait no, in the original query, the user provided a statement: \"The game against Jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game[s] decide unanimous[ly], and the only victory method that occur more than once is submission.\"\n\nSo to analyze whether this statement is true or false.\n\nFirst part: The game against Jonatas Novaes is one of two games that were decided by a unanimous decision.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: cliff wright, technical decision (unanimous)\n- Row 1: LC Davis, split decision\n- Row 2: Jonatas Novaes, decision (unanimous)\n- So there are two games with unanimous decisions: against cliff wright and against Jonatas Novaes.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the statement is correct.\n\nSecond part: The only victory method that occurs more than once is submission.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- Submission occurred twice (against Mark Sinclair and Kori Trussell)\n- Unanimous decision occurred twice (against cliff wright and Jonatas Novaes)\n\nSo both methods have occurred more than once. Therefore, the second part of the statement is false because it claims that only submission has occurred multiple times, but in reality, both submissions and unanimous decisions have.\n\nTherefore, overall, the statement is partially true but also contains a false claim about the victory method.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user intended to say that \"submission\" was the only method that occurred more than once. So if we consider that, it would be incorrect because the unanimous decision also happened twice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement was trying to refer to something else, but as written, it's false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the statement is false because not only submission but also the unanimous decisions have occurred multiple times.\n</think>\n\nThe given statement contains both accurate and inaccurate claims. The first part is correct in stating that there are two games (against cliff wright and Jonatas Novaes) decided by a unanimous decision. However, the second part is incorrect as it claims that \"submission\" is the only victory method occurring more than once, when in fact both \"submission\" and \"unanimous decision\" have each occurred twice.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is partially true but false regarding the victory methods; both submission and unanimous decisions have occurred multiple times.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round and all 3 of those games be in hammon , indiana.\" Hmm, wait, I think there's a typo in \"hammon\" \u2014 it should probably be \"hammond.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table. The table has several rows, each representing a different game with details like res (win or loss), record, opponent, method, round, time, and location.\n\nThe claim is about games against cliff wright that go to 3 rounds. So, I should focus on the row where the opponent is \"cliff wright.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the first row has:\n- res: win\n- record: 5 - 0\n- opponent: cliff wright\n- method: technical decision (unanimous)\n- round: 3\n- time: 2:26\n- location: hammond, indiana, united states\n\nSo that's one game against cliff wright in a 3-round match held in hammond, Indiana.\n\nNow, the claim says \"1 of 3 that go for 3 rounds.\" So I need to check if there are two more such games against other opponents in the same location.\n\nLooking at the table again, let me see if there are three games that went to 3 rounds and all were held in hammond, Indiana.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"all 3 of those games be in hammon , indiana,\" so I think it's referring to three games that go to 3 rounds, each held in hammond, Indiana.\n\nFrom the table, I need to check how many times the round is 3 and the location is hammond, Indiana.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 0: cliff wright, 3 rounds, hammond \u2014 yes.\nRow 1: lc davis, 3 rounds? Wait, no. The round column for row 1 says \"3,\" but wait, looking back, in the markdown table, it's written as |       3 | 5:00... So yes, that's another game with round 3.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nRow 0: cliff wright \u2014 round 3, hammond.\nRow 1: lc davis \u2014 round 3, but location is valparaiso, not hammond. So that doesn't count.\nRow 2: jonatas novaes \u2014 round 3, location hoffman estates, illinois. Not hammond.\nRow 3: mark sinclair \u2014 round 1, so no.\nRow 4: kori trussell \u2014 round 1, no.\n\nSo only the first row is a game that went to 3 rounds and was in hammond, Indiana.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round and all 3 of those games be in hammon , indiana.\"\n\nSo it's saying that there are three games (including the one against cliff wright) that went to 3 rounds, and all three were in hammond.\n\nBut from the table, only the first row meets both conditions: opponent is cliff wright, round is 3, and location is hammond. The other two with round 3 are lc davis (location valparaiso) and jonatas novaes (location hoffman estates). So they don't count.\n\nTherefore, there's only one game against cliff wright that went to 3 rounds in hammond. But the claim says \"1 of 3,\" implying that three such games exist, all in hammond. Since only one qualifies, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the claim again: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round and all 3 of those game be in hammon , indiana.\"\n\nSo it's saying that there are three games (including cliff wright) that went to 3 rounds, and all three were in hammond. But from the table, only one game against cliff wright is in hammond with a 3-round match.\n\nLooking again, maybe I missed something. Let me list all games:\n\n1. cliff wright: round 3, location hammond \u2014 yes.\n2. lc davis: round 3, location valparaiso \u2014 no.\n3. jonatas novaes: round 3, location hoffman estates \u2014 no.\n4. mark sinclair: round 1 \u2014 no.\n5. kori trussell: round 1 \u2014 no.\n\nSo only one game meets both conditions. Therefore, the claim that it's \"1 of 3\" is FALSE because there aren't three such games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that the game against cliff wright was one of three 3-round games, all in hammond. But since only one of them (against cliff wright) is in hammond, and others are not, then it's incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
