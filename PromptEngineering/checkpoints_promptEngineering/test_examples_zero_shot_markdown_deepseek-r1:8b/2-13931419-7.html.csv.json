    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is about a specific game between the penguins and the blue team on March 6th having an attendance of 9092.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, and points. Each row corresponds to a different game. My task is to find the relevant cells that support or contradict the claim.\n\nI'll start by locating March 6th in the table. Scanning through the dates: march 2, 6, 7, etc., I see that March 6th is the second row (index 1). Now, looking at this row, the date is March 6, visitor is penguins, score is 2-4, home is blues, attendance is 9092, record is 21-30-11, and points are 53.\n\nSo the attendance for that game is indeed 9092. That matches exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is supported by this specific cell in the table.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere because each row represents a different date. So March 6th's attendance is only affected by its own row data.\n\nHence, based on the table provided, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe attendance for the Penguins vs. Blues game on March 6th is indeed 9092 as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the blue and penguin game on march 20 , score be 2 - 4",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the blue and penguin game on march 20 , score be 2 - 4\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions a game between the blues and the penguins on March 20th with a score of 2-4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific date. I need to find the row for March 20. Scanning through the dates: there's march 2, march 6, march 7, march 9, march 13, march 16, march 17, march 20... So that's row number 8 (if we start counting from 0 or 1? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the table provided, the first date is \"march 2\" which is the first row. Let's count:\n\n1. March 2\n2. March 6\n3. March 7\n4. March 9\n5. March 13\n6. March 16\n7. March 17\n8. March 20\n9. March 23\n10. March 24\n11. March 26\n12. March 27\n13. March 30\n14. March 31\n\nSo March 20 is the 8th row, which would be row index 7 if we're using zero-based indexing or row 8 if one-based. Wait, but in programming sometimes it's zero-based. The example given in the instructions used row_index as an integer without specifying whether it starts at 0 or 1. Looking back at the example:\n\nIn the example, they showed a JSON with \"row_index\": 0 and 1, which probably corresponds to the first two rows of a table that has more than two rows. So perhaps it's zero-based.\n\nSo March 20 is row index 7 (since 2nd row would be index 1? Wait no, let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: March 2\n- Row 1: March 6\n- Row 2: March 7\n- Row 3: March 9\n- Row 4: March 13\n- Row 5: March 16\n- Row 6: March 17\n- Row 7: March 20\nYes, so March 20 is row index 7.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the \"blue and penguin game\". Looking at the table columns, the 'visitor' column would be the team visiting, and the 'home' column would be the home team. So for a game between blues and penguins, which are one home and one visitor?\n\nLooking at row 7 (March 20), the date is march 20, visitor is blues, and home is penguins. Yes, that's correct because the claim says blue vs penguin.\n\nNow, checking the score. The 'score' column for March 20 shows \"2 - 4\". So in the table, it's written as \"2 - 4\", which matches the claim's score of 2-4. However, in the table, sometimes scores are written with a space before the hyphen, like \"6 - 6\" and \"2 - 4\". So \"2 - 4\" is indeed present.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim check out: date, teams, and score. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the row for March 20 and the 'score' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the king and penguin game on march 20 have score of 2 - 4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions a game between the Kings (I assume they mean the home team as 'kings') and the Penguins (away team). The date is March 20th.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for March 20. Scanning through the dates: march 2, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17, 20... there it is, row 8 (if we count starting from 0). So the relevant row is index 8.\n\nNext, I check the 'visitor' and 'home' columns for that date. March 20: visitor is blues, home is penguins. Wait, but the claim says \"king and penguin game.\" Hmm, maybe I misread the team names. Let me check the table again. In row 8, under 'home', it's penguins, and 'visitor' is blues. So the game was between penguins (home) and blues (visitor), not kings.\n\nThat means the claim might be incorrect because it mentions kings playing against penguins on March 20, but according to the table, the home team was penguins, and the visitor was blues.\n\nNow, checking the score for that row: under 'score', it's 2 - 4. So if the game was between penguins (home) vs. blues (visitor), then the claim is slightly off because it refers to kings instead of blues. However, the score matches. But since the teams are different from what the claim states, the overall claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check other relevant columns like 'score' but since the date and team names don't align, even if the score matched, the rest doesn't add up.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
