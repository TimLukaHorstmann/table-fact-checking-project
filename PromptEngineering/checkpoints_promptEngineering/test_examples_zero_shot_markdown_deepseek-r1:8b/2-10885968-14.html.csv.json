    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"north melbourne's away team score be 13.11 (89)\".\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where north melbourne is listed as an away team. Let me go row by row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Home team is Footscray, away is Hawthorn. Not relevant.\n2. **Second Row**: Home is Fitzroy, away is Geelong. No.\n3. **Third Row**: Home Essendon vs South Melbourne. No.\n4. **Fourth Row**: Home St Kilda vs North Melbourne. Ah, here we go. North Melbourne is the away team in this row.\n5. **Fifth Row**: Richmond vs Collingwood. Not relevant.\n6. **Sixth Row**: Carlton vs Melbourne. No.\n\nSo, the fourth row is where North Melbourne is an away team. Now, I need to check their score. The away team score for North Melbourne is listed as 13.11 (89). That's exactly what the claim states: 13.11 (89).\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. It matches exactly with the relevant cell in the fourth row under \"away team score\".\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if North Melbourne's away game has a score of 13.11 (89). The table shows this exact score in the fourth row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the score for the away team of north melbourne be 7.14 (56).\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table. There's a column called \"away team\" and another called \"away team score.\" I'm looking for the row where the away team is \"north melbourne.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Footscray vs Hawthorn: Away team is Hawthorn.\n2. Fitzroy vs Geelong: Away team is Geelong.\n3. Essendon vs South Melbourne: Away team is South Melbourne.\n4. St Kilda vs North Melbourne: Here's the away team we're interested in, North Melbourne.\n5. Richmond vs Collingwood: Away team is Collingwood.\n6. Carlton vs Melbourne: Away team is Melbourne.\n\nSo the relevant row is the 4th one (index starting from 0, so row_index 3).\n\nNext, I need to check the \"away team score\" column for this row. The away team here is North Melbourne with a score of 13.11 (89). Wait, that doesn't match the claim which says 7.14 (56).\n\nSo the score in the table doesn't support the claim. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells. Since the claim refers to two specific pieces of information: the away team name and their score, I need to include both columns for that row.\n\nThe row index is 3 (since it's the fourth row in a 0-indexed list), column names are \"away team\" and \"away team score.\"\n\nSo the relevant_cells should be a list with two objects: one pointing to row 3 and column \"away team,\" and another to row 3 and \"away team score.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
