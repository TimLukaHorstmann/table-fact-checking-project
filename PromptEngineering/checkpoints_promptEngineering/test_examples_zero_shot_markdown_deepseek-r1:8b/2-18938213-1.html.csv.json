    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"yuri kadenatsy (urs) win silver in 1982\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions a person named Yuri Kadenatsy from the USSR who won silver in the year 1982. So I need to check if this person exists in the table for that specific year and medal.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, place, gold, silver, bronze. Each row corresponds to a different year, place, and athletes in each medal category.\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant rows. The claim is about 1982, so I need to find the row where the year is 1982. Scanning through the table, I see that in 1982, the place was Caracas. Let me confirm: yes, row number 7 has the year 1982.\n\nNow, within this row, under the silver column, it says \"yuri kadenatsy (urs)\". That matches exactly with the claim. So, the silver medalist for 1982 in Caracas is Yuri Kadenatsy from the USSR.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. There's no discrepancy or missing information here. So, it should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Yuri Kadenatsy won silver in 1982. The relevant row and column are identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe answer is based on the direct match of Yuri Kadenatsy's name in the silver medal position for the year 1982.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"yuri kadenatsy ( urs ) win silver in 1983\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Yuri Kadenatsy in the table. Looking at each row, I see that in 1982, the silver medalist was Yuri Kadenatsy from the Soviet Union ( Urs ). The column for 1982 is silver. Then, moving to the next year, 1983, the bronze medalist was Yerzy Greszkiewicz from Poland. There's no mention of Yuri Kadenatsy in 1983, neither in gold, silver, nor bronze.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. In 1982, under place \"caracas,\" silver is Yuri Kadenatsy (Urs). Then in 1983, the place is Edmonton, and the bronze is Yerzy Greszkiewicz (Pol). The silver for 1983 is Nikolai Dedov (Urs), not Yuri. So Yuri isn't mentioned in 1983 at all.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Yuri Kadenatsy won silver in 1983 doesn't align with the table data provided. It seems false because he didn't medal in that year.\n\nI think I've covered all possibilities by checking each relevant row and column for 1983. No entries match Yuri Kadenatsy there.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yuri Kadenatsy won silver in 1983, but according to the table, in 1982 he won silver and in 1983 he wasn't listed at all. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
