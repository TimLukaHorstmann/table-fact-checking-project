    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"In the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final, Tisha Venturini played 4 matches at Gavle.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The main points are:\n- Event: Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final\n- Player: Tisha Venturini\n- Details: Played 4 matches at Gavle\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with multiple rows and columns. Each row represents a specific match, and the columns include details like date, location, lineup, result, etc.\n\nI'll start by finding the relevant row in the table where the event mentioned is \"Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.\" From the table, I see that the first four rows (rows 0 to 3) all have this exact name in the 'match' column. The other events like Atlanta 1996 and USA 1999 are different.\n\nSo, focusing on row 0: All the cells under \"Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final\" match the claim's event. Now, checking the player, Tisha Venturini. I don't see her name in any of the 'lineup' columns provided. The lineups are mentioned as things like \"start,\" and specific players with last names like Cromwell or Milbrett, but not Tisha Venturini.\n\nNext, checking if she played 4 matches at Gavle. In row 0, the location is Gavle, but there's only one match listed here (since row 0 corresponds to the final). However, looking further down, I see that rows 1, 2, and 3 are also in Gavle for group stage matches before the final. But these aren't part of the final itself.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the final. So the only match related to the final is row 0, where she might not have played because her name isn't in the lineup. The other matches at Gavle (rows 1-3) are group stages, which aren't the final. So even if she played there, it's not the final.\n\nPutting this together: There's no evidence Tisha Venturini was part of the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. The claim might be referring to other matches she played in Gavle, but those aren't the final. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tisha Venturini played four matches at Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. However, upon examining the table, there is no mention of her participating in any matches related to the final. The table shows other players and match details but does not include her as part of the lineup for the final or any related matches in Gavle. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"match\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in the highest scoring game 5 goal be score , which be on 1995 - 06 - 10\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a \"highest scoring game\" with a 5-0 score, occurring on June 10, 1995.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any matches where the result is 5-0 and the date is June 10, 1995.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table to check for these conditions. The table has multiple rows, each corresponding to a different match.\n\nStarting from row 1:\n- Date: 1995-06-06\n- Result: 3-3\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: 1995-06-08\n- Result: 2-0\n\nRow 3:\n- Date: 1995-06-10\n- Result: 4-1\n\nRow 4:\n- Date: 1995-06-13\n- Result: 4-0\n\nRow 5:\n- Date: 1995-06-15\n- Result: 0-1\n\nRow 6:\n- Date: 1995-06-17\n- Result: 2-0\n\nNone of these matches have a result of 5-0 or 0-5. The highest score in the group matches is 4-1, but that's not a 5-0.\n\nNext, looking at row 7:\n- Date: 1996-07-21\n- Result: 3-0\n\nRow 8:\n- Date: 1996-07-23\n- Result: 2-1\n\nRow 9:\n- Date: 1996-07-25\n- Result: 0-0\n\nRow 10:\n- Date: 1996-07-28\n- Result: 2-1 (AET)\n\nRow 11:\n- Date: 1996-08-01\n- Result: 2-1\n\nNone of these matches are on June 10, 1995, and none have a 5-0 result.\n\nMoving to the USA 1999 World Cup matches starting from row 12:\n- Date: 1999-06-27\n- Result: 3-0\n\nRow 13:\n- Date: 1999-07-10\n- Result: 0-0 (PSO 5-4)\n\nAgain, none of these have a 5-0 result on the specified date.\n\nNow, considering the claim mentions \"highest scoring game\" with a 5-0 score on June 10, 1995. From the table provided, there is no match that fits both criteria: a 5-0 score and being held on June 10, 1995.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the dates, the matches for Sweden 1995 World Cup are in early June, but none of them have a 5-0 result. The highest I see is 4-1 (row 3) and 4-0 (row 4), which are not 5-0.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Tisha Venturini's career is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"In Tisha Venturini's career, 3 match end in a draw, specifically on 1995-06-06, 1996-07-25, and 1999-07-10.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if there are three matches where the result was a draw (tie) for these specific dates.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list various matches from different competitions. Each row represents a match with details like date, location, lineup, result, and competition.\n\nMy task is to look through each row's \"result\" column and see if any of them are draws on the specified dates.\n\nThe claim mentions three specific dates: June 6, 1995; July 25, 1996; and July 10, 1999. I need to check if there were any matches with a result of 'draw' on these exact dates for Tisha Venturini's games.\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\n- The first set of rows (rows 1 to 3) are from the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final. However, these are group stage matches except row 4 is a quarter-final. None of these are likely to be Tisha Venturini's matches because she played for Sweden in 1995, but I'm not sure if she specifically played on June 6, 1995.\n\nWait, actually, the claim refers to \"Tisha Venturini,\" which I believe is an American player. Wait, no, perhaps it's a different name. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or confusion with another player. Wait, in the table, row 4 mentions 'cromwell' as the scorer, so that might be someone else.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table:\n\nRow 5: 1995-06-15 in Vasteras, result is 0-1 (loss). So, it's a loss for Sweden. But if Tisha Venturini was part of the US team, perhaps she wasn't involved in this match.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Tisha Venturini's career.\" I think Tisha Venturini is an American player who played in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup. Let me check the table:\n\nLooking at rows 12-13: 1999 matches. Row 13 has a result of 0-0 after PSO 5-4, which would be a draw. The date is July 10, 1999, so that matches one of the claim's dates.\n\nNow, checking for the other two dates:\n\n1995-06-06: Looking through the table, row 1 has this date, but it's a group stage match where Sweden played and the result was 3-3. Wait, but the claim is about Tisha Venturini having three drawn matches. However, if Tisha wasn't part of that match (since she's an American player), then perhaps this isn't relevant.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, row 1 is labeled as \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\" but looking at the details: it's a group stage match with result 3-3. So Sweden drew that game, but Tisha Venturini might not have been on the field for that match.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 is July 17, 1995, which is another group stage match, also a draw (2-0?), wait no: looking at the table, row 6 has date 1995-06-17? Wait, no, row 1 is June 6, row 6 might be a different competition.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize:\n\nThe table starts with \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\" as the first entry, then continues with more entries for that same competition. Then it switches to \"atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament,\" and so on.\n\nSo, rows 1-3 are from the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup group stage. Row 4 is the quarter-final on June 13, 1995, which ended in a 4-0 win for Sweden. Then row 5 is semifinal on June 15, 1995, with a loss.\n\nThen, rows 6 onwards are from different tournaments.\n\nWait, so in row 1: date June 6, 1995; location Gavle; result 3-3 (draw). So that's a group stage match of Sweden. If Tisha Venturini was part of the US team, she might have played against Sweden on that day.\n\nSimilarly, row 13 is July 10, 1999: result 0-0 after PSO 5-4, so it's a draw.\n\nBut the claim says three matches ended in a draw. So perhaps we need to find three matches where Tisha was involved and resulted in draws on those dates.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that row 13 is such a case: July 10, 1999, which is a draw.\n\nNow, what about June 6, 1995? Looking for any match involving Tisha Venturini. Wait, but how can we know from this table? The problem is the table doesn't mention players, only matches and their results.\n\nSo perhaps I need to rely on the dates and competitions. The claim mentions specific dates: 1995-06-06 (which was a draw in group stage for Sweden), 1996-07-25 (from Atlanta Olympics), and 1999-07-10 (World Cup).\n\nWait, let me check row 12: it's July 15, 1999; result not a draw.\n\nRow 13 is July 10, 1999; result 0-0, which is a draw. So that's one.\n\nLooking for other matches with the same dates as draws:\n\n1995-06-06: row1, result 3-3 (draw). But if Tisha was part of the US team playing against Sweden, then this would be a match she played in, resulting in a draw. That would count as another draw.\n\nThen, 1996-07-25: looking through the table for that date. Wait, row 7 has July 25, 1996; result is 2-1 (win). So not a draw.\n\nSo only two matches: June 6, 1995 and July 10, 1999 as draws. But the claim says three matches ended in draws on those specific dates.\n\nWait, that suggests I need to check if there's another match with the same date as a draw.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about three matches in total where her team had draws, regardless of the dates. But the way it's phrased: \"3 match end in a draw, specifically on 1995-06-06, 1996-07-25, and 1999-07-10.\"\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because those three specific dates each only have one match in the table. So if Tisha was involved in each of those matches, then she would have three draws.\n\nBut looking at row1: June 6, 1995; result 3-3 (draw). If she played that match, that's one draw.\n\nRow13: July10, 1999; result 0-0 (draw). That's two.\n\nBut is there a third match on the given dates? Row7: July25, 1996; result 2-1 (win). So no draw on that date. Therefore, only two matches where her team drew, not three.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding which competition was played on those dates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are only two draws on those specific dates in the table.\n\nBut wait, in row1: June6, 1995; result draw. That's one.\n\nRow13: July10, 1999; draw. That's two.\n\nNo third match on July25, 1996 that was a draw. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it states three matches, but only two are evident from the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting or missing something.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n- June6, 1995: draw.\n- July25, 1996: no draw in the given rows; row7 is July25, result win.\n- July10, 1999: draw.\n\nSo that's two draws. Therefore, the claim stating three matches is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more than one match on each date? Let me check:\n\nLooking for multiple matches on June6, 1995: only row1 has that date.\n\nJuly25, 1996: only row7.\n\nJuly10, 1999: only row13.\n\nSo each date corresponds to only one match. Therefore, if Tisha was involved in all three, she would have two draws (since July25 didn't result in a draw). So the claim is incorrect because it mentions three matches as draws on those dates, but there are only two actual draws.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering Tisha's career. Wait, Tisha Venturini did play for the US Women's National Team. Let me recall her history:\n\nShe was part of the US teams in 1995 and 1999 FIFA World Cups.\n\nIn 1995, she scored a goal against Sweden in the group stage match (which would be row1: June6, 1995; result 3-3). So that's one draw.\n\nIn 1999, she played in the semifinal against Brazil, which was a win for the US. Then she played in the final against Germany, which ended in a draw (July10, 1999; 0-0 after PSO). So that's another draw.\n\nAs for July25, 1996: that's the Atlanta Olympics. The US team defeated China in the semifinal (I think) and then won the final. So no draw on that date.\n\nTherefore, Tisha was involved in two draws on the specified dates, not three. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as it states three matches ended in draws on those specific dates.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made is incorrect because there are only two instances of draws by the US Women's National Team on the specified dates: June 6, 1995, and July 10, 1999. There is no draw on July 25, 1996. Therefore, the claim that three matches ended in a draw on those dates is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect as only two matches resulted in draws on the specified dates.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find which cells are relevant. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Tisha Venturini played a total of 13 matches in 3 different tournaments.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided to see if there's any information about Tisha Venturini. The table has columns like match, date, location, lineup, result, and competition. Each row seems to represent a specific match.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n- Row 0: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\" is mentioned in all cells except for some where it's just the number 1.\n- Rows 2 through 4 mention different matches but don't mention Tisha Venturini.\n\nRow 6 onwards are about the Atlanta 1996 tournament. Again, no mention of her name there either.\n\nThen, starting from row 7: \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\" is mentioned in all cells except for some numerical data. No Tisha here as well.\n\nContinuing down to rows 12 and 13: These are about the USA 1999 World Cup matches. None of these mention Tisha Venturini either.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing any entries that include \"Tisha Venturini\" in the table at all. So if none of the cells have her name or any identifier that she played in these matches, then perhaps the claim is false.\n\nBut maybe I need to check each row's competition column for tournaments where she might have participated. Let me see:\n\n- The competitions listed are:\n  - sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\n  - group match\n  - quarter - final\n  - semifinal\n  - third place match\n  - Atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament\n  - group stage\n  - gold medal match\n  - USA 1999 fifa women's world cup\n\nNone of these tournaments are associated with Tisha Venturini, as far as I can tell. So if she didn't participate in any of the matches listed here, then the claim that she played 13 matches across 3 tournaments is false.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another angle. Maybe the table doesn't list all her matches? But the problem states \"given in markdown format,\" implying it's comprehensive. Since there are no entries for her, the claim can't be supported by this data. Therefore, it's false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Tisha Venturini played 13 matches across 3 tournaments, we examine each row of the provided table. None of the rows contain \"Tisha Venturini\" or indicate her participation in any match within the listed competitions.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"1 out of the 13 matches be a gold medal match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table represents. It looks like it's a list of matches from different competitions, each with their own details like date, location, lineup, result, and competition type. Each row in the table seems to correspond to a specific match, numbered from 1 to 13.\n\nNow, the claim is about how many of these 13 matches are \"gold medal matches.\" So I need to find out if exactly one of the 13 listed matches is classified as a gold medal match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'competition' column. Let me check each competition type and see which ones result in a gold medal match.\n\n1. The first two rows (matches 1 and 2) are group stage matches for the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n2. Matches 3 is also a group stage match but in Helsingborg, Sweden.\n3. Match 4 is a quarter-final.\n4. Match 5 is a semifinal.\n5. Match 6 is a third place match.\n6. Then comes the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament matches (rows 7-11).\n   - Matches 7 and 8 are group stage.\n   - Match 9 is group stage in Miami.\n   - Match 10 is a semifinal in Athens, GA.\n   - Match 11 is the gold medal match.\n7. After that, it switches to the USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup starting from match 12.\n   - Matches 12 and 13 are group stage and final respectively.\n\nSo, looking for gold medal matches: In the Atlanta 1996 tournament, match 11 is explicitly labeled as a \"gold medal match.\" That seems to be the only one in the list. The USA 1999 World Cup doesn't have any gold medal matches because their match 13 is a final but not specified as a gold medal.\n\nNow, checking all 13 matches: Only match 11 (row 11) is a gold medal match. So out of 13, only one is a gold medal match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that exactly one of the 13 matches is a gold medal match.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It mentions three separate events:\n\n1. Sweden's 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.\n2. Atlanta's 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament.\n3. USA's 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nNow, I'll look at each part of the claim against the table to see if they are supported by the data.\n\nStarting with the first event: \"Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final\". Looking at the table, the first few rows (rows 0-3) all mention \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\" across multiple columns. Specifically, row 0 has all cells matching this event except for the \"match\" column where it's just numbered as 1. The date is June 6, 1995, location Gavle, lineup includes start, and result is a draw (3-3). This supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the second event: \"Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament\". Looking at row 4 to row 11, I see that starting from row 7 onwards, the events switch to \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\". For example, row 7 mentions Atlanta with a group stage match on July 21, 1996. So, there's support for this event in the table.\n\nLastly, the third event: \"USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup\". Scrolling down to rows 12 and 13, I see that row 12 is about USA's 1999 World Cup group stage on June 27, 1999, and row 13 details a final match in Los Angeles with a penalty shoot-out. This also supports the third part of the claim.\n\nSince all three parts of the claim are supported by corresponding rows in the table, the claim appears to be TRUE. I need to identify which cells are relevant. For each event, the matching row has all columns filled with details about that specific match. Therefore, the relevant cells would be the entire row for each event: row 0, row 7-11 (wait, no, row 7 is part of Atlanta's tournament), and row 12-13.\n\nWait, actually, row 0 is the first match, which is Sweden's final. Then, the next set starts at row 4, but that's a different event (quarter-final). The Atlanta event starts at row 7. So rows 0, 7-11, and 12-13 are relevant because they cover the three events mentioned in the claim.\n\nI need to structure this into JSON as per instructions. Each relevant cell should have \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". Since all columns for these rows are relevant, each row's every column is relevant. However, the example given only lists the columns by name without specifying each cell. So perhaps I should list all cells across these rows under their respective column names.\n\nBut the user's example shows that for multiple cells in a row, they can be listed as separate entries. For instance, if a row has 5 relevant columns, you'd have five entries in \"relevant_cells\". In this case, since each of the three events covers all columns (match, date, location, lineup, result, competition), and each of these rows has six columns, but the first column is just a number. But for the purpose of relevance, perhaps all cells are relevant because they provide details about each event.\n\nWait, the user might not need to list every single cell, but only indicate that for each relevant row, all columns (or specific ones) are checked. However, the example provided by the user in their instructions lists specific column names as relevant. So I think it's better to include each cell across these rows for each relevant column.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, each of the three events is fully represented in a single row, so all columns for those rows are relevant. Therefore, for each event, we can take one row (the one that represents that specific match) and list all columns as relevant.\n\nAlternatively, since each of these events spans multiple rows in the table, but the claim refers to each event individually, perhaps only one cell per event is needed, such as the first cell where the event is mentioned. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, looking back at the example provided by the user: they had a similar structure and included two cells from different rows for different columns. So maybe here, for each of the three events in the claim, we need to find the corresponding row and include all columns as relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For Sweden 1995: row 0, with all columns (but in the table, row 0 has six columns, but only five are data; perhaps match is just a number). So maybe for each event's row, all non-header columns are relevant.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each of these rows corresponds to the specific match mentioned in the claim, each cell in those rows is part of that specific event. Therefore, to fully support the claim, all cells in each of these rows need to be considered.\n\nSo:\n\n- Row 0: columns date, location, lineup, result, competition (match is just a number, so perhaps it's not needed as 'match' is about the event itself)\n- Rows 7-11: Atlanta's tournament details\n- Rows 12-13: USA's World Cup details\n\nSo, to capture all relevant cells for each event:\n\n1. For Sweden 1995: row 0, columns date (row[0].date), location (row[0].location), lineup (row[0].lineup), result (row[0].result), competition (row[0].competition)\n2. For Atlanta 1996: rows 7-11, all columns\n3. For USA 1999: rows 12 and 13, all columns\n\nBut since the user's example lists only column names without row indices, perhaps we can map it as:\n\nEach event is represented by a row in the table where their name appears in the \"match\" column (except for row 0 which starts with number 1). So for each of these events, the entire row is relevant. Therefore, all columns in those rows should be considered.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that each event is fully covered by a single row, then for each event, one row and its six columns are relevant.\n\nBut since in the table, each match is listed as a separate row with multiple data points, perhaps each cell within these rows needs to be checked. Therefore, I'll list all cells across the three events' corresponding rows as relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is supported by the table entries for each event mentioned. So the answer is that the claim is TRUE, and the relevant_cells include all columns from the specific rows corresponding to each event.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in the provided table, confirming the existence of the three events as described. Therefore, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"claim\": {\n    \"truth_value\": \"True\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Each part of the claim corresponds to specific rows in the table, providing details about each event.\",\n    \"supporting_evidence\": [\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 0,\n        \"columns\": [\"date\", \"location\", \"lineup\", \"result\", \"competition\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_start\": 7,\n        \"row_end\": 11,\n        \"columns\": [\"match\", \"date\", \"location\", \"lineup\", \"result\", \"competition\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 12,\n        \"columns\": [\"match\", \"date\", \"location\", \"lineup\", \"result\", \"competition\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 13,\n        \"columns\": [\"match\", \"date\", \"location\", \"lineup\", \"result\", \"competition\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim is: \"1996 - 08 - 01 athens , ga start 2 - 1 gold medal match\"\n\nLooking at this, it seems like the claim is talking about a specific event that happened on August 1, 1996, in Athens, GA. The key elements are the date (1996-08-01), location (Athens, GA), the starting score of 2-1, and that it's a gold medal match.\n\nNow, I need to check if this information is present in the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. The table has several columns: match, date, location, lineup, result, and competition. Each row represents a different match with its details.\n\nI should go through each row and see if any match the claim's criteria.\n\nStarting from row 1, I can see that all the entries are about Sweden in 1995. So, no match here relates to 1996 or Athens, GA. Moving on to row 2, same thing\u2014still 1995 matches in Gavle and Helsingborg. Rows 3-6 are also from 1995.\n\nRow 7 is about Atlanta 1996. The date here is July 21, so that's before August 1st. The location is Orlando, not Athens. So row 7 doesn't match the claim. Row 8 is July 23 in Miami, still not matching. Row 9 is July 25 in Miami as well.\n\nThen comes row 10: date is July 28 in Athens, GA. But it's a semifinal with a score of 2-1 AET (which I assume stands for after extra time). Not the same as August 1, so not matching yet.\n\nRow 11 has the date August 1, 1996. Location is Athens, GA. Lineup is start, which matches. The result is 2-1, and competition is gold medal match. So this row seems to exactly match all parts of the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: in row 11, the match number is 11. Date is 1996-08-01, location Athens, GA. Lineup is start, result is 2-1, competition is gold medal match. Yes, that's exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the row where all these details align. From the table, that's row 11. The columns involved are date, location, lineup, result, and competition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
