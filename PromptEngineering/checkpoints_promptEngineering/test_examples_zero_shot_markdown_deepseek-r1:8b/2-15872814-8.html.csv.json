The claim says: \"In Atlanta with a score of w109 - 101 (ot), Rafter Alston have 8 high assist.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be verified.\n\n1. **Location**: The game was in Atlanta.\n2. **Score**: The result was a win for Atlanta with a score of 109-101 in overtime (OT).\n3. **Player**: It mentions Rafter Alston having 8 high assists.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. So I need to find the game where all these conditions are met: location is Atlanta, score is w109 - 101 (ot), and Rafter Alston has 8 assists.\n\nI'll start by checking each row for the location \"Atlanta\". Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 75: April 8 vs Atlanta\n- The rest of the rows don't have Atlanta as the opponent except for row 75.\n\nNow, looking at row 75:\n- Game number: 75\n- Date: April 8\n- Opponent: Atlanta\n- Score: w109 - 101 (ot)\n- High points: Jalen Rose with 30\n- High rebounds: Morris Peterson with 14\n- High assists: Rafter Alston with 8\n\nSo in this row, the score matches, it's Atlanta as the opponent, and Rafter Alston indeed has 8 high assists.\n\nTherefore, all conditions are met. The claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 75, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"w 109 - 101 (ot) be the score on april 8\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions a game where the score was a win for the team with 109 points against 101, and it happened on April 8th. So my task is to find if such a game exists in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several columns like game number, date, team, score, etc. I need to focus on the 'game' number, 'date', and 'score' columns because those are directly related to the claim.\n\nThe claim specifies \"april 8\", so I should look for rows where the 'date' column is April 8. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 72: April 1\n- Row 73: April 3\n- Row 74: April 6\n- Row 75: April 8\n\nAh, here's Row 75 with the date April 8. Now, let's check the score for that game. The 'score' column shows \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\", which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the row index of this game and the 'date' column to confirm the specific date. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 75, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"April 18 have the score higher than w 109 - 101 (ot)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see if there's any game that happened on April 18. The table has games numbered from 72 up to 82. I'll go through each row and check the date column for April 18.\n\nLooking at row 72: Date is April 1. Row 73: April 3. Row 74: April 6. Row 75: April 8. Row 76: April 9. Row 77: April 11. Row 78: April 12. Row 79: April 15. Row 80: April 17. Row 81: April 19. Row 82: April 20.\n\nWait, I don't see any game on April 18 in this table. The closest games around that date are on the 17th and the 19th. So maybe the claim is referring to a non-existent game or perhaps there's a typo in the date?\n\nNext, let's consider what the score would look like if such a game existed. The claim says the score was higher than \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\". So the home team won with a score of 109-101 in overtime.\n\nLooking at similar games in the table, for example, row 75: Charlotte vs Detroit on April 8, which is a win with a score of 109-101. The high points were Jalen Rose with 30, and other stats like rebounds and assists are listed.\n\nIf there's no game on April 18, then the claim might be false because such a game doesn't exist in the table. Alternatively, if there was a game on April 18, but it's not listed here, which is possible since maybe not all games are included, but without that information, I can only go by what's provided.\n\nAlso, considering the dates given, the last game in the table is April 20, so perhaps April 18 isn't covered. Therefore, any score for April 18 isn't present, making the claim invalid because there's no evidence of such a game with that score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game on April 18 with a higher score than \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\". However, after checking all the games in the table, none are listed for April 18. The closest relevant game is on April 8 with the same score. Without evidence of such a game on April 18, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 75, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
