    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary marry william ii before she be 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for Princess Mary in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column: row 1 is Mary, Princess Royal from 1631-1660. That's our target princess Mary. \n\nNow, the claim says she married William II before turning 12. So I need to check her marriage date. Looking at the 'date married' column, for row 1 it's 1641. She was born in 1631, so let me calculate her age when she married. 1641 minus 1631 is 10 years old. Wait, that's confusing because 1631-1641 would be a span of 10 years, but if she was born in 1631 and married in 1641, that makes her 10 years old. But the claim says before turning 12, so at 10, that's before 12. So she did marry before she turned 12.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Let me double-check. If someone is born in 1631 and married in 1641, they would be 10 years old in 1641. But when you say \"before turning 12,\" does that mean before reaching the age of 12? So if she's 10, she hasn't turned 12 yet, so yes, she married before 12.\n\nBut wait, let me check the table again. The 'date married' for row 1 is 1641. So her age would be 10 at that time. Therefore, she was 10 when she married William II, which is indeed before turning 12. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I also need to look at other relevant cells. The claim mentions William II as her husband, so I should check if that's correct. In row 1, under 'husband dates', it's William II, Prince of Orange from 1626-1650. So yes, that's the correct husband.\n\nSo the relevant cells are: row 1 for princess Mary's marriage date and husband details. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Princess Mary married William II before she turned 12, as evidenced by her marriage in 1641 when she was 10 years old. The relevant cells provide confirmation of these details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Princess Louise do not married until she be around 38 year old.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the relevant information about Princess Louise. Let's see, the table has several rows with different princesses and their details.\n\nLooking at row 5, it says:\n- Name: louise, princess royal 1867 - 1931\n- Parent: edward vii 1841 - 1910\n- Date married: 1889\n- Husband dates: alexander duff, 1st duke of fife 1849 - 1912\n\nWait, so her date of marriage is listed as 1889. Her birth year would be 1867 (since she's princess royal from 1867 to 1931). So in 1889, she was 22 years old because 1889 minus 1867 is 22. That doesn't align with the claim that she didn't marry until around 38.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are multiple entries for Princess Louise or if I'm looking at the correct row. Let me go through each row again:\n\nRow 1: Mary\nRow 2: Anne\nRow 3: Charlotte\nRow 4: Victoria\nRow 5: louise\nRow 6: Mary\nRow 7: Anne\n\nSo row 5 is indeed about Princess Louise. Her date of marriage is 1889, and her birth year is 1867. So at 22 years old, she married. The claim says she didn't marry until around 38, which is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should also check if there's any other information that might affect this conclusion, but from what I see in the table, her marriage date is clearly stated as 1889. There's no indication of her marrying later or any discrepancies in the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Princess Louise marrying at around 38 years old is false because she married at 22.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date married\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"name dates\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth the ii have have 2 husband\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim and break it down. The user mentions Princess Anne, referring to a member of Elizabeth II's family. But wait, there are multiple princesses named Anne in the British royal family, so I need to clarify which one they're talking about. However, looking at the table provided, it lists several princesses with names like Mary, Anne, Charlotte, Victoria, Louise, Mary again, and Anne (twice). \n\nWait, but the table might have some duplicates or different entries for the same person, so I need to check that as well. The claim is specifically about Princess Anne having two husbands. So I should look through the table to find rows where the name is \"Anne\" and see how many husbands they had.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2: Name is \"Anne, princess royal 1709 - 1759\". Her parent is George II, she married in 1734, and her husband's dates are William IV, prince of orange from 1711-1751. So that's one husband.\n\nThen there's Row 7, which has two entries for Anne. The first entry (Row 7) says she was born in 1950 and her parent is Elizabeth II from 1926 to present. She married Mark Phillips in 1973-1992. Then another entry for Anne, same name, but different husband: Sir Timothy Laurence, married in 1992.\n\nWait, so Row 7 has two entries for the same person? That seems odd. So perhaps it's a mistake in the table, or maybe it's meant to represent her marriages.\n\nBut looking at the column \"husband dates\", for the first Anne entry (Row 7), the husband is Mark Phillips from 1948-present, but her marriage date is listed as 1973-1992. Then another row with same name Anne, parent Elizabeth II, husband Sir Timothy Laurence from 1955-present, and marriage date 1992.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because a person can't have two different husbands at the same time. So perhaps the table has duplicated entries for Princess Anne, which is confusing.\n\nBut according to the claim, Princess Anne (as in Elizabeth II's family) had two husbands. From the table:\n\nRow 7: She married Mark Phillips and then Sir Timothy Laurence. But wait, the first entry says she was married from 1973-1992, and the second entry shows her husband as Sir Timothy with a marriage date of 1992.\n\nWait, that would mean she had two marriages, but looking at the dates:\n\nFirst, in Row 7: She married Mark Phillips, and then in another row (also Anne), she married Sir Timothy Laurence. But actually, in the table, each row is a separate entry, so perhaps it's trying to show both of her husbands.\n\nWait, no, looking again: The table has two entries for \"Anne\", same name but different columns filled? Let me check:\n\nLooking at Row 7 and another row with the same order number (7) might be an error. Wait, the table shows:\n\nRow 7: anne , princess royal 1950 -           | 1987 - present                         | elizabeth ii 1926 -    | 1973 - 1992    | mark phillips 1948 -                               |\nThen another entry:\n\n|       7 | anne , princess royal 1950 -           | 1987 - present                         | elizabeth ii 1926 -    | 1992           | sir timothy laurence 1955 -                        |\n\nSo, the same row number (7) has two entries. That's probably a mistake because each row should represent one person. So perhaps the table is misaligned or there's an error in how it's structured.\n\nAssuming that Row 7 has two marriages, but looking at the data:\n\nFirst entry: married Mark Phillips from 1973-1992.\n\nSecond entry: married Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992.\n\nWait, so she was married to Mark from 1973 until 1992, and then remarried to Timothy in 1992. So technically, that's two marriages, making it two husbands.\n\nBut the claim says \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II have have 2 husband.\" It might be referring to Princess Anne being Elizabeth II's daughter or granddaughter? Wait, no: Elizabeth II was Queen, and her daughters included Queen Elizabeth (the current one) herself, but perhaps the user is referring to Princess Anne, who is Elizabeth II's daughter.\n\nWait, but in reality, Princess Anne married twice. She first married Mark Phillips in 1973, and then in 1992, she married Sir Timothy Laurence after divorcing Mark. So yes, she has two husbands.\n\nBut looking at the table: The row for Anne (Row 7) lists her marriage to Mark as 1973-1992, and another entry with same name and parent but husband Sir Timothy with a marriage date of 1992. So that would indicate two marriages, thus two husbands.\n\nTherefore, based on this, the claim should be TRUE because Princess Anne has had two husbands.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the table correctly reflects this. Because in the table, each row is supposed to represent one person, so having two entries for Anne with different husbands might indicate that she has two marriages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the duplication is an error, and only one of them should be considered.\n\nBut in reality, Princess Anne has indeed had two husbands, so regardless of how the table is structured, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The claim says \"Princess anne of elizabeth the ii have have 2 husband.\" So it's referring to a specific princess named Anne, likely Elizabeth II's daughter. According to real history, Princess Anne, who is the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and the late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, has indeed been married twice: first to Mark Phillips in 1973, and then to Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because she has two husbands.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II has had two husbands is TRUE. Based on historical records and the analysis of the table provided, Princess Anne has indeed been married twice, first to Mark Phillips and later to Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is TRUE.",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that Princess Anne of Elizabeth is the sole princess in the list who has gotten a divorce. So I need to check if any other princesses have also undergone a divorce as per the information provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: order, name, dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates. Each row represents a different princess with their respective details.\n\nI need to identify which rows are relevant for checking the claim. The key aspects here are whether each princess has a divorce mentioned in any of the columns provided.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1: Mary, Princess Royal (1631-1660)** \n   - Parent: Charles I (1600-1649)\n   - Date Married: 1641\n   - Husband: William II, Prince of Orange (1626-1650)\n   - No mention of divorce here.\n\n2. **Row 2: Anne, Princess Royal (1709-1759)**\n   - Parent: George II (1683-1760)\n   - Date Married: 1734\n   - Husband: William IV, Prince of Orange (1711-1751)\n   - No mention of divorce.\n\n3. **Row 3: Charlotte, Princess Royal (1766-1828)**\n   - Parent: George III (1738-1820)\n   - Date Married: 1797\n   - Husband: King Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg (1754-1816)\n   - No mention of divorce.\n\n4. **Row 4: Victoria, Princess Royal (1840-1901)**\n   - Parent: Victoria (1819-1901)\n   - Date Married: 1858\n   - Husband: Frederick III, German Emperor (1831-1888)\n   - No mention of divorce.\n\n5. **Row 5: Louise, Princess Royal (1867-1931)**\n   - Parent: Edward VII (1841-1910)\n   - Date Married: 1889\n   - Husband: Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife (1849-1912)\n   - No mention of divorce.\n\n6. **Row 6: Mary, Princess Royal (1897-1965)**\n   - Parent: George V (1865-1936)\n   - Date Married: 1922\n   - Husband: Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood (1882-1947)\n   - No mention of divorce.\n\n7. **Row 7: Anne, Princess Royal (1950-present)**\n   - Parent: Elizabeth II (1926-present)\n   - Date Married: There are two entries here, which is confusing. The first entry says \"1973-1992\" and the second says \"1992\". So she married twice. However, I need to check if there's any indication of a divorce.\n   - Looking at her husbands' dates: Mark Phillips (1948-) and Sir Timothy Laurence (1955-). There's no mention of a divorce in either case.\n\nNow, the claim is about Princess Anne being the only one who got a divorce. From what I can see, none of the other princesses have any information indicating they've been divorced. Each row doesn't show any entry related to divorce, such as remarriage after a divorce or any indication that their marriages ended in that way.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, it appears that Princess Anne is indeed unique in not having her marriage annulled or dissolved, and there's no record of her having a divorce. However, I should double-check if there are any hidden columns or information that might affect this conclusion, but according to the given data, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"parent\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}]}",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions a \"prince mary of charles i.\" Looking at the table, it lists various princess royals with their details. I need to see if any of them are named Mary and were associated with Charles I.\n\nLooking at row 1: The name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660.\" The parent is listed as \"charles i 1600 - 1649.\" So this seems to be Princess Mary, daughter of Charles I. Her dates are from 1631 to 1660, which means she was alive during the time of Charles I.\n\nNext, I need to check if she died before turning 40. Let's calculate her age at death. She was born in 1631 and died in 1660. So that's a lifespan of 29 years. Since 29 is less than 40, she indeed died before reaching the age of 40.\n\nNow, looking at other rows to ensure there are no other Princess Mary associated with Charles I. The other entries for \"mary\" are in row 6 and row 7, but those are under different reigns (George V and Elizabeth II) and don't mention Charles I as their parent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the information in row 1 of the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"parent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Her parent is Charles I (1600-1649), and she married William II. The date of marriage listed is 1641.\n- Since Princess Mary was born in 1631, her 12th birthday would be around 1643.

So, I should focus on rows where the name is \"Princess Louise\" and check her marriage details.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 5: The name is \"louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931\". That seems to match Princess Louise. Let's see her date married. According to the table, it's 1889. So she was born in 1867 (assuming that's the birth year). If she married at 22, that's before turning 20? Wait, wait, no: 1889 minus 1867 is 22 years old, which is over 20. So she was 22 when she married.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"before the age of 20,\" meaning before reaching 20, so at 19 or younger. But she married at 22, so that would make the claim false. \n\nBut wait, maybe I need to double-check her birth year. The name dates are in the format like \"1867 - 1931.\" Typically, the first year is birth and the last is death. So if born in 1867, she was indeed 22 when married.\n\nSo the relevant row is row 5.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: order, name with dates, princess royal from and to dates, parent information, date married, and husband's details. Each row corresponds to a different princess.\n\nThe claim is about Princess Anne, specifically mentioning her being part of Elizabeth the II. So I need to find the relevant rows for both Princess Anne and Queen Elizabeth II in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- There are two entries for \"Anne, princess royal\":\n  - Row 2: Anne, princess royal from 1709 to 1759.\n  - Row 7: Anne, princess royal from 1950 onwards.\n\nWait, but row 7 is under a different numbering? Let me check. The order column goes up to row 7, but in the table, the last two rows seem to have the same name \"Anne, princess royal\" with slightly different data. Maybe that's a mistake or maybe it's two separate Annes.\n\nThe claim mentions \"princess anne of elizabeth the ii,\" so I think it refers to Anne who is part of Elizabeth II's family. Looking at row 7, which shows \"Anne, princess royal from 1950 - ...\", this seems more relevant because she would be part of a later generation.\n\nIn row 7, the parent is listed as \"elizabeth ii 1926 -\" with a range that includes up to her death in 2022. The date married is given as between 1973 and 1992, but I need to check if there's only one husband mentioned.\n\nLooking at the 'husband dates' column for row 7: it says \"mark phillips 1948 -\" without a closing date. Also, in another part of the table, under the same name Anne (maybe it's a typo), the husband is listed as \"sir timothy laurence 1955 -\".\n\nWait, that can't be right because each row should correspond to one person. So perhaps there are two rows for Anne. Let me check again.\n\nIn row 2: Anne, princess royal from 1709-1759, married in 1734 to William IV, prince of orange (1711-1751). That's one husband.\n\nIn row 7: Anne, princess royal from 1950 onwards, married between 1973 and 1992. Her husbands are Mark Phillips and Sir Timothy Laurence.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a duplication or a mistake in the table.\n\nWait, no, looking at the markdown:\n\nThe table has rows from 1 to 7. The last two rows (6 and 7) are:\n\n6 | mary , princess royal... |\n7 | anne , princess royal... |\n7 | anne , princess royal... |\n\nWait, that's odd.

Her husbands are Mark Phillips (1948-) and Sir Timothy Laurence (1955-). So she has two husbands.\n\nTherefore, according to this table, Princess Anne has two husbands, which would make the claim false because it states she only has one husband.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Princess Anne of Elizabeth being one of three princesses on the list who have a divorce is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in markdown format. The table has several columns: order, name, dates (which probably refer to her reign or when she was a princess royal), princess royal from and to dates, parent, date married, and husband's dates.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Princess Anne of Elizabeth being one of three princesses who have had a divorce. I need to check if this information is present in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Mary, Princess Royal from 1631-1660. She was married in 1641 to Charles II, but looking at the \"husband dates,\" they are William II, Prince of Orange from 1626-1650. I don't see a mention of a divorce here.\n\nRow 2: Anne, Princess Royal from 1709-1759, married in 1734 to William IV, Prince of Orange (1711-1751). No indication of a divorce.\n\nRow 3: Charlotte, Princess Royal from 1766-1828, married in 1797 to King Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg (1754-1816). No mention of a divorce here either.\n\nRow 4: Victoria, Princess Royal from 1840-1901, married in 1858 to Frederick III, German Emperor (1831-1888). No sign of a divorce.\n\nRow 5: Louise, Princess Royal from 1867-1931, married in 1889 to Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife (1849-1912). Not seeing any info about divorce here.\n\nRow 6: Mary, Princess Royal from 1897-1965, married in 1922 to Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood (1882-1947). No indication of a divorce.\n\nNow, Row 7 is interesting. It shows Anne, Princess Royal from 1950-present. She was married twice: first in 1973 to Mark Phillips, and then in 1992 to Sir Timothy Laurence. The claim mentions her being one of three princesses who have had a divorce. Now, looking at the 'date married' column, it says 1992 for Anne. Since she remarried after her first marriage ended in divorce, that would mean she has had a divorce.\n\nWait, but the table's 'parent' column for Row 7 is Elizabeth II (1926-). That might be confusing because Princess Anne is the daughter of Elizabeth II, so perhaps there was a mix-up. But focusing on the claim: if Anne had a divorce, that would make her one of three princesses listed who have divorced.\n\nBut looking at the table, only Row 7 mentions Anne and shows her married twice with a date in 1992. So she did get a divorce from Mark Phillips before remarrying. However, I need to confirm if the claim says \"divorce\" or remarriage. If it's about having a divorce, then yes, because she had her first marriage end in divorce.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't explicitly state that there was a divorce. It only shows two marriages for Anne. So maybe the table implies the divorce by showing a change in husband? Or is there another way to infer it?\n\nLooking back at the claim: \"princess anne of elizabeth be 1 of 3 princess on the list who have a divorce.\" So, does the table indicate that she had a divorce? The only info is her two marriages, which would imply a divorce from her first husband.\n\nBut in the table, it's possible that a divorce was involved if she remarried. However, I'm not sure if the table explicitly mentions the divorce or just the marriages. If the claim is based on her having had a divorce, then perhaps yes, but maybe the table doesn't directly state it.\n\nWait, looking at Row 7 again: The parent is Elizabeth II, and the 'date married' is listed as 1992. It's possible that she divorced Mark Phillips in 1978 (I recall that) before remarrying in 1992. So yes, she had a divorce. But does the table show this? The 'husband dates' for Row 7 only list Mark Phillips from 1948-present, but since Anne remarried later, perhaps the table doesn't explicitly state the divorce.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look at the columns again. The columns are name, princess royal dates, parent, date married, and husband dates. There's no 'divorce' column or event. So unless it's implied by multiple marriages, which would indicate a divorce.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is that Princess Anne had a divorce, then yes, she did, as her first marriage ended in divorce before her second. But does the table show this? It only shows two marriages with their respective dates, but doesn't explicitly state the divorce. So maybe the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says she is one of three princesses who have a divorce. Looking at all rows:\n\n- Mary: No mention of divorce.\n- Anne (Row 2): No.\n- Charlotte: No.\n- Victoria: No.\n- Louise: No.\n- Mary (Row 6): No.\n- Anne (Row7): Yes, she had a divorce.\n\nSo only Anne in Row7 has a divorce. The claim says \"1 of 3,\" so maybe the table includes two others who have divorces but it's not visible here. Wait, looking at the table again, perhaps I missed other princesses with multiple marriages indicating a divorce.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\nRow1: Mary was married once.\nRow2: Anne married once.\nRow3: Charlotte married once.\nRow4: Victoria married once.\nRow5: Louise married once.\nRow6: Mary married once.\nRow7: Anne married twice, implying a divorce.\n\nSo only Row7's Anne has a divorce. Therefore, the claim says she is one of three, but according to the table, only she has a divorce. So the claim isn't supported by the table as there are not three princesses with divorces. Unless the parent's info indicates something else.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The parent for Row7 is Elizabeth II, which might be a clue because Elizabeth II had issues with her children, but that doesn't necessarily mean Anne had a divorce.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. The table only shows two marriages for Anne, implying a divorce, but it's not explicitly stated. So maybe the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'divorce' is inferred from multiple marriages. But in terms of the data given, it's about marriage dates, not about whether the previous marriage ended with a divorce.\n\nSo, to sum up: The claim says that Princess Anne is one of three princesses who have had a divorce. According to the table, only Anne has a second marriage, implying she had a divorce from her first husband. There are no other princesses in the table with multiple marriages indicating a divorce. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because it's not clear that the others have had a divorce.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again: If 'divorce' is considered only once, then Anne is one of three. But in the table, only she has two marriages, implying a divorce. The other princesses have only one marriage each. So perhaps only Anne is shown as having had a divorce, making the claim incorrect because it says \"1 of 3.\" Unless there's more data elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, based on the given table, only Princess Anne from Row7 has a divorce, and no others do. So the claim that she is one of three princesses who have had a divorce isn't accurate as per the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether the claim that Princess Anne is one of three princesses with a divorce is supported by the given table. \n\n1. **Understanding the Table**: The table lists seven princesses with their respective details, including their marriages and parents. Notably, Princess Anne (Row 7) has two marriage entries, implying she remarried after a divorce.\n\n2. **Analyzing Divorces**: \n   - Princess Anne's second marriage in 1992 suggests that her first marriage ended in divorce.\n   - The other princesses have only one marriage each, indicating no known divorces.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Claim**: The claim states she is one of three princesses with a divorce. However, based on the table, only Princess Anne has evidence of a divorce. Others do not show multiple marriages or any indication of divorce.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim isn't fully supported by the table as it only shows Princess Anne having a divorce, not three. \n\n**Final Answer**: The claim is not supported by the provided data, so the answer is \\boxed{No}.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates. There are seven rows, each representing a different princess with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"princess mary of charles i.\" I need to find if there's such a princess in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Mary, Princess Royal 1631-1660. Her parent is Charles I (1600-1649), and she married William II in 1641. She was alive until 1660.\n2. Rows 2-7: Other princesses like Anne, Charlotte, Victoria, Louise, Mary, and Anne again, but none of them are named Mary linked to Charles I.\n\nSo, the first thing is that there's only one Mary listed, in row 1. Now, the claim says she died before turning 25. Let's check her lifespan.\n\nMary was born in 1631 (assuming from the \"name dates\" 1631-1660). She married in 1641 at 10 years old. Her husband, William II, became king after Charles I. She had issue and died in 1660. So, from her birth in 1631 to death in 1660, she lived until about 29 years old (1660-1631=29). Therefore, she did not die before turning 25.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact dates. If she was born in 1631 and died in 1660, that's 29 years old when she died. So, she turned 25 in her mid-20s (around 24 or 25), so she lived past 25. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because she didn't die before turning 25.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure there's no other Mary in the table linked to Charles I. The second row has another Mary (row 6: Mary, Princess Royal 1897-1965), but her parent is George V, not Charles I. So, only row 1's Mary is relevant here.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because she did die after turning 25.\n</think>\n\nThe princess in question is Mary, who lived from 1631 to 1660, dying at 29 years old. Therefore, she did not die before turning 25, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
