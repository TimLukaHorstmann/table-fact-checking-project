    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Neil Labute be nominate for best play in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns like year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents a different award or nomination for that year. So in 2009, there are several awards: Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards, among others.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Neil Labute being nominated for best play in 2009. I'll need to check the table entries for 2009 and see if Neil Labute is listed as a nominee in the category of best play.\n\nLooking at the rows one by one:\n\n1. The first row is for the Tony Award, Best Play, with the nominee being Neil Labute, and the result is \"nominated.\" That seems to directly support the claim.\n2. There's another Tony Award entry for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play, but that's for Thomas Sadoski, so not relevant here.\n3. Similarly, other entries like Marin Ireland are for different categories, so they don't apply.\n4. The Drama Desk Awards have an outstanding play category, but the nominee is \"outstanding play,\" which isn't a person, so it doesn't refer to Neil Labute.\n5. There's another Drama Desk Award for outstanding actor in a play and outstanding director of a play, both with different nominees, not relevant here.\n6. Finally, the Theatre World Award entry is for Marin Ireland, which again doesn't relate.\n\nSo, focusing on the first row, where year is 2009, award ceremony is Tony Award, category is best play, nominee is Neil Labute, and result is nominated. This matches exactly with the claim.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other entries that might be relevant. For instance, could \"best play\" refer to a work rather than a person? But in this case, the nominee is Neil Labute, which suggests it's about the individual, not just the play itself. So that entry definitely pertains to Neil Labute being nominated for best play.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim should be TRUE because there is an entry in the table where Neil Labute is nominated for best play in 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a specific row in the table where Neil Labute is listed as a nominee for Best Play during the 2009 Tony Awards.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"thomas sadoski be nominate for best performance by a lead actor in a play in 2009.\" \n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents an entry from 2009.\n\nFirst, I'll check each row to see if Thomas Sadoski is involved in any category related to best performance by a lead actor in a play. \n\nStarting from the first row: The year is 2009, award ceremony is Tony Award, category is best play, nominee is Neil Labute. Result is nominated. Not relevant.\n\nSecond row: Award is Tony, category is best performance by leading actor. Nominee is Thomas Sadoski. His result is nominated. This seems directly related to the claim.\n\nThird row: Award is Tony, category is best performance by featured actress. Nominee is Marin Ireland. Not relevant for Thomas.\n\nFourth row: Drama Desk award, outstanding play. Nominee is outstanding play. Not about a person, so irrelevant.\n\nFifth row: Drama Desk, outstanding actor in a play. Nominee is Thomas Sadoski. So he's again nominated here.\n\nSixth row: Drama Desk, outstanding director. Nominee is Terry Kinney. Not relevant.\n\nSeventh row: Theatre World award. Nominee is Marin Ireland. Not relevant.\n\nSo from the table, Thomas Sadoski was nominated for best performance by a leading actor in two different categories. Wait, but the claim specifically mentions \"best performance by a lead actor in a play.\"\n\nLooking at the second row, his category is \"best performance by a leading actor in a play,\" which matches exactly. His result is \"nominated.\" So he was indeed nominated for that specific award.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's a relevant row where Thomas Sadoski was nominated for best performance by a lead actor in a play in 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the second and fifth rows of the table. Both entries confirm Thomas Sadoski's nomination for the \"best performance by a leading actor in a play.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"best performance by a leading actor in a play\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"outstanding actor in a play\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion. The claim is: \"reason to be pretty be nominate for best play more than 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. It seems to suggest that there's a reason why someone was nominated for 'best play' multiple times. Let me go through the table row by row.\n\nLooking at the first row: Year is 2009, award ceremony is Tony Award, category is best play, nominee is Neil Labute, and result is nominated. So Neil Labute was nominated for best play in 2009. That's one nomination.\n\nNext, second row: Same year, same award and category, but the nominee is Thomas Sadoski. He's also nominated for best play. That's two nominations so far.\n\nThird row: Again, Tony Award for best play, nominee is Marin Ireland, who was also nominated. Now that's three nominations in the best play category.\n\nWait, the claim says \"more than 1 time.\" So if there are multiple people nominated for best play, does that count as the same person being nominated multiple times or different people?\n\nHmm, the claim doesn't specify whether it's the same person or different nominees. From the table, in 2009, under the Tony Award and best play category, three different nominees were named: Neil Labute, Thomas Sadoski, and Marin Ireland. Each was individually nominated for best play, so each nomination is a separate instance.\n\nTherefore, since there are multiple people (more than one) who were nominated for best play in 2009, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to find all rows where the category is 'best play' because that's what the claim is about. So looking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: category is 'best play'\n- Row 1: same\n- Row 2: same\n\nRows 3 and onwards are for different categories (like outstanding play, actor, director), so they don't apply here.\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 0, 1, and 2. Each of these has the category 'best play' which is central to the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "claim": "before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table lists awards and nominees from 2009, including Tony Awards, Drama Desk Awards, and Theatre World Awards. The claim says: \"Before 2009, be the only year that Reason To Be Pretty had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award ceremony.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in 2009, \"Reason To Be Pretty\" was nominated for a Drama Desk Award, and prior to 2009, it was the only year they had a nominee there. So, I should look into whether \"Reason To Be Pretty\" was indeed nominated in 2009 and if any other years before 2009 also had them nominated.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nI'll go through each row step by step.\n\nRow 0: Year is 2009, Award Ceremony is Tony Award. Categories include Best Play, Best Performance by a Leading Actor, etc., but I don't see \"Reason To Be Pretty\" as a nominee here.\n\nRow 1: Same year and ceremony, but different categories, again no mention of \"Reason To Be Pretty.\"\n\nRow 2: Same as above.\n\nRows 3-5: These are the Drama Desk Awards. The first row under Drama Desk is \"outstanding play,\" and the category is \"outstanding play.\" The nominee here is \"outstanding play.\" That's not the same as \"Reason To Be Pretty.\" Next, outstanding actor in a play with Thomas Sadoski as the nominee, then outstanding director with Terry Kinney.\n\nRow 6: Theatre World Award, which goes to Marin Ireland. No mention of \"Reason To Be Pretty.\"\n\nWait, so I'm looking for any row where the category or nominee is \"Reason To Be Pretty.\" In all the rows provided, I don't see that name. The closest is the category \"outstanding play\" and the nominees listed are either plays or people's names.\n\nSo, according to the table, in 2009, \"Reason To Be Pretty\" wasn't nominated for a Drama Desk Award. Therefore, the claim must be false because it says they had a nominee that year when the table shows they didn't. Also, since there's no information about prior years, I can't confirm if they had any nominees before 2009 based on this data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. The claim could be implying that in 2009, \"Reason To Be Pretty\" was the only one among previous years to have a Drama Desk nomination. But since the table doesn't show any prior years beyond 2009, it's unclear if they had any before. However, based solely on what's given, I can only confirm that 2009 didn't have a nomination.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is false because \"Reason To Be Pretty\" wasn't nominated in 2009 for a Drama Desk Award.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
