In the Polish column, under Friday, it says \"pi\u0105tek.\" So that seems to match the claim.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the word Saturday in the Croatian language is subota.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several languages listed for each day of the week. The relevant columns here are 'croatian' and 'saturday.' \n\nIn the 'croatian' column under 'saturday', the term is 'subota.' So that matches exactly with what the claim is stating.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the word for Saturday in Croatian is subota. This makes the claim true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"croatian\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "subota be the mongolian word for sunday",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"subota be the mongolian word for sunday\" is true or false by checking the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday. So, I need to find out if \"subota\" appears in the table as a translation for Sunday and whether it's listed under the Mongolian language columns.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are multiple languages listed for each day of the week. The relevant columns for this check would be those under the Mongolian languages because that's where the claim is about. In the table, I see two sections for Mongolian: one labeled \"mongolian (numerical)\" and another as \"mongolian (tibetan)\". I should focus on these.\n\nIn the \"mongolian (numerical)\" section, the days are given in numerical order with their names in Mongolian script. The last row here is labeled as \"sunday\" or \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\". Wait, no, looking again: the last entry under \"mongolian (numerical)\" is actually \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\", which translates to \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\". That might be the word for Sunday.\n\nThen there's the \"mongolian (tibetan)\" column. The last day here is labeled as \"\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043c nyam\", which I think corresponds to Sunday in Tibetan, not Mongolian.\n\nSo, the claim says that \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday. Let me check if \"subota\" appears anywhere in the table under the Mongolian sections. In the \"mongolian (tibetan)\" column, I see \"\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043c nyam\", which doesn't match \"subota\". Under \"mongolian (numerical)\", the last day is \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\" or \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\". The term for Sunday in Mongolian script might be \"Sunday\" itself, but in the table, it's given as \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\".\n\nWait, I need to check if \"subota\" is a variant or equivalent of that. From what I recall, \"subota\" is actually the Turkish word for Saturday, not Sunday. So, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nLooking back at the table, under the Turkish column, Saturday is indeed listed as \"cumartesi\". So, \"subota\" isn't in the Turkish section, but in another language? Wait, no, \"subota\" might be a misspelling or confusion. Let me check other languages to see if it's used for Sunday elsewhere.\n\nIn the table, under the Chinese (Pinyin) column, Sunday is listed as \"\u661f\u671f\u65e5\" or \"x\u012bngq\u00edr\u00ec\". Under Mongolian, it's \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\". The claim says \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday. But in the table, I don't see \"subota\" as a translation. Instead, it seems like the Mongolian words are different.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is incorrect because \"subota\" isn't listed as the Mongolian term for Sunday. In fact, under the Tibetan part of Mongolian, it's \"\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043c nyam\", and in the numerical part, it's \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\". Therefore, the correct Mongolian word for Sunday isn't \"subota\".\n\nWait, but I might be misunderstanding. Let me double-check each section.\n\nIn the \"mongolian (numerical)\" column, the days are:\n\n1. \u043d\u044d\u0433 \u0434\u044d\u0445 \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 neg dekh \u00f6d\u00f6r (Monday)\n2. \u0445\u043e\u0451\u0440 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 hoyor dahi \u00f6d\u00f6r (Tuesday)\n3. \u0433\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 gurav dahi \u00f6d\u00f6r (Wednesday)\n4. \u0434\u04e9\u0440\u04e9\u0432 \u0434\u044d\u0445 \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 d\u00f6r\u00f6v dekh \u00f6d\u00f6r (Thursday)\n5. \u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 tav dahi \u00f6d\u00f6r (Friday)\n6. \u0445\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 hagas sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r (Saturday)\n7. \u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r (Sunday)\n\nSo Sunday is \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\", which is different from \"subota\". Therefore, the claim that \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday is incorrect.\n\nWait, but I also need to check if \"subota\" appears in any other column. Let me look through all columns again.\n\nLooking at the Turkish column: The days are pazartesi (Monday), sal\u0131 (Tuesday), \u00e7ar\u015famba (Wednesday), per\u015fembe (Thursday), cuma (Friday), cumartesi (Saturday), pazar (Sunday). So, Sunday is \"pazar\" in Turkish. That's not \"subota\".\n\nIn the Chinese column: \u661f\u671f\u4e00 to \u661f\u671f\u65e5, which are Monday to Sunday. No \"subota\" there.\n\nIn the Tibetan part of Mongolian, it's \"\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043c nyam\" for Sunday, again not \"subota\".\n\nSo, nowhere in the table does \"subota\" appear as a translation for Sunday. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because \"subota\" isn't listed as the Mongolian word for Sunday in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"mongolian (numerical)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"mongolian (tibetan)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
