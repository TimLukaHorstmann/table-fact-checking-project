Ford was the highest scorer with 24 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the relevant row in the table. The date mentioned is December 23, so I'll scan down the 'date' column to find that entry.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 28: december 23\n- Row 27: portland\n- Wait, no, row 28 is december 23 vs seattle, and row 29 is minnesota on dec 27. So row 28 is December 23.\n\nNow, checking the 'high points' column for that row. The high points for December 23 (row 28) are T.J. Ford with 24 points.\n\nSo, according to the table, T.J. Ford scored 24 points on December 23. There's no other player mentioned in that game who had higher points than him. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"for game on december 20, the high point get more than 25.\" So, first, I should find the relevant game in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with attributes like date, team, score, and others. I'm looking for the game played on December 20th. Scanning through the 'date' column, I see that December 20 is game number 26, which is against the Los Angeles Clippers. The team won with a score of 98-96 in overtime.\n\nNext, I need to check the high points column for that specific game. The high points are listed as Fred Jones (23). So, the highest points in this game were scored by Fred Jones, who had 23 points.\n\nThe claim states that the high point got more than 25. However, Fred Jones only scored 23 points. That's less than 25. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the high points for the game on December 20. The high scorer was Fred Jones with 23 points, which is not more than 25.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
