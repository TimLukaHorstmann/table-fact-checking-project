    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe table has four columns: year, title, us, us r&b, and us dance. The rows are for different years from 1984 to 1988. Each row provides data for these categories related to some titles.\n\nThe claim is: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9.\"\n\nSo I need to check if in the year 1986, there's a us dance value that corresponds to a us r&b value of 9. Let me look at the table.\n\nLooking at the table, let's focus on 1986 first. There are two entries for 1986:\n\n1. \"under the influence\" with us=56, us r&b=9, us dance=6\n2. \"animals\" with all values as -.\n\nSo in 1986, there is a title called \"under the influence.\" For that title, us dance is 6 when us r&b is 9. That seems to match the claim exactly.\n\nBut I should make sure there are no other entries for 1986. The second entry, \"animals,\" has - values, so it doesn't affect this particular condition because the claim refers to a situation where us r&b is 9 and us dance is 6, which only applies to \"under the influence.\"\n\nTherefore, the data supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we check the relevant cells in the table. In 1986, for \"under the influence,\" when us r&b is 9, us dance is indeed 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify which cells in the table support that claim. The claim given is: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the structure of the table provided. It has four columns: year, title, us, us r&b, and us dance. There are five rows corresponding to different years from 1984 to 1988.\n\nThe claim mentions \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\" So, I'm trying to parse what this means. It seems like they're referring to a specific entry in the table where the title is \"under the influence,\" the value under \"us\" is 56, and it's present in both 1985 and 1986.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1985, the row has the title \"mechanical emotion\" with us=107. There's no entry for \"under the influence\" here.\n- In 1986, there are two entries: one is \"under the influence\" with us=56 and another is \"animals\" which doesn't have any values filled in (-,-).\n  \nSo, focusing on 1986, we see that \"under the influence\" has a us value of 56. But wait, the claim mentions both 1985 and 1986. In 1985, there's no \"under the influence\" entry; it's only present in 1986 with the us value as 56.\n\nNow, I need to check if \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\" is fully supported by the table. The key points are:\n\n1. Does \"under the influence\" exist in both 1985 and 1986? No, it only exists in 1986.\n2. Is there a us value of 56 for \"under the influence\" in both years? Again, no, because in 1985, that title doesn't exist.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because \"under the influence\" isn't present in 1985 and doesn't have a 56 in both years mentioned. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: we need to find any cells that support the claim. Even though the claim is false, the table does have an entry for \"under the influence\" with us=56 in 1986. So, the relevant cell is where year=1986, title=\"under the influence\", and column \"us\" has the value 56.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect that this specific cell exists but doesn't validate the entire claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to an entry in both 1985 and 1986 for \"under the influence\" with a us value of 56. However, the table only shows this entry in 1986, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
