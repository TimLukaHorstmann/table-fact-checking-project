    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"until 2012 , black actress have only win 7 golden globe\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. First, I'll carefully analyze each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the table data.\n\nThe claim mentions that until 2012, black actresses have only won 7 Golden Globes. So, my goal is to count how many times a black actress won a Golden Globe up to the year 2012 based on the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row and identify where the year is less than or equal to 2012. For each relevant row, I'll check if the actor is a black actress and whether she won an award (result is \"won\").\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. **1960**: Juanita Moore - Nominated.\n2. **1960**: Dorothy Dandridge - Nominated.\n3. **1962**: Claudia McNeil - Nominated.\n4. **1968**: Beah Richards - Nominated.\n5. **1969**: Abbey Lincoln - Nominated.\n6. **1971**: Lola Falana - Nominated.\n7. **1973**: Diana Ross - New Star (won) and Best Actress (nominated).\n   - Counted as 1 win here because she won \"New Star - Actress.\"\n8. **1975**: Diahann Carroll - Nominated.\n9. **1981**: Irene Cara - Nominated.\n10. **1984**: Jennifer Beals - Nominated.\n11. **1986**: Oprah Winfrey - Nominated, Whoopi Goldberg - Won (Best Actress).\n    - So here, Whoopi won, adding 2 wins.\n12. **1991**: Whoopi Goldberg - Won (Supporting Actress), adding another win.\n13. **1993**: Whoopi Goldberg - Nominated, Alfre Woodard - Nominated.\n14. **1994**: Angela Bassett - Won, so that's another win.\n15. **1997**: Marianne Jean-Baptiste - Nominated.\n16. **1998**: Pam Grier - Nominated.\n17. **2002**: Halle Berry - Nominated.\n18. **2003**: Queen Latifah - Nominated.\n19. **2007**: Jennifer Hudson - Won (Supporting Actress), adding another win.\n    - Also, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles - Nominated.\n20. **2009**: Viola Davis - Nominated.\n21. **2010**: Mo'Nique - Won, and Gabourey Sidibe - Nominated.\n22. **2011**: Halle Berry - Nominated.\n23. **2012**: Viola Davis - Nominated, Octavia Spencer - Won (Supporting Actress).\n\nNow, let's tally up the wins:\n\n- Diana Ross: 1\n- Whoopi Goldberg: 2 (1991 and 1986)\n- Angela Bassett: 1\n- Jennifer Hudson: 1\n- Mo'Nique: 1\n- Octavia Spencer: 1\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 wins.\n\nThe claim says \"until 2012, black actresses have only won 7 Golden Globes.\" Based on the table, this seems accurate. Each of these women received a Golden Globe win up to 2012, totaling exactly 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "claim": "the longest drought between nomination have be 6 year , between 1962 - 68 and 1975 - 1981",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the longest drought between nomination has been 6 years, between 1962 - 68 and 1975 - 1981.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what a \"drought\" in this context means. It likely refers to the number of consecutive years an actor was not nominated for an award. So, if someone was nominated in 1962 and then again in 1968, that's a gap of 6 years without a nomination.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each actor's \"year\" and \"result\" columns. The claim mentions two periods: 1962-68 and 1975-1981. So I should look for actors who were nominated in 1962 and then next nominated in 1968 or later, ensuring there's a gap of at least six years.\n\nStarting with 1962: Claudia McNeil was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in 1962 for \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" Her next nomination wasn't until... Wait, checking further down, I don't see her being nominated again. So she might have only one nomination, which doesn't create a drought.\n\nLooking for actors who were nominated in both periods: For example, Diana Ross was nominated in 1973 for Best Actress - Drama and also in 1973 for New Star - Actress. But that's the same year, so no gap there.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg is another actor to check. She was nominated in 1986 for Best Supporting Actress and again in 1991 for the same category. The gap between 1986 and 1991 is five years, not six. So that doesn't qualify as the longest drought.\n\nLooking at 1975-1981: Diahn Caroll was nominated in 1975, but she didn't get another nomination until... Let me see, no, she only has one nomination listed here. Angela Bassett was nominated in 1994 and won in 1994, so her next was later, but the claim is about a drought, not consecutive nominations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for actors who were not nominated for several years between two specified periods. For instance, someone who was last nominated in 1962 and then again in 1968\u2014so six years without a nomination (from 1963 to 1967). But looking at the table, I don't see any actors who fit that exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering actors who had a significant gap between their two nominations. For example, if someone was last nominated in 1962 and then again in 1968, that's six years apart. Similarly, if someone was last nominated in 1975 and next in 1981, also six years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1962: Claudia McNeil was last nominated there. I don't see her being nominated again. So no drought.\n- In 1975: Diahn Caroll was last nominated there. She doesn't get another nomination until... Wait, she's only listed in 1975. So if she only had one nomination, that doesn't create a drought.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about the longest period between two consecutive nominations without any in between. So maybe looking at actors who were last nominated in one year and then again six years later.\n\nBut based on the table, I don't see such cases. For example:\n\n- Beah Richards was last nominated in 1968 for \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\" She doesn't get another nomination after that.\n- Abbey Lincoln was last in 1969; no more nominations.\n- Lola Falana only has one nomination in 1971, so no drought there.\n\nDiana Ross was last nominated in 1973. Then she won in 1973 for Best Actress - Drama, and then again in 1973 for New Star - Actress, which is the same year. So that doesn't create a gap.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg's last nomination before 1986 was... She didn't have one earlier? She first got a nomination in 1986. So maybe she wasn't nominated before, so no drought.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about actors who were both nominated and won, but went without being nominated for six years. But from the table, I don't see any such case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that between 1962 and 1968, if an actor was only last nominated in 1962 and then next in 1968, that's a six-year gap. Similarly, if someone was last in 1975 and next in 1981, that's another six years.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn the table, there are actors like Claudia McNeil (1962) who don't get another nomination. So no drought for them.\n\nDiahann Carroll was last in 1975; no further nominations listed.\n\nAngela Bassett was last in 1994, so if she didn't get another until much later, but the claim is up to 1981, so maybe not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to the time between an actor's two consecutive nominations being six years. So if someone was last nominated in year X and then next in X+6, that would be a drought of five years without a nomination (from X+1 to X+5).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1962: Claudia McNeil. Next mention is nothing.\n- In 1968: No one else. Wait, I don't see anyone with a nomination in 1968 except Beah Richards, who was last in 1968.\n\nWait, Beah Richards was last nominated in 1968. If she didn't get another after that, then her last nomination was 1968, so no drought beyond that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says the longest drought is six years between two nominations. So if an actor was last nominated in X and next in X+6, that's a gap of five years without any (from X+1 to X+5). But in reality, the period without a nomination would be from X+1 to X+5, which is five years. Wait, no\u2014if they were last in 1962 and next in 1968, that's six years between them. So the gap is 1963-1967, which is five years without a nomination.\n\nBut the claim says \"between 1962 - 68 and 1975 - 1981.\" Wait, perhaps it's considering the time between two separate periods. Like from 1962 to 1968 (six years) and then again in 1975-1981 (another six years). So maybe they are saying that there have been two instances of six-year droughts.\n\nBut I don't see any actor who was last nominated in 1962 and next in 1968. Or last in 1975 and next in 1981.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the time between an actor's last nomination and their next one being six years. So if someone was last in X and next in X+6, that's a drought of five years without any in between.\n\nBut based on the table, I don't see such cases. For example:\n\n- Claudia McNeil: Last in 1962, no next.\n- Beah Richards: Last in 1968, no next.\n- Diana Ross: Last in 1973, won in 1973 for Best Actress - Drama, but that's same year as another category.\n- Whoopi Goldberg: First nomination in 1986, so can't have a drought before that.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are no actors in the table who had a six-year gap between their last and next nominations. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which actors to look at.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is referring to the time between two consecutive nominations being six years, regardless of the actor. But that would require an actor having two nominations with a six-year gap.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- In 1962: Claudia McNeil.\n- Then in 1968: Beah Richards.\nSo the difference is 6 years (1962 to 1968). So if Claudia and Beah are different actors, then between their last and next, there's a six-year gap. But does that count as a drought for each of them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that from 1963-1967, there was a period of five years without any nominations in their categories.\n\nBut the claim says \"the longest drought between nomination has been 6 years,\" so maybe it's referring to a single actor having two nominations with six years in between. But based on the table, I don't see that happening.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct because between 1962 and 1968, no one was nominated in those years, making it a six-year drought. Similarly between 1975-1981.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\nIn 1963: No nominations listed beyond Claudia McNeil in 1962.\nSame for 1964, 1965, etc., up to 1967: Only Beah Richards in 1968.\n\nSo from 1963 to 1967, only Claudia and Beah were last in 1962 and next in 1968. So the period between 1963-1967 is five years without a nomination for Claudia, making her drought of six years (from 1963-1968), but she was only last in 1962.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the answer is that the claim is false because there are no actors in the table who had a six-year gap between their last and next nominations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering that between 1962 and 1968, six years passed without any new nominations, implying a drought. Similarly for 1975-1981.\n\nBut in reality, Beah Richards was last in 1968, so she didn't have any after. So from 1963-1967, there were no other nominations except Claudia in 1962 and Beah in 1968.\n\nTherefore, the period between 1962 and 1968 had a six-year gap where only two actors were nominated (Claudia and Beah). But that doesn't necessarily mean it's a drought for each of them; rather, there was a time with fewer nominations.\n\nI'm not sure if this is what the claim refers to. Alternatively, maybe the user considers that between 1962-1968 and 1975-1981, there were six-year gaps where no one was nominated, making it a drought for those periods.\n\nBut without more data on other actors, I can't confirm that.\n\nGiven all this confusion, I think the answer is that the claim is false because based on the table provided, there are no actors with a six-year gap between their last and next nominations.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the longest drought between nominations is six years is **false**. Based on the data provided, there are no actors who had a six-year gap between their last and next nominations. The period from 1962 to 1968 did not result in any actor having such a significant gap, as each actor's last nomination was followed by another within the same or subsequent year without an extended drought. Therefore, the statement does not hold true based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: **False**",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the most common golden globe for a black actress to win be for best support actress\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that among all Golden Globe wins by black actresses, the majority are in the category of Best Supporting Actress. So, my task is to analyze the table and see if this is true or not.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, an actress, the award category, the movie, and whether she won or was nominated. I'm particularly interested in rows where the result is \"won\" because those are actual wins, not just nominations.\n\nI'll go through each row to identify where black actresses have won their awards:\n\n1. **1960 - Juanita Moore**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n2. **1960 - Dorothy Dandridge**: Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n3. **1962 - Claudia McNeil**: Nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n4. **1968 - Beah Richards**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n5. **1969 - Abbey Lincoln**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n6. **1971 - Lola Falana**: Nominated for New Star - Actress.\n7. **1973 - Diana Ross**: She has two entries here:\n   - **New Star - Actress** win in 1973.\n   - **Best Actress - Drama** nomination for the same year.\n8. **1975 - Diahann Carroll**: Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n9. **1981 - Irene Cara**: Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n10. **1984 - Jennifer Beals**: Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n11. **1986 - Oprah Winfrey**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n12. **1986 - Whoopi Goldberg**: She has two entries here:\n    - **Best Actress - Drama** win in 1986.\n13. **1991 - Whoopi Goldberg**: Won Best Supporting Actress for \"Ghost.\"\n14. **1993 - Whoopi Goldberg**: Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n15. **1993 - Alfre Woodard**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n16. **1994 - Angela Bassett**: She has two entries here:\n    - **Best Actress - Musical or Comedy** win in 1994.\n17. **1997 - Marianne Jean-Baptiste**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n18. **1998 - Pam Grier**: Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n19. **2002 - Halle Berry**: Nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n20. **2003 - Queen Latifah**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n21. **2007 - Jennifer Hudson**: She has two entries here:\n    - **Best Supporting Actress** win in 2007.\n22. **2007 - Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles**: Nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n23. **2009 - Viola Davis**: Nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n24. **2010 - Mo'Nique**: She has two entries here:\n    - **Best Supporting Actress** win in 2010.\n25. **2010 - Gabourey Sidibe**: Nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n26. **2011 - Halle Berry**: Nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n27. **2012 - Viola Davis**: Nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n28. **2012 - Octavia Spencer**: She has two entries here:\n    - **Best Supporting Actress** win in 2012.\n\nNow, I'll count the number of times a black actress won an award:\n\n- Diana Ross: 1 win (New Star - Actress).\n- Whoopi Goldberg: 2 wins (Best Actress - Drama and Best Supporting Actress).\n- Angela Bassett: 1 win (Best Actress - Musical or Comedy).\n- Jennifer Hudson: 1 win (Best Supporting Actress).\n- Mo'Nique: 1 win (Best Supporting Actress).\n- Octavia Spencer: 1 win (Best Supporting Actress).\n\nWait, that's a total of six wins so far. Let me double-check to see if I missed any:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Diana Ross won in 1973 for New Star - Actress.\n- Whoopi Goldberg won twice: once as Best Actress - Drama and once as Best Supporting Actress.\n- Angela Bassett won in 1994 for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n- Jennifer Hudson won in 2007 for Best Supporting Actress.\n- Mo'Nique won in 2010 for Best Supporting Actress.\n- Octavia Spencer won in 2012 for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThat's six wins. But wait, I think I might have missed a couple more:\n\nWait, let me recount each row where \"result\" is \"won\":\n\nLooking through the rows again:\n\n- Diana Ross: 1\n- Whoopi Goldberg: 2\n- Angela Bassett: 1\n- Jennifer Hudson: 1\n- Mo'Nique: 1\n- Octavia Spencer: 1\n\nThat's six wins.\n\nNow, I need to see how many times they won in the Best Supporting Actress category versus other categories.\n\nFrom the above:\n\n- Diana Ross: New Star - Actress (not Best Supporting Actress).\n- Whoopi Goldberg: One win as Best Actress - Drama and one as Best Supporting Actress.\n- Angela Bassett: Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n- Jennifer Hudson: Best Supporting Actress.\n- Mo'Nique: Best Supporting Actress.\n- Octavia Spencer: Best Supporting Actress.\n\nSo, out of the six wins:\n\n- 3 wins in Best Supporting Actress (Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Hudson, Mo'Nique, Octavia Spencer? Wait, Whoopi Goldberg has one win as Best Supporting Actress. So that's four: Whoopi, Jennifer, Mo'Nique, Octavia? Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, Whoopi Goldberg won twice: once in Best Actress - Drama and once in Best Supporting Actress. So her two wins are in different categories.\n\nSo the breakdown is:\n\n- Best Supporting Actress wins: Whoopi Goldberg (1), Jennifer Hudson (1), Mo'Nique (1), Octavia Spencer (1). That's four.\n- Best Actress - Drama wins: Whoopi Goldberg (1).\n- Best Actress - Musical or Comedy win: Angela Bassett (1).\n\nSo total of six wins, with four in Best Supporting Actress and two in other categories.\n\nBut the claim is that \"the most common\" category for black actresses' Golden Globe wins is Best Supporting Actress. So if there are more wins in Best Supporting Actress than in any other category, then the statement holds.\n\nIn this case, since there are four Best Supporting Actress wins versus two others (Best Actress - Drama and Best Actress - Musical or Comedy), it seems that Best Supporting Actress is indeed the most common category for their wins.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are more black actresses who have won in Best Supporting Actress. Let me see:\n\nLooking through all rows again, focusing on \"result\" = \"won\":\n\n- Diana Ross: New Star - Actress (not Best Supporting).\n- Whoopi Goldberg: 1 win as Best Supporting.\n- Angela Bassett: Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n- Jennifer Hudson: Best Supporting.\n- Mo'Nique: Best Supporting.\n- Octavia Spencer: Best Supporting.\n\nSo that's four wins in Best Supporting, one in Best Actress - Drama (Whoopi), and one in Best Actress - Musical or Comedy (Angela Bassett).\n\nThus, the majority of their wins are in Best Supporting Actress. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the data provided.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are more actresses who won but aren't listed in the table. But since we don't have access to all possible winners, we can only analyze the ones provided. Within this dataset, the majority of wins by black actresses are indeed in Best Supporting Actress.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data. Among the black actresses who won Golden Globes in the provided list, a majority of their wins were in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows with \"Result\" = \"Won\":** Focus on rows where the actress actually won an award.\n2. **Categorize Each Win:** Note the award category for each win by a black actress.\n3. **Tally Wins by Category:** Count how many wins occurred in Best Supporting Actress versus other categories.\n4. **Compare with Claim:** Determine if Best Supporting Actress has the most wins.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided data, the majority of Golden Globe wins by black actresses are indeed in the Best Supporting Actress category, making the claim TRUE.\n\nAnswer: True",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about an award being won only by Whoopi Goldberg in 1986 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim exactly states. It says: \"the award for best actress in drama have only be win by whoopi goldberg in 1986.\" So, the claim is suggesting that in 1986, Whoopi Goldberg won the Best Actress in Drama award and that she was the only one to do so.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on the columns relevant to the claim. The key columns here are 'year', 'actor', 'award', and 'motion picture'. Since the claim is about the Best Actress in Drama award, I'll need to check each row where the award category matches this description.\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\n1. 1960: Dorothy Dandridge won Best Actress - Musical or Comedy for \"Porgy & Bess.\" Not relevant as it's a musical/comedy category and also, she didn't win but was nominated.\n\n2. 1962: Claudia McNeil was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" She didn't win, so not relevant to the claim.\n\n3. 1968: Beah Richards was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\" Not relevant as it's supporting and also, she didn't win.\n\n4. 1969: Abbey Lincoln was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"For Love of Ivy.\" Again, supporting actress category and not a win.\n\n5. 1971: Lola Falana won New Star - Actress for \"The Liberation of L.B. Jones.\" Not relevant as it's a different category.\n\n6. 1973: Diana Ross was both nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"Lady Sings the Blues\" and also won New Star - Actress, which is a different category.\n\n7. 1975: Diahann Carroll was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy in \"Claudine.\"\n\n8. 1981: Irene Cara was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy in \"Fame.\"\n\n9. 1984: Jennifer Beals was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy in \"Flashdance.\"\n\n10. 1986: Oprah Winfrey was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"The Color Purple.\" Whoopi Goldberg, on the other hand, won Best Actress - Drama in \"The Color Purple\" that same year.\n\n11. 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won Best Supporting Actress in \"Ghost.\"\n\n12. 1993: She was again nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy in \"Sister Act.\"\n\n13. 1994: Angela Bassett won Best Actress - Musical or Comedy in \"What's Love Got to Do with It.\"\n\n14. 1997: Marianne Jean-Baptiste was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"Secrets & Lies.\"\n\n15. 1998: Pam Grier was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy in \"Jackie Brown.\"\n\n16. 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"Monster's Ball.\"\n\n17. 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"Chicago.\"\n\n18. 2007: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress in \"Dreamgirls,\" and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n\n19. 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"Doubt.\"\n\n20. 2010: Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress for \"Precious,\" while Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n\n21. 2011: Halle Berry was again nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"Frankie and Alice.\"\n\n22. 2012: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"The Help,\" and Octavia Spencer won Best Supporting Actress that same year.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific claim: the award for Best Actress in Drama has only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1986.\n\nFrom the table, I see that Whoopi Goldberg did win a Best Actress - Drama award. She won it in 1991 for \"Ghost\" and in 2012 for \"The Help.\" Wait, no, looking again, in 2012 she was nominated but didn't win. Actually, looking back:\n\nWait, in 1986, Whoopi Goldberg was not the one winning Best Actress - Drama; instead, she won Best Supporting Actress in \"The Color Purple.\" Meanwhile, in 1991, she won Best Supporting Actress for \"Ghost,\" and in 2012, she was again nominated but didn't win. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait no, let me check the table correctly:\n\nLooking at row 1986: Oprah Winfrey was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, while Whoopi Goldberg was not mentioned here\u2014she might have been in another category or that year? Wait, no, actually, looking back, in 1986, the entry shows Oprah Winfrey as Best Supporting Actress, but Whoopi Goldberg was also in \"The Color Purple\" that same year, so she must have won Best Actress - Drama.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nIn 1986, under the 'actor' column: Oprah Winfrey is listed for Best Supporting Actress. So, that suggests that Whoopi Goldberg might not have been in the same category that year or may have been in a different role. Wait, no, \"The Color Purple\" was released in 1986, and Whoopi Goldberg played Celie, which was a leading role, so she should be in the Best Actress - Drama category.\n\nLooking back at the table, perhaps I misread the 1986 entry. Let me check:\n\nRow 10: 1986, Oprah Winfrey, Best Supporting Actress, The Color Purple.\n\nSo, that suggests that Whoopi Goldberg might have been in a different category or not listed because she was the lead. Alternatively, maybe the table doesn't list all actors, but only those who were nominated or won.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking at row 1986: The actor is Oprah Winfrey, award is Best Supporting Actress for \"The Color Purple.\" So, Whoopi Goldberg was likely in a different category that year, perhaps she was the lead and thus in Best Actress - Drama.\n\nBut looking through the table, I don't see Whoopi Goldberg listed as winning Best Actress - Drama until 2012. Wait, no, actually, in 2012, Viola Davis won Best Supporting Actress for \"The Help,\" while Whoopi Goldberg wasn't involved that time. So perhaps I need to correct my earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't list all actors, only those who were nominated or won. So, Whoopi Goldberg likely won Best Actress - Drama in 1986 for \"The Color Purple.\" But according to the table, in 1986, Oprah Winfrey was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, so perhaps Whoopi Goldberg was indeed the winner that year.\n\nBut wait, the claim says she only won it once, in 1986. However, from the table, I can see that Whoopi Goldberg also won Best Supporting Actress in 1991 for \"Ghost\" and again in 2012 (though she didn't win, as Viola Davis did). So, if the claim is that she only won Best Actress - Drama once, but according to the table, she might have only done so once.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table, I don't see Whoopi Goldberg winning Best Actress - Drama again after 1986. She was only mentioned in 1991 as a winner of Best Supporting Actress and then in 2012, not winning but being nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is partially correct\u2014she did win Best Actress - Drama once in 1986, but she also won another award in 1991. Therefore, the claim that \"the award for best actress in drama have only been won by whoopi goldberg in 1986\" would be incorrect because she won other awards as well.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim is specifically about Best Actress in Drama. So, if she won it once in 1986 and not again, then the statement would be TRUE. But from the table, I don't see her winning it again. She was only mentioned in 2012 as being nominated for Best Actress - Drama, which suggests she may have been a contender but didn't win.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is correct because she only won Best Actress - Drama once, in 1986. However, from what I recall, Whoopi Goldberg did win an Academy Award (which is Best Actress) for \"The Color Purple\" in 1986. So, that would make the claim accurate.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: In 1986, Whoopi Goldberg won Best Actress - Drama for \"The Color Purple.\" She also won Best Supporting Actress in 1991 for \"Ghost,\" but that's a different category. Therefore, she only has one win in Best Actress - Drama, which is in 1986.\n\nSo, the claim is stating that the award (Best Actress in Drama) has only been won by her once, in 1986. That seems correct based on the table provided because there are no other rows where she won Best Actress - Drama after 1986. She was only nominated again in 2012 but didn't win.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Best Actress in Drama award has only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1986 is TRUE based on the provided table. \n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"From 2000 - 2012, there have been 6 years where a black actress was not nominated for any Golden Globe.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is asking. It's about a time frame (2000 to 2012) and specifically about black actresses who were not nominated in any category for the Golden Globes during those years. The claim states that there are exactly six such years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an award ceremony, with details like the year, actor's name, award category, motion picture, and result (nominated or won). My goal is to go through each of these rows between 2000 and 2012 and count how many times a black actress was not nominated for any Golden Globe. \n\nI'll start by identifying all the relevant rows within that time frame. The table starts from 1960, but I'm only interested in years 2000-2012. Let me go through each year:\n\nStarting from 1960, I see rows up to 2012. Let's list out the years between 2000 and 2012:\n\n2000: Not listed\n2001: Not listed\n2002: Halle Berry - nominated for best actress - drama\n2003: Queen Latifah - nominated for supporting actress\n2007: Jennifer Hudson - won, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles - nominated\n2009: Viola Davis - nominated\n2010: Mo'nique - won, Gabourey Sidibe - nominated\n2011: Halle Berry - nominated\n2012: Viola Davis - nominated, Octavia Spencer - won\n\nWait, actually, the table includes rows from 1960 up to 2012. So let me make a list of all years between 2000 and 2012 that have entries:\n\nLooking at each row's year:\n\n- 1968\n- 1969\n- 1971\n- 1973 (two entries)\n- 1975\n- 1981\n- 1984\n- 1986 (two entries)\n- 1991\n- 1993 (two entries)\n- 1994\n- 1997\n- 1998\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2007 (two entries)\n- 2009\n- 2010 (two entries)\n- 2011\n- 2012 (two entries)\n\nSo the years between 2000 and 2012 with data are: 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nNow I need to go through each of these years and check if a black actress was not nominated in any category. \n\nStarting from 2002:\n\n- Halle Berry: Nominated for best actress - drama. So she was nominated; thus, this year doesn't count as a \"non-nomination\" year.\n- Queen Latifah: Nominated for supporting actress. Also, another nomination, so no.\n2003:\n- Queen Latifah: Nominated for supporting actress. Another one, no.\n2007:\n- Jennifer Hudson: Won best supporting actress. So she was nominated, but since she won, does that count? The claim is about not being nominated at all. If someone wins, it means they were nominated. So even if they won, they were still nominated, so this year doesn't count.\n- Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles: Nominated for best actress - musical or comedy. Another nomination, so no.\n2009:\n- Viola Davis: Nominated for supporting actress. No.\n2010:\n- Mo'nique: Won best supporting actress, which means she was nominated. So even though she won, she was still nominated.\n- Gabourey Sidibe: Nominated for best actress - drama. Another nomination, so no.\n2011:\n- Halle Berry: Nominated for best actress - drama. No.\n2012:\n- Viola Davis: Nominated for best actress - drama.\n- Octavia Spencer: Won best supporting actress, which means she was nominated.\n\nWait a second, in 2007, both Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles were either winning or nominated. So that year counts as having at least one black actress who was not only not winning but also was not even nominated? No, because if they won, they were definitely nominated. The claim is about years where a black actress was not nominated for any Golden Globe. So if she won, she was still nominated, so those years don't count.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at 2007:\n- Jennifer Hudson: Won best supporting actress. That means she was nominated.\n- Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles: Nominated for best actress - musical or comedy.\n\nSo both were either winning or nominated. Therefore, 2007 does not count as a year where a black actress wasn't even nominated.\n\nSame with 2010:\n- Mo'nique: Won, so she was nominated.\n- Gabourey Sidibe: Nominated, so she was also in it.\n\nNow, looking through all these years (2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012), I don't see any year where a black actress wasn't nominated for any award. Each time, there's at least one black actress who was either winning or nominated.\n\nWait, but the claim is that in six of those years, no black actress was nominated. So if I can't find even one such year between 2000-2012, then the claim would be false.\n\nBut maybe I missed something. Let me go through each relevant row again.\n\nStarting with 2002: Halle Berry - nominated. No non-nomination.\n2003: Queen Latifah - nominated.\n2007: Both Hudson and Knowles were either winning or nominated.\n2009: Viola Davis - nominated.\n2010: Mo'nique won, Sidibe - nominated.\n2011: Halle Berry - nominated.\n2012: Two actors, both either winning or nominated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Are there any years in that range where no black actresses were even nominated? Let me think about the categories: Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and possibly Best Director if it's included, but looking at the table, most are acting awards.\n\nBut from what I can see, every year between 2000-2012 has at least one black actress either winning or being nominated. So there would be zero years where a black actress wasn't even nominated, not six.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that there were six such years when in reality, none exist in this timeframe.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that from 2000 to 2012 there were six years where no black actresses were nominated for Golden Globes is **FALSE**. Upon reviewing the provided data, every year within this timeframe had at least one black actress either winning or being nominated. Therefore, there are zero such years.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; there are no years between 2000 and 2012 where a black actress was not nominated for any Golden Globe.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by carefully checking each condition against the given table of Oscar award nominations for Black actresses.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be more than 2 drought spell span more than 6 year where black actoresses get no nomination.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that there are periods (drought spells) longer than 6 years during which Black actresses received no Oscar nominations. So, my task is to check if such periods exist in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an actress, her award category, movie, and whether she was nominated or won. The key columns here are \"year\" and whether they were \"nominated\" or \"won.\" Since we're looking for times when Black actresses didn't get nominations, I need to see if there are consecutive years without any nominations.\n\nI'll go through each row year by year and note which actress was nominated in those years.\n\nStarting from 1960:\n\n- 1960: Two Black actresses were nominated (Juanita Moore and Dorothy Dandridge).\n- 1962: Claudia McNeil was nominated.\n- 1968: Beah Richards was nominated.\n- 1969: Abbey Lincoln was nominated.\n- 1971: Lola Falana was nominated.\n- 1973: Diana Ross got two nominations, Cicely Tyson as well.\n- 1975: Diahann Carroll was nominated.\n- 1981: Irene Cara was nominated.\n- 1984: Jennifer Beals was nominated.\n- 1986: Two Black actresses were nominated (Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg).\n- 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won, so she got a nomination.\n- 1993: Both Whoopi Goldberg and Alfre Woodard were nominated.\n- 1994: Angela Bassett won.\n- 1997: Marianne Jean-Baptiste was nominated.\n- 1998: Pam Grier was nominated.\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won, and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated.\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated.\n- 2010: Mo'Nique won, and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated.\n- 2011: Halle Berry was nominated.\n- 2012: Both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer were nominated.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any years beyond 6 where no Black actresses were nominated. Let's list out the years with nominations:\n\nLooking at the table, from 1960 to 2012, every year has at least one Black actress nominated, except maybe 1955? Wait, but the table starts in 1960.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"more than 2 drought spell span more than 6 year.\" So, I think it's looking for periods longer than 6 years where no Black actresses were nominated. From 1960 onwards, each year up to 2012 has at least one nomination. So there are no such droughts beyond 6 years.\n\nWait, but maybe before 1960? The table starts in 1960, so if we consider a period from, say, 1955-1960 (6 years), was there any time where Black actresses didn't get nominations? But the data only starts at 1960. So perhaps the claim is about periods within the data.\n\nBut looking at the data, every year has at least one nomination for a Black actress. Therefore, there are no drought spells of more than 6 years where they weren't nominated. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are droughts spanning more than six consecutive years during which Black actresses received no Oscar nominations. However, examining each year in the table shows that every year from 1960 to 2012 had at least one Black actress nominated. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    # and so on for each row up to 2012\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"until 2012, black actor have only won 9 golden globe.\" First, I should understand what this claim is about. It's talking about black actors who have won Golden Globe awards up until 2012.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an award ceremony by the year, with details like the actor's name, category of the award, the movie, and whether they won or were nominated. My task is to check if black actors won only 9 Golden Globes until 2012.\n\nI'll start by going through each relevant row that could affect this claim. I'm specifically interested in rows where a black actor either won or was nominated for a Golden Globe, especially focusing on the years leading up to and including 2012.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- 1960: Juanita Moore (nominated), Dorothy Dandridge (nominated). These are not black actors; I think Dorothy Dandridge is considered African-American.\nWait, actually, looking at the table, I need to confirm which actors are black. Juanita Moore was an African American actress, and so were many others like Whoopi Goldberg, Cicely Tyson, Angela Bassett, etc.\n\nIn 1960, Dorothy Dandridge was African American but she was only nominated, not winning.\nIn 1968: Beah Richards (nominated). She's African American.\n1969: Abbey Lincoln (nominated).\n1971: Lola Falana (nominated).\n1973: Diana Ross won a \"new star\" award and was also nominated for best actress. She's African American.\nAlso in 1973, Cicely Tyson was nominated.\n1981: Irene Cara (nominated). She's African American.\n1986: Oprah Winfrey was nominated; Whoopi Goldberg won for best actress.\n1991: Whoopi Goldberg won again as supporting actress.\n1993: Whoopi Goldberg was nominated, Alfre Woodard was nominated.\n1994: Angela Bassett won.\n2002: Halle Berry (nominated).\n2007: Jennifer Hudson won, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated.\n2010: Mo'Nique won; Gabourey Sidibe was nominated.\n2011: Halle Berry was nominated.\n2012: Viola Davis was nominated, Octavia Spencer won.\n\nWait, so counting all the Wins for black actors up until 2012:\n\n1973: Diana Ross (new star)\n1994: Angela Bassett\n2007: Jennifer Hudson\n2010: Mo'Nique\n\nThat's four wins. Wait, but I also see that Whoopi Goldberg has two wins in 1991 and another?\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nIn the table, under year 1973, Diana Ross won \"new star\" and was also nominated for best actress. So that's one win.\n\nIn 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won as supporting actress.\n\nIn 1994: Angela Bassett won for musical or comedy.\n\nIn 2007: Jennifer Hudson won supporting actress.\n\nIn 2010: Mo'Nique won.\n\nSo, up to 2012, that's five wins. But the claim says only 9, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some years. Let me go through each year:\n\n1960: Dorothy Dandridge (nominated), Juanita Moore (nominated). So no wins yet.\n1968: Beah Richards (nominated).\n1969: Abbey Lincoln (nominated).\n1971: Lola Falana (nominated).\n1973: Diana Ross won one, and Cicely Tyson was nominated.\n1981: Irene Cara (nominated).\n1986: Oprah Winfrey (nominated), Whoopi Goldberg won the best actress in 1986? Wait no, looking at the table:\n\nIn 1986, Oprah was nominated for supporting actress, and Whoopi Goldberg in that year was also part of The Color Purple. Wait, in the table, it's listed as \"won\" or \"nominated\". So in 1986, Whoopi Goldberg won for best actress? Let me check the table.\n\nLooking at the 1986 row: It says \"won\" for Whoopi Goldberg in best actress - drama category, movie The Color Purple. So that's another win.\n\nSo that adds one more to the count.\n\nThen in 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won again as supporting actress.\n\nIn 1993: Alfre Woodard was nominated.\n1994: Angela Bassett won.\n\n2002: Halle Berry (nominated).\n2007: Jennifer Hudson (won), Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles (nominated).\n2010: Mo'Nique (won), Gabourey Sidibe (nominated).\n2011: Halle Berry (nominated).\n2012: Viola Davis (nominated), Octavia Spencer (won).\n\nSo counting the wins:\n\n1986: Whoopi Goldberg \u2013 1\n1991: Whoopi Goldberg \u2013 2\n1994: Angela Bassett \u2013 3\n2007: Jennifer Hudson \u2013 4\n2010: Mo'Nique \u20135\n\nWait, that's only five. But maybe I missed some earlier ones.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn 1973: Diana Ross (new star category) is considered a win.\n1986: Whoopi Goldberg (best actress)\n1991: Whoopi Goldberg (supporting actress)\n1994: Angela Bassett\n2007: Jennifer Hudson\n2010: Mo'Nique\n\nThat's five. Wait, maybe there's more? Let me check:\n\nWait, in 1973, Diana Ross won for new star, and was also a best actress nominee.\n\nSo total wins up to 2012 are:\n\n1. Diana Ross (1973)\n2. Whoopi Goldberg (1986)\n3. Whoopi Goldberg (1991)\n4. Angela Bassett (1994)\n5. Jennifer Hudson (2007)\n6. Mo'Nique (2010)\n\nThat's six.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 9,\" so perhaps there are more.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some earlier wins before 1986.\n\nLooking at 1968: Beah Richards (nominated), not a win.\n\nIn 1973: Diana Ross won in new star category. So that's one.\n\nIn 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won for supporting actress.\n\nIn 1994: Angela Bassett won.\n\n2007: Jennifer Hudson won.\n\n2010: Mo'Nique won.\n\nSo up to 2012, I count six wins by black actors.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some others. Let me check the table again:\n\nLooking at each year where a black actor might have won:\n\n1960: Dorothy Dandridge (nominee)\n1973: Diana Ross (win), Cicely Tyson (nominated)\n1986: Oprah Winfrey (nominee), Whoopi Goldberg (win)\n1991: Whoopi Goldberg (win)\n1994: Angela Bassett (win)\n2002: Halle Berry (nominee)\n2007: Jennifer Hudson (win), Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles (nominee)\n2010: Mo'Nique (win), Gabourey Sidibe (nominee)\n2012: Viola Davis (nominee), Octavia Spencer (win)\n\nSo that adds up to:\n\n1986: Whoopi Goldberg\n1991: Whoopi Goldberg\n1994: Angela Bassett\n2007: Jennifer Hudson\n2010: Mo'Nique\n2012: Octavia Spencer\n\nThat's six wins. So the claim says until 2012, black actors have only won nine. But according to this, it's more than nine.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the table includes both wins and nominations as part of \"only 9,\" but that doesn't make sense because many were nominated without winning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering other categories or more actors who have won.\n\nWait, no. The user wrote the task to check if the number of wins by black actors until 2012 is nine. But according to my count, it's six.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some years. Let me go through each row again:\n\n1960: Dorothy Dandridge (nom)\n1968: Beah Richards (nom)\n1969: Abbey Lincoln (nom)\n1971: Lola Falana (nom)\n1973: Diana Ross (win), Cicely Tyson (nom)\n1986: Oprah (nom), Whoopi (win)\n1991: Whoopi (win)\n1994: Angela Bassett (win)\n2002: Halle Berry (nom)\n2007: Jennifer Hudson (win), Beyonc\u00e9 (nom)\n2010: Mo'Nique (win), Gabourey Sidibe (nom)\n2012: Viola Davis (nom), Octavia Spencer (win)\n\nSo that's 1986,1991,1994,2007,2010,2012. So six wins.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only nine.\" So perhaps I'm missing some years or actors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in other categories like Best Supporting Actor for men, there are more black winners. For example, I don't have a complete list, but perhaps up to 2012, more than six have won.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count is including both wins and some non-acting categories as part of \"Golden Globe,\" which include TV acting too.\n\nBut in the table provided, all are for movie awards. Let me see if any other black actors in movies have won until 2012:\n\nLooking at other years beyond what's listed: Maybe I missed someone like Denzel Washington or Jamie Foxx, but they might be after 2012.\n\nIn the given data, from the table up to 2012, only six wins by black actors. So the claim says \"only nine,\" which is incorrect because it's actually more than that.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recount:\n\n1. Diana Ross (1973)\n2. Whoopi Goldberg (1986)\n3. Whoopi Goldberg (1991)\n4. Angela Bassett (1994)\n5. Jennifer Hudson (2007)\n6. Octavia Spencer (2012)\n\nThat's six.\n\nBut maybe the claim is considering other categories or more than movie awards, like TV acting, which might have more. But without that info, I can't say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their task, thinking it's nine when actually it's six.\n\nWait, but in any case, based on the table, up to 2012, only six black actors have won movie Golden Globes. So if the claim is \"only nine,\" that's incorrect. Therefore, the answer would be that the statement is false; more than nine have won by then.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that Black actors have only won nine Golden Globes until 2023 is false. Based on the analysis of data provided in the table, up to 2012, there were six wins by Black actors in movie categories. Therefore, the claim underestimates the number of achievements.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is incorrect. As of 2012, more than nine Black actors have won Golden Globes in movie categories.",

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I think they're asking about how often Black actresses have won Best Actress awards at the Golden Globes. So, I need to look into the table provided and see if there are any instances where Black actresses won in the Best Actress category.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a year, actor, award, movie, and result. Let me go through each row to check for Best Actress wins by Black actresses.\n\nStarting from 1960: Juanita Moore was nominated but didn't win. Dorothy Dandridge also got nominated but not won.\n\nIn 1962, Claudia McNeil was nominated, but again, no win. Then in 1968 and 1969, Beah Richards and Abbey Lincoln were both nominated but didn't win.\n\nMoving on to 1971, Lola Falana was a new star actress nominee but not for Best Actress. Diana Ross in 1973 had two entries: she won New Star Actress and was also nominated for Best Actress. So that's one Black actress who got a Best Actress nomination. But did she win? No, the result is 'nominated' for Best Actress.\n\nThen Cicely Tyson was also nominated for Best Actress in 1973 but didn't win. In 1975, Diann Carroll got a nomination but no win. Irene Cara and Jennifer Beals were both nominees without wins.\n\nIn 1986, Oprah Winfrey was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 'The Color Purple,' while Whoopi Goldberg won Best Actress in that category. So that's another Black actress who won a Golden Globe for Best Actress.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg also in 1991 won Best Supporting Actress for 'Ghost.' In 1993, she was again nominated but didn't win for Best Actress in 'Sister Act.' Alfre Woodard got a nomination as well.\n\nIn 1994, Angela Bassett won Best Actress for 'What's Love Got to Do With It.' That's another Black actress who won.\n\nMarianne Jean-Baptiste and Pam Grier followed with nominations but no wins. Halle Berry was nominated in 2002, Queen Latifah in 2003, Jennifer Hudson in 2007, where she won Best Supporting Actress for 'Dreamgirls.'\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles got a nomination that year as well. Viola Davis has been consistently nominated without winning yet. Mo'Nique won in 2010, which is significant\u2014another Black actress who won.\n\nGabourey Sidibe was also a nominee but lost. Halle Berry again in 2011 and Octavia Spencer in 2012, where she won for 'The Help.' \n\nSo putting it all together, I see several instances where Black actresses have won Golden Globes: Whoopi Goldberg in 1986, Angela Bassett in 1994, Mo'Nique in 2010, and Octavia Spencer in 2012. That's four wins so far.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress.\" I think they're asking if it's uncommon or not. But from the table, there are several Black actresses who have won Best Actress awards at the Golden Globes. So the claim that it's the least common is false because there are actually multiple wins by Black actresses.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim doesn't hold based on the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that winning a Golden Globe as Best Actress is uncommon for Black actresses, but the table shows multiple instances where they have won. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 48, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 52, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 56, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the award for best actress in comedy have only been won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988.\" So, first, I need to understand what this claim is asserting.\n\nI should start by looking at the table provided. The table lists various actors, the awards they've received, the motion pictures they were associated with, and whether they were nominated or won. The relevant column here seems to be \"award\" and specifically \"best actress in comedy.\" But wait, in the table, the award categories are more specific. I see entries like \"best actress - musical or comedy,\" so that's probably what the claim is referring to.\n\nNext, I need to check if Whoopi Goldberg has won this award only once in 1988. From the table, let me scan through each row where the award is \"best actress - musical or comedy.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1960: Dorothy Dandridge was nominated for best actress - musical or comedy.\n- 1962: Claudia McNeil was nominated for best actress - drama.\n- 1968: Beah Richards was nominated for best supporting actress, which is a different category.\n- 1969: Abbey Lincoln was nominated for best supporting actress.\n- 1971: Lola Falana was nominated for new star - actress.\n- 1973: Diana Ross won in \"new star - actress\" and was also nominated for best actress - drama.\n- 1975: Diahann Carroll was nominated for best actress - musical or comedy.\n- 1981: Irene Cara was nominated for best actress - musical or comedy.\n- 1984: Jennifer Beals was nominated for the same category.\n- 1986: Oprah Winfrey was nominated for best supporting actress, and Whoopi Goldberg won for best actress - drama in \"The Color Purple.\"\n- 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won for best supporting actress in \"Ghost.\"\n- 1993: She was nominated for best actress - musical or comedy in \"Sister Act.\"\n- 1994: Angela Bassett won for best actress - musical or comedy.\n- 1997: Marianne Jean-Baptiste was nominated for best supporting actress.\n- 1998: Pam Grier was nominated for best actress - musical or comedy.\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for best actress - drama.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated for best supporting actress.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won for best supporting actress, and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for best actress - musical or comedy in \"Dreamgirls.\"\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for best supporting actress.\n- 2010: Mo'Nique won for best supporting actress, and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for best actress - drama.\n- 2011: Halle Berry was nominated again for best actress - drama.\n- 2012: Viola Davis was nominated for best actress - drama, and Octavia Spencer won for best supporting actress in \"The Help.\"\n\nWait a minute. The claim specifically mentions \"best actress in comedy\" being only won by Whoopi Goldberg in 1988. But looking at the table, I don't see any entry where she won the \"best actress - musical or comedy\" award in 1988.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg has several wins: in 1991 for best supporting actress (\"Ghost\"), and also a win in 2012? No, wait, no. Actually, from the table, she won in 1986 for best actress - drama for \"The Color Purple,\" not musical or comedy. She was also nominated for best actress - musical or comedy in 1993 for \"Sister Act.\" But I don't see her winning that category.\n\nLooking again, Angela Bassett won in 1994 for \"What's Love Got to Do with It.\" So the claim is incorrect because other actresses have won the award for best actress - musical or comedy. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Whoopi Goldberg is the only recipient of the Best Actress in Comedy award, specifically in 1988. However, examining the table shows that Angela Bassett won this award in 1994 and other actresses have also been recognized in the same category. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about an award table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"Between 2001 and 2011 there be 5 years where a black actress was not nominated for any award.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It lists various actors, awards they've been nominated for, the movies they were in, and whether they won or were just nominated. The claim is about the absence of nominations for black actresses over a specific time period.\n\nI need to focus on the years between 2001 and 2011. Let me look through the table to identify rows where this might apply. Each row has a year, actor name, award category, movie title, and result (either \"won\" or \"nominated\").\n\nSo, I'm specifically interested in black actresses who weren't nominated during these years. Wait, but actually, the claim is about years where no black actress was nominated at all. So I need to check for each year from 2001 to 2011 whether there were any black actresses who received nominations.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated in the Best Actress - Drama category.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress, and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n- 2010: Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress, and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n- 2011: Halle Berry was again nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n\nWait, but are these the only black actresses in that time frame? Let me check each year from 2001 to 2011:\n\nLooking at each row's year:\n- 1960, 62, 68, 69, 71, 73, 75, 81, 84, 86, 91, 93, 94, 97, 98, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nSo the years between 2001 and 2011 are: 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011. That's six years.\n\nNow, for each of these years, I need to check if there was at least one black actress nominated for any award. \n\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated.\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles were nominated.\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated.\n- 2010: Mo'Nique and Gabourey Sidibe were nominated.\n- 2011: Halle Berry was nominated.\n\nSo in each of these six years, there was at least one black actress who was either won or nominated for an award. Therefore, between 2001 and 2011, every single year had a black actress nominated for some award. \n\nWait, but the claim is that \"there be 5 years where a black actress was not nominated.\" If in each of those six years there were nominations, then how many years didn't have any? It seems like none, which would mean the claim is FALSE because it claims there are 5 such years.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"there be 5 year where a black actress was not nominated for any award.\" So perhaps it's referring to five separate instances across different years where in those specific years, no black actresses were nominated.\n\nGiven that between 2001 and 2011 every single year had at least one black actress nomination, there are zero such years. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states there were five such years when actually none existed.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm interpreting correctly. The term \"between 2001 and 2011\" could be exclusive or inclusive. From 2002 to 2011, which is ten years. But in each of those ten years, as per the table, there was at least one black actress nominated. So no year had zero nominations.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that there were five such years is FALSE because actually, none existed.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2002, \"column_name\": \"Halle Berry - Best Actress\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2003, \"column_name\": \"Queen Latifah - Supporting Actress\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2007, \"column_name\": \"Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"Viola Davis - Supporting Actress\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2010, \"column_name\": \"Mo'Nique and Gabourey Sidibe\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2011, \"column_name\": \"Halle Berry - Best Actress\"}\n]}",
