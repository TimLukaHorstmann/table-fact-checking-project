    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"laurent boutonnat do 8 remixes of the song throughout the year 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Laurent Boutonnat did 8 remixes of a song in the year 1995. So, I'm looking for all the remixes attributed to Laurent Boutonnat within the year 1995. \n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The relevant columns here are \"remixed by\" and \"year.\" Each row represents a different version or remix of a song, along with details like length, album, and the year it was released.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Album version: 1995, but no remixers listed.\n2. Single version: 1995, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat.\n3. No voice remix edit: 1995, remixed by both Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Chtenet.\n4. Extra large remix: 1995, remixed by both Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Chtenet.\n5. Distorded dance mix: 1995, same as above.\n6. New remix edit: 1995, same as above.\n7. Single dance mix: 1995, same as above.\n8. New remix edit (germany): 1995, same as above.\n9. German radio edit: 1995, same as above.\n10. Music video: 1995, no remixers listed.\n11. UK remix: 1996, remixed by Richard Dekkard, not Laurent Boutonnat.\n12. Live version (recorded in 1996): 1996, no remixers listed.\n13. JXL remix: 2003, Junkie XL, not relevant.\n14. Live version (recorded in 2006): 2006, no remixers listed.\n15. Live version (recorded in 2009): 2009, no remixers listed.\n\nNow, focusing on the year 1995 and Laurent Boutonnat as the remixer. From rows 2 to row 9, each of these is a 1995 release with remixes by both Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Chtenet. So that's rows 3 through 9: that's 7 remixes (since rows 3-9 inclusive is 7 entries). Wait, let me count:\n\nRow 2: single version\nRows 3-9: no voice, extra large, distorted dance, new edit, single dance mix, new edit (germany), german radio edit. That's 7 remixes by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995.\n\nWait, the claim says 8 remixes. So does that mean there are only 7, making the claim false? Or am I miscounting?\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n- Single version: row 2\n- No voice remix edit: row3\n- Extra large remix: row4\n- Distorded dance mix: row5\n- New remix edit: row6\n- Single dance mix: row7\n- New remix edit (germany): row8\n- German radio edit: row9\n\nWait, that's 8 entries in total. So rows 2 through 9 correspond to the single version and then 7 more, making it 8 remixes by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995.\n\nSo the claim says \"do 8 remixes,\" which matches these 8 entries. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed 8 remixes by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995 as listed in the table.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that each of these entries is a remix attributed solely to Laurent Boutonnat or in collaboration. Looking at rows 3-9, they list \"laurent boutonnat , bertrand chtenet\" as the remixer. So while he has co-remixers, the claim doesn't specify whether it's solo or collaborative. The term \"do\" might imply that he is the one doing them, possibly in collaboration. But the table shows that he is involved in each of those 8 remixes, so I think it's safe to consider all 8 as his contributions.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because there are 8 remixes by Laurent Boutonnat listed in 1995.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Laurent Boutonnat did 8 remixes of a song in 1995. The table shows 8 entries (single version through german radio edit) where Laurent Boutonnat was involved as a remixer, each in 1995. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with 7 of the remixes in the year 1995.\" So, the claim is saying that Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat have remixed seven tracks in the year 1995. My task is to check if this statement holds true based on the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several versions and remixes from 1995 onwards. Let me focus specifically on the year 1995 because the claim mentions that these remixes happened in that year. \n\nI'll go through each row of the 1995 data to count how many times both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat are listed as remixed by.\n\n1. **Album version**: This has no \"remixed by\" information, so it's not relevant.\n2. **Single version**: Only Laurent Boutonnat is mentioned here.\n3. **No voice remix edit**: Both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat are listed.\n4. **Extra large remix**: Both are mentioned again.\n5. **Distorded dance mix**: Both are present.\n6. **New remix edit**: Both names appear.\n7. **Single dance mix**: Both are here as well.\n8. **New remix edit (germany)**: Both are listed.\n9. **German radio edit**: Both names are included.\n10. **Music video**: No \"remixed by\" info, so it's not relevant.\n\nSo, counting the rows where both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat are mentioned together:\n\n- Rows 3,4,5,6,7,8,9: That's a total of seven entries (since they start from row index 3 up to row index 9, inclusive).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly seven remixes in the year 1995 where both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat worked together. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should also consider if any other versions might add more, but since we're only looking at 1995, those rows are all within that scope. There's no indication of any duplicates or additional entries beyond these seven.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by seven entries in the year 1995 where both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat are listed as remixed by.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"live version of the song be record in the year 2006 and 2009\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that there are live versions of the song recorded in both 2006 and 2009. So I need to look through the table to see if there are any entries for live versions in those years.\n\nLooking at the table columns: version type, length, album, remixed by, year. The relevant column for this claim is probably \"version\" or more specifically, whether it's a live version and the associated year.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for live versions. \n\nRow 0: album version, not live.\nRow 1: single version, not live.\nRows 2-9: mostly remixes and edits, not live versions except maybe the music video, but that's not a live version either.\nRow 10: UK remix, not live.\nRow 11: Live version recorded in 1996. So that's one live version, but not in 2006 or 2009.\nRows 12-13: More remixes and not live versions except row 14 which is live version (recorded in 2006). That's the first relevant one.\nRow 15: Live version recorded in 2009. So that's another relevant one.\n\nSo, looking at the table, there are indeed live versions recorded in both 2006 and 2009. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The \"year\" column is important for both 2006 and 2009 entries. Also, checking the row indices where \"live version\" is mentioned. Let me find those rows.\n\nRow index 11: live version (1996)\nRow index 14: live version (2006)\nRow index 15: live version (2009)\n\nWait, but the claim refers to both 2006 and 2009. So the relevant cells are the entries where the year is 2006 and 2009.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 2006: row 14, column \"year\" with value 2006.\n- For 2009: row 15, column \"year\" with value 2009.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should be these two cells. Their row indices are 14 and 15, and the column is \"year\".\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are those two entries in the year column for 2006 and 2009.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"2 remixes of the song were released in 1996 and 2003 by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL respectively.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has several columns: version, length, album, remixed by, and year. Each row represents a different version or remix of the song, with details about it.\n\nThe claim mentions two remixes released in 1996 and 2003. So I need to look for any versions released in those years. Specifically, we're looking for remixes done by Richard Dekkard (in 1996) and Junkie XL (in 2003).\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- In 1995, there are several remixes listed with various names like 'single version', 'no voice remix edit', etc., all remixed by Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Chtenet.\n- Then in 1996, I see two entries: 'uk remix' and 'live version (recorded in 1996)'. The 'uk remix' is done by Richard Dekkard in 1996. That's one of the remixes mentioned in the claim.\n- Next, in 2003, there's a 'jxl remix' by Junkie XL. That matches the second part of the claim about 2003.\n\nSo both required remixes are present in their respective years. The first is in 1996 by Richard Dekkard, and the second in 2003 by Junkie XL.\n\nNow, to verify this, I should look at the relevant cells. For each of these two remixes:\n\n1. 'uk remix' is row index 7, with \"remixed by\" as Richard Dekkard, year 1996.\n2. 'jxl remix' is row index 12, with \"remixed by\" as Junkie XL, year 2003.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by these two entries in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because both remixes mentioned are present in the table at their respective years and by the specified artists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

My goal is to find the relevant cells that correspond to the claim.\n\nStarting with the \"new remix edit,\" I need to locate its row in the table. Scanning through, I find it at row index 6 with a length of 4:25. That matches exactly what the claim states for one part\u2014both are supposed to be 4 minutes and 25 seconds.\n\nNext, looking for the \"single dance mix.\" I scan down until I find that at row index 7, it also has a length of 4:25. So both specified versions have the same duration as mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, checking if there are any discrepancies or additional info needed. The table shows that these two remixes each take 4 minutes and 25 seconds, which aligns perfectly with the claim.

Scanning through each row, I see that the version column has entries like 'album version,' 'single version,' etc., but I'm interested in the rows where Laurent Boutonnat is involved as a remixer.\n\nLooking at the remixer column for 1995:\n\n- Album version: -\n- Single version: Laurent Boutonnat\n- No voice remix edit: Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chtenet\n- Extra large remix: Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chtenet\n- Distorded dance mix: Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chteten\n- New remix edit: Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chtenen\n- Single dance mix: Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chteten\n- New remix edit (germany): Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chteten\n- German radio edit: Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chteten\n- Music video: -\n- UK remix: Richard Dekkard\n- Live version (recorded in 1996): -\n  \nWait, the claim is about 1995, so I should only consider rows from that year.

The claim is: \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with less than 7 of the remixes in the year 1995\". \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what this claim means. It seems like it's saying that Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat have been involved in remixing less than seven songs released in 1995.\n\nLooking at the table, let me go through each row for the year 1995. The rows are:\n\n1. album version: remixed by -\n2. single version: remixed by laurent boutonnat\n3. no voice remix edit: remixed by laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\n4. extra large remix: remixed by laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\n5. distorted dance mix: remixed by laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\n6. new remix edit: remixed by laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\n7. single dance mix: remixed by laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\n8. new remix edit (germany): remixed by laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\n9. german radio edit: remixed by laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\n\nSo, that's nine rows for 1995.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these have Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat listed as the remixers. Each row is a different version or mix, so each should be considered separately.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 2: single version has only laurent boutonnat.\n- Rows 3-9 (except row 2) have both laurent boutonnat and bertrand chtenet as remixers.\n\nSo, let's count how many times they are present together.\n\nRows 3 to 9: that's rows 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Wait, no, the table shows up to row 9 for 1995. Let me recount:\n\n1. album version\n2. single version\n3. no voice remix edit\n4. extra large remix\n5. distorted dance mix\n6. new remix edit\n7. single dance mix\n8. new remix edit (germany)\n9. german radio edit\n\nSo, rows 3 to 9 are all the ones with both names after row 2.\n\nSo from row 3 onward, that's rows 3,4,5,6,7,8,9: that's seven rows.\n\nWait, no: row 3 is no voice remix edit, then extra large (4), distorted (5), new remix (6), single dance mix (7), new remix Germany (8), german radio (9). So that's seven rows where both are listed.\n\nRow 2 has only laurent, so not both. Then, how many times are both present? Rows 3 to 9: that's 7 rows, each with both names.\n\nSo the count is 7 remixes in 1995 where both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat were involved.\n\nThe claim says \"less than 7\". But here we have exactly 7. So the claim would be FALSE because it's not less than 7, but equal to 7.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are rows 3 through 9 for 1995 where both remixers are listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"live version of the song be recorded before 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that there exists a live version of the song recorded before the year 2006. So I need to check if any row in the table has a \"live version\" and its corresponding year is less than 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: version, length, album, remixed by, and year. My focus should be on the \"version\" column since it describes the type of version, like 'live version'.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones have a live version:\n\n1. **album version**: Not a live version.\n2. **single version**: Not a live version.\n3. **no voice remix edit**: Not a live version.\n4. **extra large remix**: Not a live version.\n5. **distorded dance mix**: Not a live version.\n6. **new remix edit**: Not a live version.\n7. **single dance mix**: Not a live version.\n8. **new remix edit (germany)**: Not a live version.\n9. **german radio edit**: Not a live version.\n10. **music video**: Not a live version.\n11. **uk remix**: Remix, not live version.\n12. **live version (recorded in 1996)**: Yes, this is a live version and the year is 1996.\n13. **jxl remix**: Remix, not live version.\n14. **live version (recorded in 2006)**: Live version but in 2006.\n15. **live version (recorded in 2009)**: Live version but in 2009.\n\nSo the relevant rows are row indices 12 and 14. Specifically, row 12 has a live version from 1996, which is before 2006. Row 14's live version is from 2006, which doesn't meet the condition of being before 2006.\n\nThe claim says \"live version... recorded before 2006.\" Since there exists at least one live version (row 12) that was recorded in 1996, before 2006, the claim is TRUE. I need to highlight all rows with a live version where the year is less than 2006.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"live version (recorded in 1996)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"live version (recorded in 2006)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"2 remixes of the song were released after 2003 by richard dekkard and junkie xl respectively.\" So, we're looking for two remixes created by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL that came out after 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for any entries where the \"remixed by\" column mentions either Richard Dekkard or Junkie XL and ensure their respective remixes were released after 2003.\n\nStarting with Richard Dekkard: From the table, the only entry related to him is in row index 8 (\"uk remix\"), which has a year of 1996. That's before 2003, so that doesn't qualify.\n\nNext, Junkie XL: The only relevant row is row 12 (\"jxl remix\") from 2003. However, 2003 is the same as the cutoff year mentioned in the claim, but the claim specifies \"after 2003,\" meaning strictly after. Since 2003 isn't after 2003, this doesn't meet the criteria either.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"after 2003.\" So, any remixes released in 2003 or later? Or does \"after\" mean strictly after? If it's strictly after, then 2003 doesn't count. But if it's including 2003, then Junkie XL's 2003 remix would qualify.\n\nBut the phrasing is a bit unclear. The claim says \"released after 2003.\" Typically, \"after\" means not including the year itself. So 2003 wouldn't be considered as being released after that year. Therefore, neither remix meets the condition of being released after 2003.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The table's jxl remix is from 2003, and the claim wants remixes by Junkie XL released after 2003. So if \"after\" includes 2003, then it would count, but typically, \"after\" means later than that year.\n\nSince there are no remixes by Richard Dekkard after 2003 in the table, only the jxl remix is present, which is exactly in 2003. Therefore, the claim's assertion about two remixes isn't fully supported because neither meets the timing requirement.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires two remixes by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL released after 2003. Checking the table, only Junkie XL's 2003 remix exists, which doesn't satisfy \"after\" 2003. Thus, no supporting cells found.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the new remix edit and the single dance mix be both longer than 5 minute",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the new remix edit and the single dance mix be both longer than 5 minute.\" So, I should check each of these two entries in the table to see if their lengths are over five minutes.\n\nFirst, let me find where \"new remix edit\" is located in the table. Looking at the column headers, there's a column named \"version\", another for \"length\", and so on. The rows have various versions like album version, single version, etc. Scanning through, I see that one of the rows is labeled \"new remix edit\". Its row index isn't immediately clear, but looking at the table more carefully:\n\nThe rows are numbered from 0 onwards. Let's list them out:\n1. album version\n2. single version\n3. no voice remix edit\n4. extra large remix\n5. distorted dance mix\n6. new remix edit\n7. single dance mix\n8. new remix edit (germany)\n9. german radio edit\n10. music video\n11. uk remix\n12. live version (recorded in 1996)\n13. jxl remix\n14. live version (recorded in 2006)\n15. live version (recorded in 2009)\n\nWait, actually, the initial table starts with \"album version\" as row 0. So, each subsequent row increments by one. Therefore:\n- Row 6 is \"new remix edit\"\n- Row 7 is \"single dance mix\"\n\nLooking at their lengths:\n\nFor \"new remix edit (row 6)\", the length is 4:25. Now, wait\u2014does \"4:25\" mean 4 minutes and 25 seconds? Yes, it's a time format. So, 4:25 is less than 5 minutes.\n\nNext, for \"single dance mix (row 7)\", the length is also 4:25, which again is under five minutes.\n\nSo both of these remixes are under five minutes. Therefore, the claim that they're both longer than five minutes is false because neither exceeds five minutes.\n\nNow, I need to find their respective cells in the table. Each row has a \"version\" and \"length\" column. So for each of these two versions, I should include their row indices and column names as per the instructions.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For \"new remix edit\": row index 6, column_name \"length\"\n- For \"single dance mix\": row index 7, column_name \"length\"\n\nSo the JSON object will list these two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"length\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"length\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
