    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"China be the country where the Jiufotang Formation be located.\" Wait, actually, in the claim, it's written as \"jiufotang formation be locate\". Hmm, that seems like a typo, but I'll go with what's given. So, the main points are that China is the country and the Jiufotang Formation is located there.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: name, status, authors, unit, and location. The claim is specifically about the location of the Jiufotang Formation. So I should look for rows where the \"name\" column matches \"jiufotang formation\".\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n1. cathayopterus - location is China.\n2. caviramus - location is Switzerland.\n3. longchengpterus - location is China.\n4. muzquizopteryx - location is Mexico.\n5. yixianopterus - location is China.\n\nWait, but none of these are \"jiufotang formation\". So the table doesn't have an entry for Jiufotang Formation. That would mean that the claim is incorrect because there's no such row in the table supporting it. However, I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim has a typo and refers to another formation? But according to the user's instructions, I have to check exactly as given. The claim mentions \"jiufotang formation,\" but that specific name doesn't appear in any row of the table provided. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no data supporting it in the table.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: since none of the rows match the Jiufotang Formation, I don't need to highlight any. But wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the table? No, according to what's given, the Jiufotang Formation isn't listed, so no cells are relevant. However, looking at the claim again, it says \"China be the country where...\" which is correct because China does have formations like Yixian and Longcheng. But since the specific Formation mentioned in the claim isn't present, I think only if that Formation were there would it matter.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim links both China as the country and the Jiufotang Formation's location. Since Jiufotang isn't listed at all, the statement is false. So the answer should be FALSE with no relevant cells because the Formation isn't present.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"frey buchy stinnesbeck gonzalez stefano be the author locate in mexico.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see which ones are relevant. Each row has several columns: name, status, authors, unit, and location.\n\nI notice that the claim mentions an author's name and a location (mexico). So I need to find rows where the location is mexico because that's part of the claim. Let me check each row:\n\n1. cathayopterus - location is china.\n2. caviramus - switzerland.\n3. longchengpterus - china.\n4. muzquizopteryx - mexico. This seems relevant because its location is mexico, matching part of the claim.\n5. yixianopterus - china.\n\nSo only muzquizopteryx has a location of mexico. Now, I need to check if the authors include \"frey buchy stinnesbeck gonzalez stefano.\"\n\nLooking at the authors column for muzquizopteryx: It says \"frey buchy stinnesbeck gonzalez stefano.\" That's exactly the name mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by this row. The author is located in mexico as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the relevant cells in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"wang li duan cheng be locate in china\". So, it's stating that Wang Li Duan Cheng is located in China.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the row where the name is \"wang li duan cheng\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. cathayopterus\n2. caviramus\n3. longchengpterus\n4. muzquizopteryx\n5. yixianopterus\n\nWait, I don't see a row named \"wang li duan cheng\" in the table. Hmm, maybe it's under another column? Let me check each row.\n\nLooking at the 'name' column: The third row is \"longchengpterus\". Is that the same as Wang Li Duan Cheng? Maybe there's a discrepancy in how the names are written. The claim uses \"Wang Li Duan Cheng\", while the table might have it differently, like just \"wang li duan cheng\" without capitalization or possibly a different name.\n\nBut then I look at the 'authors' column for each row to see if there's an author match. For \"longchengpterus\", the authors are listed as \"wang li duan cheng\". That matches exactly with what the claim is stating: Wang Li Duan Cheng.\n\nSo, the relevant cells here would be the row where the name is \"longchengpterus\" and the 'authors' column, which has \"wang li duan cheng\".\n\nWait, but the claim is about the location. So I need to check if this person is located in China. The 'location' column for \"longchengpterus\" is \"china\", as seen in row 3.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met: Wang Li Duan Cheng is an author of longchengpterus, which is located in China. Hence, the claim that \"wang li duan cheng be locate in china\" is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the 'authors' and 'location' columns for \"longchengpterus\", confirming both the identity and location.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"authors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"l\u00fc ji yuan gao sun ji be the author locate in mexico.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. There's a column called \"authors\" and another called \"location\". For each row, I can check if the location matches Mexico.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. cathayopterus: authors are Wang Zhou, status is valid. Location is China.\n2. caviramus: authors are Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch, location Switzerland.\n3. longchengpterus: authors include Wang Li Duan Cheng, location Jiufotang formation, which I think is in China.\n4. muzquizopteryx: authors list includes Frey Buchy Stinnesbeck Gonzalez Stefano. Location is Austin group, and that's in Mexico.\n5. yixianopterus: authors are L\u00fc Ji Yuan Gao Sun Ji, location Yixian formation, which I believe is in China.\n\nThe claim mentions \"l\u00fc ji yuan gao sun ji\" as authors. Looking at the table, they're listed in the fourth row (index 4) under the \"authors\" column. The fifth row's location is China, not Mexico. \n\nSo, the claim says these authors are located in Mexico, but according to the table, their location is China. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the author is L\u00fc Ji Yuan Gao Sun Ji and their location is checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"wang li duan cheng , unit k\u00f6ssen formation be locate in china\". I need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant columns and rows in the table that might relate to the claim. The table has several columns: name, status, authors, unit, and location. The claim mentions \"wang li duan cheng\" which seems like an author's name. So I need to look for this author in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'authors' column, the fourth row (row_index 3) lists \"wang li duan cheng\". So that's relevant. Now, the claim says that the unit \"k\u00f6ssen formation\" is located in China. In the table, under the 'unit' column for the same row (row 3), it's listed as \"k\u00f6ssen formation\", and under 'location', it's \"switzerland\". So the location of the unit is Switzerland, not China.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says the unit is located in China, but according to the table, it's in Switzerland. That means part of the claim is incorrect. However, I should make sure there aren't any other relevant cells or possible interpretations.\n\nLooking again, the claim mentions \"wang li duan cheng\" as an author and refers to the location of the unit. So the relevant rows are row 3 for both the author and the unit. The 'location' column in row 3 is indeed Switzerland, so the unit isn't in China as the claim states.\n\nTherefore, since the location part of the claim is incorrect, the overall claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"authors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"China be the country where the Jiufotang Formation be located with Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch as author.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific elements: the location of the Jiufotang Formation and the authors associated with it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different species or entity with details like name, status, authors, unit, and location. My focus is on the \"location\" and \"authors\" columns for each relevant entry.\n\nI need to find the row where the location is Jiufotang Formation and see who the authors are. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. cathayopterus: location is China.\n2. caviramus: Switzerland.\n3. longchengpterus: Jiufotang Formation, authors include Wang Li Duan Cheng.\n4. muzquizopteryx: Mexico.\n5. yixianopterus: Yixian Formation.\n\nWait, the claim mentions Jiufotang Formation, so I'm looking for a row where \"location\" is Jiufotang Formation. From the table, only the third row (row_index 2) has location as Jiufotang Formation. The authors for that row are Wang Li Duan Cheng.\n\nNow, the claim says the country is China. Looking at that same row, the location is indeed Jiufotang Formation, which is in China because the fourth row, longchengpterus, is from China.\n\nWait, no, the third row's location is Jiufotang Formation, and according to the table, that's in China (from cathayopterus' location). So yes, the country is China.\n\nBut the claim also mentions Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch as authors. Wait, checking the table again: The third row has Wang Li Duan Cheng as authors, not Fr\u00f6bisch. There's no author listed as Fr\u00f6bisch in any row except caviramus, which is in Switzerland and not Jiufotang.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the table:\n\nLooking at each row:\n- cathayopterus: authors are Wang Zhou.\n- caviramus: authors are Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch.\n- longchengpterus: authors are Wang Li Duan Cheng.\n- muzquizopteryx: multiple authors, including Frey Buchy Stinnesbeck Gonzalez Stefano.\n- yixianopterus: authors are L\u00fc Ji Yuan Gao Sun Ji.\n\nSo, the claim says Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch is an author and that China is the country where Jiufotang Formation is located. \n\nBut in the table, caviramus (which is a different formation) has Fr\u00f6bisch as authors, and it's located in Switzerland. The Jiufotang Formation, however, is located in China, and its authors are Wang Li Duan Cheng, not Fr\u00f6bisch.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that Fr\u00f6bisch is the author for Jiufotang Formation, which isn't the case. The correct authors for that formation are different. So the claim has two issues: incorrect location (it's China) but wait, no, the location in the table for Jiufotang Formation is indeed China.\n\nWait, no, the location is correct. The claim says China is the country where Jiufotang Formation is located, which matches the third row. However, the authors are wrong because it should be Wang Li Duan Cheng, not Fr\u00f6bisch.\n\nSo the claim has a mistake regarding the authors but correctly states the country and formation location. Therefore, since there's an incorrect author mentioned, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly attributes the authors of the Jiufotang Formation to Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch when it should be Wang Li Duan Cheng. Despite this error in authors, the location is correct.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"authors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
