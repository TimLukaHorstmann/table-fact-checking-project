    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe table lists several basketball games with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The claim made is: \"box score be the type for all entry in the table include the game with a score of 103 - 101.\"\n\nHmm, I think there might be some confusion here. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"box score\" being the type for all entries, but looking at the table, each row has a \"score\" column and a \"box score\" column. The \"score\" is like the final points, while \"box score\" might be the actual detailed stats from the game. So, maybe the claim is saying that the \"box score\" column exists for all entries, not that it's being used in a specific way.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says to check if the box score is present for every entry, including those with the score of 103 - 101.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- For each row, I need to see if there's a value under \"box score.\" Let me go through each row.\n\n1. Row 0: date=22 october, home team=Townsville Crocodiles, score=103-101, away team=Sydney Spirit. Box score is listed as \"box score,\" and report is \"-\". So box score exists here.\n2. Row 1: date=22 october, home=Cairns Taipans, score=101-92, away=New Zealand Breakers. Box score exists.\n3. Row 2: 24 October, Wollongong Hawks vs Gold Coast Blaze. Score is 98-96, box score present.\n4. Row 3: Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats, score 93-104. Box score exists.\n5. Row 4: Gold Coast Blaze vs NZ Breakers, 113-116. Box score is there.\n6. Row 5: Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles, 110-97. Box score present.\n7. Row 6: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans, 94-65. Box score exists.\n8. Row 7: Sydney Spirit vs Wollongong Hawks, 99-86. Box score is there.\n\nSo for all eight entries in the table, the \"box score\" column has a value (either \"box score\" or \"-\"). But wait, some have \"-\", others just say \"box score.\" Does that matter? The instruction says to include the game with a score of 103-101. Looking at row 0, the score is 103-101, and the box score exists.\n\nBut what exactly is the claim asserting? It's a bit unclear. If it's saying that for all entries, including those with a 103-101 score, the \"box score\" column is present, then yes, because in row 0, which has 103-101, the box score is there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that every game in the table should have a box score entry. From my analysis, all entries do have either \"-\" or \"box score,\" but perhaps the \"-\" means it's not applicable or missing. However, looking at the data, even if it's \"-\", it's still present in the column.\n\nSo, considering that each row does have a value under the \"box score\" column, whether it's \"-\" or \"box score,\" then the claim would be TRUE because for every entry, including those with 103-101, the box score is present. But maybe if \"-\" means the box score isn't available, then perhaps it's not fully supported.\n\nWait, but in the table, the box score column has either \"-\" or \"box score.\" For example, row 0: \"box score,\" row1: \"box score,\" and so on. Maybe \"-\" indicates no box score was provided. But according to the data, all entries have a value, even if it's \"-\". So perhaps the claim is that for every entry, including those with 103-101, the box score column exists. In that case, since row0 has a box score, it's TRUE.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"-\" means no box score or just not reported. If \"-\" means no box score was available, then maybe some entries don't have it. But according to the data provided, every row has something in the \"box score\" column, so the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains a \"box score\" entry for each game, including the one with a 103-101 score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"box score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"box score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"all entry in the table be labled box score even the game where the away team be sydney spirit.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. It has columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. Each row represents a game with details filled in.\n\nThe claim is about labeling every entry as \"box score,\" including the specific game where the away team is Sydney Spirit. So I need to check two things: \n\n1. Does every cell in the table have the label \"box score\"?\n2. In particular, does the game where the away team is Sydney Spirit have the \"box score\" label?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- The first row: date 22 October, home team Townsville Crocodiles vs Sydney Spirit (away). The 'score' is 103 - 101. I'm checking if the 'box score' column has a value. It says \"box score,\" which seems to be a label. So that's correct.\n- Second row: same date, different teams. The box score is labeled correctly.\n- Third row: venue in Wollongong, away team Gold Coast Blaze vs home team Hawks. Box score is there.\n- Fourth row: Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats. Box score present.\n- Fifth row: Gold Coast Blaze as away team, New Zealand Breakers as home? Wait, no, the fifth row has Gold Coast Blaze as away and New Zealand Breakers as home? Wait, looking at the table, in the fifth row, it's \"gold coast blaze\" as the home team and \"new zealand breakers\" as away. So for this row, the away team is NZ Breakers, not Sydney Spirit.\n- Sixth row: Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles. Box score is there.\n- Seventh row: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans. Box score correct.\n- Eighth row: Sydney Spirit as home against Wollongong Hawks as away. This is the game where the away team is Sydney Spirit? Wait, no, the away team here is Wollongong Hawks. The away team in this context is Wollongong Hawks, so the claim is about when the away team is Sydney Spirit.\n\nWait, I think I need to find a row where the away team is Sydney Spirit. Looking through each row:\n\n- First row: away team is Sydney Spirit.\n- Second row: away team is New Zealand Breakers.\n- Third row: away team is Gold Coast Blaze.\n- Fourth row: away team is Perth Wildcats.\n- Fifth row: away team is New Zealand Breakers.\n- Sixth row: away team is Townsville Crocodiles.\n- Seventh row: away team is Cairns Taipans.\n- Eighth row: away team is Wollongong Hawks.\n\nSo only the first row has Sydney Spirit as the away team. So I need to check if in that row, the box score column is labeled \"box score.\"\n\nLooking at the first row's 'box score' column, it says \"box score.\" So that's correct.\n\nNow, checking all other cells: every row has a value in the 'box score' column. They are either numbers or just the text \"box score.\" Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, no. The table shows that each row has a date, home team, score (like 103 - 101), away team, venue, box score which is labeled as \"box score,\" and report which is empty.\n\nBut wait, in the first row: box score is written as \"box score.\" So it's the label. Similarly, other rows have \"box score\" in that column. So every cell in the 'box score' column has either a number or the text \"box score\"? Or perhaps it's always labeled \"box score\"?\n\nWait no, looking at the table:\n\nEach row has a date, home team, score (numbers), away team, venue (names), box score which is either numbers like 98-96 or just the word \"box score,\" and report which is empty.\n\nBut the claim says that all entries in the table should be labeled \"box score.\" Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted. Maybe it's not about the content but the label.\n\nWait, the 'box score' column in each row either contains a number or the text \"-\". But looking at the first row: box score is written as \"box score\", which seems to be the header. Wait no, the headers are \"date,\" \"home team,\" etc., and then the columns after that. So perhaps the 'box score' column's cells have either numbers or \"-\".\n\nWait, but in the table provided:\n\n- For each row, the box score is a number except for the first two rows where it says \"box score\". Wait no, looking again:\n\nThe markdown table shows that for each row, the 'score' column has numbers like 103 - 101. The 'box score' column for the first row is just written as \"box score\", and in other rows, it's a number or another entry.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again:\n\nThe table has columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report.\n\nIn each row, the 'box score' column is filled either with a number (like 98 - 96) or with \"box score\" as text? Or perhaps it's a header. Wait no, in markdown tables, the first row after headers is data rows. So in the first data row:\n\n| 22 october | townsville crocodiles | 103 - 101 | sydney spirit | ... | box score | - |\n\nSo 'box score' column has \"box score\" as its value, and report column has \"-\".\n\nWait no: looking at the markdown, each cell under 'box score' is either a number (like 98-96) or text. Wait, perhaps it's that in the first row, box score is \"box score\", but in others, it's numbers.\n\nBut the claim says all entries should be labeled \"box score,\" even for the game where away team is Sydney Spirit.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is whether every cell in the 'box score' column has the label \"box score\" regardless of the content. So if any row in 'box score' doesn't have \"box score\", then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nFirst row: box score is \"box score\"\nSecond row: box score is \"box score\"\nThird row: box score is 98 - 96\nFourth row: box score is 93 - 104\nFifth row: box score is 113 - 116\nSixth row: box score is 110 - 97\nSeventh row: box score is 94 - 65\nEighth row: box score is 99 - 86\n\nSo, in the first two rows, the 'box score' column has \"box score\" as the value. In the rest, it's a number.\n\nThus, not all entries are labeled \"box score\"\u2014only the first two have that label, and others have numbers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because not every entry in the 'box score' column is labeled as such; some contain numerical data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim means that each cell in the 'box score' column is either a number or the word \"box score,\" but the label should be consistent. But the problem says all entries are labeled \"box score,\" which isn't true because most have numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the statement is incorrect, so it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires evaluating whether every entry in the 'box score' column of a provided table is labeled as \"box score.\" Upon examining each row, it becomes evident that only the first two rows contain the label \"box score\" in their respective cells. The remaining rows have numerical values instead. Consequently, not all entries meet the condition specified.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is false because not every entry in the 'box score' column is labeled as \"box score.\"",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"gold coast blaze have their home game in the venue of gold coast convention centre.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any relevant information about the Gold Coast Blaze. Let's see... The table has several rows with different dates and teams.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- On 22 October: Home team is Townsville Crocodiles, away is Sydney Spirit.\n- On 25 October: There are two games involving Gold Coast Blaze. \n\nWait, let me check the third row: It's Wollongong Hawks vs Gold Coast Blaze. The venue is Win Entertainment Centre. So that game is not at Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n\nThen, the fourth row: Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats. Venue is Distinctive Homes Dome, so that's different.\n\nLooking further down, on 25 October, there's another game: Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles at State Netball and Hockey Centre.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the table. The fifth row has Gold Coast Blaze as the home team against New Zealand Breakers at Gold Coast Convention Centre. So that seems relevant because it's their home game in that venue.\n\nSo, according to this, on 25 October, Gold Coast Blaze played their home game at Gold Coast Convention Centre. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The claim talks about two things: the team (Gold Coast Blaze) and the venue (Gold Coast Convention Centre). So, in the table, I'll look for rows where the home team is Gold Coast Blaze and the venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 4: Home team is Adelaide 36ers, venue Distinctive Homes Dome. Not relevant.\n- Row 5: Home team is Melbourne Tigers, venue State Netball... No.\n- Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go row by row again.\n\nWait, the fifth row in the table (index 4) says:\n| 25 october | gold coast blaze      | 113 - 116 | new zealand breakers  | gold coast convention centre    | box score   | -        |\n\nSo that's Gold Coast Blaze as home team, venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre. So that's one relevant cell.\n\nIs there another? Let me check all rows where Gold Coast Blaze is the home team and the venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n\nWait, on 25 October, they have two games: row 5 (index 4) and another row I might have missed. Wait, no, looking back:\n\n- Row 0: Townsville Crocodiles at Townsville Entertainment Centre.\n- Row 1: Cairns Taipans at Cairns Convention Centre.\n- Row 2: Wollongong Hawks at Win Entertainment Centre.\n- Row 3: Adelaide 36ers at Distinctive Homes Dome.\n- Row 4: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers at Gold Coast Convention Centre. That's one relevant cell.\n- Then, row 5: Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles elsewhere.\n- Row 6: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans elsewhere.\n- Row 7: Sydney Spirit vs Wollongong Hawks elsewhere.\n\nWait, so only one game where Gold Coast Blaze is the home team at Gold Coast Convention Centre. So that's the relevant row and column for venue.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are when the home team is Gold Coast Blaze and the venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for rows where the home team is \"gold coast blaze\" and the venue is \"gold coast convention centre.\"\n\n- **Row 4 (index 4):** Home team is \"gold coast blaze,\" venue is \"gold coast convention centre.\"\n  \nThus, this single cell supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the match on 24 october at venue state netball and hockey centre with score of 113 - 116 have melbourne tiger as home team.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table to see if all the details align correctly.\n\nStarting with the date. The claim mentions October 24th, so I should look for any games on that date in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a match on October 24th involving the Wollongong Hawks and the Gold Coast Blaze at the Win Entertainment Centre. So the venue isn't the State Netball and Hockey Centre as stated in the claim. That might be an issue.\n\nNext, the score is 113 - 116. I need to find if any match on October 24th has this exact score. Looking again, Wollongong Hawks scored 98 against Gold Coast Blaze. No other matches on that date have a score close to 113-116, so this part doesn't fit either.\n\nThen, the home team is claimed to be Melbourne Tigers. Checking the table for October 24th, the home teams are only Wollongong Hawks and Gold Coast Blaze. The away teams are Sydney Spirit and Gold Coast Blaze. There's no mention of Melbourne Tigers on that date.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states a match on October 24 at State Netball and Hockey Centre with a score of 113-116, where Melbourne Tigers are the home team. But checking the table:\n\n1. Date: No game on October 24 is at State Netball and Hockey Centre.\n2. Score: None of the games on October 24 have a 113-116 score.\n3. Home Team: Melbourne Tigers aren't playing on that date as per the table.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim don't align with the provided data. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells for verification:\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant row is October 24, which is row index 2 (since the first row is October 22). The columns we need to check are date, venue, score, and home team.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include each of these four columns from that specific row. Wait, but in the instructions, it's a list where each entry has row_index and column_name. So for October 24 (row index 2), the columns are:\n\n- date: 22 october? Wait no, wait. Let me check the table again.\n\nWait, looking back at the markdown table:\n\nThe first row is 22 october, then another 22 october, then 24 october, so yes, October 24th is row index 2.\n\nIn that row, for October 24:\n\n- date: 24 october\n- home team: wollongong hawks\n- score: 98 - 96\n- away team: gold coast blaze\n- venue: win entertainment centre\n- box score: -\n- report: -\n\nSo the columns relevant are \"date\", \"home team\", \"score\", and \"venue\". Therefore, the relevant_cells would be each of these columns from row index 2.\n\nWait, but in the claim, the date is October 24th, so looking for that specific row. So yes, all four cells: date, home team, score, venue.\n\nSo the JSON should have each cell with their respective row and column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's details do not match the corresponding entries in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a basketball match is true or false by checking against the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the match on 25 october have gold coast blaze as home team with score of 93 - 104 at venue gold coast convention centre.\" So, I need to verify each part of this statement against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized in markdown format with several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. Each row represents a different match on various dates in October.\n\nThe claim specifies that on 25 October, there was a match where the home team was the Gold Coast Blaze. I should look for matches scheduled on 25 October where \"Gold Coast Blaze\" is listed as the home team. \n\nChecking the date column: \n- The first match is on 22 October.\n- Then 24 October and 25 October are next. Specifically, on 25 October, there are three matches:\n1. Adelaide 36ers vs. Perth Wildcats at Distinctive Homes Dome.\n2. Gold Coast Blaze vs. New Zealand Breakers at Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n3. Melbourne Tigers vs. Townsville Crocodiles at State Netball and Hockey Centre.\n\nSo the second match on 25 October is indeed the Gold Coast Blaze as the home team against the New Zealand Breakers. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the score: the claim says 93 - 104. Looking at the table, for that specific match (Gold Coast Blaze vs. New Zealand Breakers), the score is listed as 113 - 116. Wait, that doesn't match 93 - 104. Hmm, there seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which row corresponds to the Gold Coast Blaze at Gold Coast Convention Centre. Let me double-check each row for 25 October:\n\n- First row: Adelaide 36ers vs. Perth Wildcats, venue is Distinctive Homes Dome.\n- Second row: Gold Coast Blaze vs. New Zealand Breakers, venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre. The score here is 113 - 116.\n- Third row: Melbourne Tigers vs. Townsville Crocodiles, venue is State Netball and Hockey Centre.\n\nSo the match where Gold Coast Blaze is the home team on 25 October has a score of 113 - 116, not 93 - 104 as stated in the claim. That means the score part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there's another match on 25 October where Gold Coast Blaze might have scored 93-104. Looking through all rows for 25 October, the only other match involving Gold Coast Blaze is the second one with a different score. So no, that specific score doesn't exist in the table.\n\nAnother thing to consider: maybe the claim confused two different matches on the same date? But the venue is specified as Gold Coast Convention Centre, which only applies to the second match I mentioned earlier. The first match at Distinctive Homes Dome is a different venue and has a different score (93-104 vs. 113-116). Wait, no, in the table, the Adelaide 36ers game on 25 October shows a score of 93 - 104 against Perth Wildcats. That's correct.\n\nSo, wait: On 25 October, two matches were played at different venues:\n1. At Distinctive Homes Dome: Adelaide 36ers (home) vs. Perth Wildcats with a score of 93-104.\n2. At Gold Coast Convention Centre: Gold Coast Blaze (home) vs. New Zealand Breakers with a score of 113-116.\n\nTherefore, the claim mentions \"Gold Coast Blaze as home team\" but attributes a different score (93-104), which doesn't align with their actual match. So the claim is incorrect in the score part.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the columns. Let me make sure: The columns are date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report. So for each row, home team's score is listed first, then away team's.\n\nLooking at the second match on 25 October: Gold Coast Blaze (home) vs. New Zealand Breakers (away). Score is 113 - 116. So that's correct. The claim says 93-104, which must be from another match, not involving Gold Coast Blaze as home.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states the score for that particular game. Therefore, the entire claim is false because either the date or the score doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, the date does match: 25 October is correct. But the score is wrong. So the claim is partially correct in terms of date and venue, but incorrect in the score.\n\nSo overall, since one part of the claim is incorrect, the entire statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on 25 October, the Gold Coast Blaze had a home game with a score of 93 - 104 at the Gold Coast Convention Centre. Checking the table, the Gold Coast Blaze's match on 25 October was against the New Zealand Breakers with a score of 113 - 116, not 93 - 104. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"when the gold coast be the away team the score be 101 - 92.\" So, I'm looking for instances where the home team is not Gold Coast and the away team is Gold Coast with a score of 101-92.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table one by one to check this condition.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Date: 22 October\n- Home Team: Townsville Crocodiles\n- Away Team: Sydney Spirit\n- Score: 103 - 101\nNo, not Gold Coast away, so move on.\n\nSecond row:\n- Date: 22 October\n- Home Team: Cairns Taipans\n- Away Team: New Zealand Breakers\nScore is 101-92. But the away team here isn't Gold Coast, it's New Zealand Breakers. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThird row:\n- Date: 24 October\n- Home Team: Wollongong Hawks\n- Away Team: Gold Coast Blaze\nScore is 98-96. Not 101-92, so no match.\n\nFourth row:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home Team: Adelaide 36ers\n- Away Team: Perth Wildcats\nNot related to Gold Coast as away, skip.\n\nFifth row:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home Team: Gold Coast Blaze\n- Away Team: New Zealand Breakers\nScore is 113-116. Not the target score of 101-92, so nope.\n\nSixth row:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home Team: Melbourne Tigers\n- Away Team: Townsville Crocodiles\nNot relevant, skip.\n\nSeventh row:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home Team: South Dragons\n- Away Team: Cairns Taipans\nNo match, skip.\n\nEighth row:\n- Date: 26 October\n- Home Team: Sydney Spirit\n- Away Team: Wollongong Hawks\nScore is 99-86. Not the target.\n\nSo after going through all rows, I didn't find any instance where Gold Coast is away with a score of 101-92. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each row for when \"Gold Coast\" is listed as the away team and if their score matches \"101 - 92\". After reviewing all rows, no such instance exists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully reading both the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the match on 26 october have box score type of box score with south dragon as home team and score of 103 - 101.\"\n\nI need to break this down into parts to check against the table.\n\n1. **Date**: The claim specifies \"26 october.\" Looking at the table, I should find all matches that occurred on the 26th of October.\n\n2. **Box Score Type**: It mentions \"box score type,\" but in the table, each row has a 'report' column. However, the term used is \"box score\" and it's one of the columns. Wait, actually, looking at the columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report.\n\nSo, the relevant columns for the claim are:\n- date\n- home team\n- away team\n- score\n- box score (but in the table, it's just a cell named 'box score' without specific types. Maybe each entry is unique, so I can check if the exact wording matches.)\n\nWait, no, the 'box score' column has numerical values like \"box score\" but perhaps the claim is referring to the content of that column being equal to 103 - 101.\n\nBut actually, in the table, the 'score' column is labeled as such. The 'box score' seems to be a separate column, maybe indicating the official box score number? Or perhaps it's redundant. Wait, looking at the table:\n\nFor example, the first row has:\n- date: 22 october\n- home team: townsville crocodiles\n- score: 103 - 101\n- away team: sydney spirit\n- venue: townsville entertainment centre\n- box score: (empty)\n- report: -\n\nWait, actually, in some rows, the 'box score' column has \"box score\" as its value. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it's a placeholder or not relevant.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is referring to the 'score' column rather than the 'box score' column. Let me check:\n\nIn the table, each row has:\n- date\n- home team\n- score (e.g., 103 - 101)\n- away team\n- venue\n- box score (with sometimes \"box score\" as value)\n- report\n\nSo, for the claim, it's about the match on 26th October. Let me look at that specific row.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: 22 october... no.\nRow 1: 22 october... no.\nRow 2: 24 october... no.\nRow 3: 25 october... no.\nRow 4: 25 october... no.\nRow 5: 25 october... no.\nRow 6: south dragons vs cairns taipans, date 26 october. So, row index 6.\n\nWait, let me count the rows properly:\n\n1. 22 october\n2. 22 october\n3. 24 october\n4. 25 october\n5. 25 october\n6. 25 october\n7. 26 october\n\nYes, row index 6 is the one on 26 October.\n\nIn that row:\n- home team: south dragons\n- away team: cairns taipans\n- score: 94 - 65\n- box score: (empty)\n- report: -\n\nSo, according to this, the home team is south dragons with a score of 94 - 65 against cairns taipans.\n\nNow, the claim says that on 26 October, there was a match where the home team is south dragon, and the score is 103 - 101. But in the table, the score for that game is 94-65, not 103-101.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion about the score being 103-101 is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, checking the box score column: it's empty. The claim mentions \"box score type,\" but perhaps it's referring to the numerical value in the 'score' column. However, since the score doesn't match, the claim is false regardless of the box score column.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe date matches (26 October). The home team is south dragons. But the score is 94-65, not 103-101. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
