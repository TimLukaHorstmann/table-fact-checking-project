    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"From 1992 to 2012, no Croatian entry into the Academy Award received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what needs to be checked. We have a table that lists each year from 1992 (65th ceremony) up to 2012 (85th ceremony). For each year, it provides the film title used in nomination, the original title, director(s), and whether they were not nominated.\n\nThe claim is stating that during this period, no Croatian film received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. So I need to check if any of these films from Croatia were actually nominated between 1992 and 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific year. The column \"result\" shows whether they were not nominated. However, the claim is about receiving a nomination, so even if the result was \"not nominated,\" we need to confirm that no film in this period was actually nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nWait, but the table's \"result\" might just indicate if it wasn't nominated at all, which could be because they didn't get any award or weren't even submitted. The claim is about not receiving a nomination, so perhaps the table's data supports that no films from Croatia were nominated in this period.\n\nBut I need to check each relevant row to see if any film was actually nominated. Wait, but the \"result\" column just says \"not nominated,\" which might mean they didn't win or get shortlisted. The claim is about not receiving a nomination at all.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim is saying that during this period, no Croatian entry into the Academy Awards received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. So we need to check if any Croatian film was either submitted and got nominated or just submitted but not nominated.\n\nLooking through each row from 1992 (65th) to 2012 (85th), I need to find if any film had a result that includes being nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nWait, the \"result\" column only says \"not nominated.\" So perhaps none of them were even nominated. But maybe some films were submitted but not nominated, and others weren't submitted at all. The claim is about no entry into the Academy Awards receiving a nomination, so it's about being submitted and getting a nomination.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row shows that the film was submitted (since they are listed with their titles and directors), but the result is \"not nominated.\" So does this mean that for all these films, they were submitted but not shortlisted or did not win? Or does it mean they weren't even entered?\n\nWait, the term \"result\" here might be ambiguous. If a film was submitted (entered) but didn't get a nomination, then it's not nominated. But if it wasn't entered at all, perhaps it's not in the table.\n\nSo, to confirm the claim, I need to check whether any Croatian film between 1992-2012 was actually entered for consideration and thus eligible for nomination, which would mean they got a nomination or not. Since all of them have \"not nominated,\" maybe none were even shortlisted.\n\nBut wait, perhaps some films from Croatia might have been submitted but didn't get a nomination, while others weren't submitted at all. So the claim is specifically about entries (films that were submitted) not receiving a nomination.\n\nWait, the term \"entry into the Academy Award\" refers to submitting a film for consideration. So if no film was submitted by Croatia in this period, then there's no entry. But looking at the table, each year from 1992-2012 has a Croatian entry (since all rows have 'not nominated'). So perhaps all these films were submitted but didn't get a nomination.\n\nThus, the claim is that none of them received a nomination. Since they were all \"not nominated,\" maybe that's true.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. The claim says \"no croatian entry into the academy award receive a nomination.\" So it's stating that none of the entries were nominated. If all entries in this period (1992-2012) are marked as not nominated, then the claim is correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the last row for 2013, which is outside the given period, the result is \"tbd,\" meaning to be determined. So up to 2012, all Croatian films were not nominated.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because none of the entries from Croatia between 1992 and 2012 received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim that no Croatian film received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film between 1992 and 2012, we examine each relevant row in the table. Each entry lists a Croatian film that was submitted but not nominated. Since all films in this period are marked as \"not nominated,\" there were indeed no nominations. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"only 2 of the croatian film enter into the academy award have the same title in english and croatian : libertas and armin.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It's a list of films that were nominated for Academy Awards (or Oscars) from 1992 to 2013. Each row has details like the year, film titles used in nomination, original title, director(s), and whether it was nominated or not.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Croatian films where both the English title and the Croatian title are the same. The example given is \"libertas\" and \"armin.\" So, I need to check if there are only two such films in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on the column 'film title used in nomination' because that's what the claim refers to. For each film, compare the English title (as given) with the original Croatian title. If they match exactly, that counts as a film where both titles are the same.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 1992: \"story from croatia\" vs \"pri\u010da iz hrvatske\" \u2013 Different titles.\n2. 1993: \"countess dora\" vs \"kontesa dora\" \u2013 Different (but similar, but not exact).\n3. 1994: \"vukovar : the way home\" vs \"vukovar se vra\u0107a ku\u0107i\" \u2013 Different.\n4. 1995: \"washed out\" vs \"isprani\" \u2013 Different.\n5. 1996: \"nausikaya\" vs \"nausikaja\" \u2013 Different (spelling difference).\n6. 1997: \"lapitch the little shoemaker\" vs \"\u010dudnovate zgode \u0161egrta hlapi\u0107a\" \u2013 Different titles entirely.\n7. 1998: \"transatlantic\" vs \"transatlantik\" \u2013 Different, but similar endings.\n8. 1999: \"red dust\" vs \"crvena pra\u0161ina\" \u2013 Different.\n9. 2000: \"marshall tito 's spirit\" vs \"mar\u0161al\" \u2013 Different titles.\n10. 2001: \"queen of the night\" vs \"kraljica no\u0107i\" \u2013 Different.\n11. 2002: \"fine dead girls\" vs \"fine mrtve djevojke\" \u2013 Different, but similar in meaning.\n12. 2003: \"witnesses\" vs \"svjedoci\" \u2013 Different titles.\n13. 2004: \"long dark night\" vs \"duga mra\u010dna no\u0107\" \u2013 Different.\n14. 2005: \"a wonderful night in split\" vs \"ta divna splitska no\u0107\" \u2013 Different, but similar meaning.\n15. 2006: \"libertas\" vs \"libertas\" \u2013 Same! So this is one film where both titles match.\n16. 2007: \"armin\" vs \"armin\" \u2013 Another match, so that's the second one.\n17. 2008: \"no one 's son\" vs \"ni\u010diji sin\" \u2013 Different titles.\n18. 2009: \"donkey\" vs \"kenjac\" \u2013 Different.\n19. 2010: \"the blacks\" vs \"crnci\" \u2013 Different, but similar meaning.\n20. 2011: \"72 days\" vs \"sedamdeset i dva dana\" \u2013 Different titles.\n21. 2012: \"cannibal vegetarian\" vs \"ljudo\u017eder vegetarijanac\" \u2013 Different, though similar in concept.\n22. 2013: \"halima 's path\" vs \"halimin put\" \u2013 Different.\n\nFrom this, I see only two films where the English title and Croatian title are exactly the same: Libertas (2006) and Armin (2007). That matches the claim's statement that only these two exist. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also identify which cells are relevant. The columns to look at are 'film title used in nomination' for both languages. So the relevant rows are 15 and 16 (assuming row indexing starts at 0, so 2006 is row index 14 and 2007 is row 15). Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the table, the first row is 1992 as row 0, then each subsequent year increments by one. So 2006 would be row 14 (since 2006-1992=14) and 2007 is row 15.\n\nEach relevant cell should have \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" The column in question is 'film title used in nomination.'\n\nSo the relevant cells are for row indices 14 and 15, both under 'film title used in nomination.'\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are exactly two films where the English and Croatian titles match: Libertas (2006) and Armin (2007). The relevant cells are at rows 14 and 15 under the 'film title used in nomination' column.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{TRUE}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"Branko Schmidt and Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107 be the most prolific director, have 3 Academy Award - entered film each.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim is saying that both Branko Schmidt and Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107 are directors who have produced three films each that were Oscar-nominated (entered for an Academy Award). So I need to check the table to see how many times each of them directed a film that was nominated.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, film title used in nomination, original title, director(s), and result. My focus is on the directors' names, specifically Branko Schmidt and Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107.\n\nLet me go through each row to see if these directors are involved:\n\nStarting from 1992 (65th) onwards:\n\n- 1995 (68th): Director is Zrinko Ogresta.\n- 1998 (71st): Director is Mladen Juran.\n- 1999 (72nd): Director is Zrinko Ogresta.\n- 2004 (77th): Director is Antun Vrdoljak.\n- 2005 (78th): Director is Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107.\n- 2006 (79th): Director is Veljko Bulaji\u0107.\n- 2007 (80th): Director is Ognjen Svili\u010di\u0107.\n- 2008 (81st): Director is Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107.\n- 2009 (82nd): Director is Antonio Nui\u0107.\n- 2010 (83rd): Directors are Goran Devi\u0107 & Zvonimir Juri\u0107.\n- 2012 (85th): Director is Branko Schmidt.\n\nNow, let's count the number of films each director has directed that were Oscar-nominated:\n\nFor Branko Schmidt:\nLooking at the table, he directed in 1995 and 2012. So that's two films.\n\nArsen Anton Ostoji\u0107:\nHe directed in 2005 and 2008. That's also two films.\n\nWait, the claim says they are \"the most prolific director[s]\" and each have three Academy Award entries. But according to the table, each has only directed two Oscar-nominated films. There's no row where Branko Schmidt or Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107 directed a third film that was nominated.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the result column, none of their films were actually Oscar winners; they're all \"not nominated.\"\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because both directors have only directed two Oscar-nominated films each, not three. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2012, \"column_name\": \"director\"}, {\"row_index\": 2008, \"column_name\": \"director\"}, {\"row_index\": 2005, \"column_name\": \"director\"}]}",

Let me parse it.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and see which entries are relevant. The table has columns like year, film title used in nomination, original title, director(s), and result.\n\nThe claim mentions \"crnci (the blacks)\" as the film, so I should find that row. Let me scan through the 'film title used in nomination' column:\n\n1992: story from croatia\n1993: countess dora\n...\n2010: the blacks\n\nYes, there's an entry for \"the blacks\" in 2011 (84th), which is co-directed by Goran Devi\u0107 and Zvonimir Juri\u0107. The result for that entry is \"not nominated.\"\n\nNow, the claim says it's the only Croatian film with a co-director entering the Academy Award. So I need to check other films from Croatia in the table to see if any others have co-directors who were Oscar-nominated.\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n1992: Directed by Krsto Papi\u0107 alone.\n1993: Zvonimir Berkovi\u0107 alone.\n...\n2006: Veljko Bulaji\u0107 alone.\n...\n2011: Co-directed by Goran Devi\u0107 and Zvonimir Juri\u0107, but result is not nominated.\n\nSo the claim says it's the only one.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about Branko Schmidt's first and most recent Academy Award entry being separated by 18 years is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table where \"director (s)\" includes Branko Schmidt. Let me scan through the 'director' column:\n\n- 1994: Branko Schmidt\n- 2002: Branko Schmidt\n- 2012: Branko Schmidt\n\nWait, no, looking again. The 1994 row is directed by Branko Schmidt, the 2009 row has Antonio Nui\u0107, and in 2012, it's also Branko Schmidt.\n\nNow, the claim says his first entry was separated by 18 years from his most recent. So I need to identify when he first entered with a film and when he last entered.\n\nFrom the table:\n- He directed \"vukovar se vra\u0107a ku\u0107i\" in 1994 (ceremony 67th).\n- His next films are spread out, but looking at the latest entry, it's 2012 (85th ceremony), but actually, I see another entry: in 2009 he directed \"kenjac,\" which is listed as \"donkey.\" Wait, no, the 2009 row is for \"donkey\" with director Antonio Nui\u0107. Then in 2012, it's Branko Schmidt again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list out all rows where Branko Schmidt is the director:\n\n- 1994: Branko Schmidt (67th)\n- 2009: Not Branko\n- 2012: Branko Schmidt (85th)\n\nWait no, looking back, in 1994 it's 67th, then later in 2009, \"kenjac\" directed by Antonio Nui\u0107. Then in 2012, \"ljudo\u017eder vegetarijanac\" directed by Branko Schmidt at the 85th ceremony.\n\nSo his first entry is 1994 (row 3), and his most recent is 2012 (row 12). Let's calculate the difference between 2012 and 1994. That's 18 years exactly because 2012 - 1994 = 18.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, row indices start from 0:\n\nRow 3: 1994 (67th)\nRow 12: 2008? No, wait, rows are numbered as per the markdown:\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a year. Let me check the actual years:\n\n- 1992 (65th)...\n- 1993 (66th)...\n- ...\n- 2012 is 85th ceremony.\n\nSo from 67th to 85th is an increase of 18 years because 85 - 67 = 18.\n\nWait, but the first entry for Branko Schmidt is in row 3, which is 1994 (67th). His most recent entry is in row 12, which is 2012 (85th). So from 67 to 85 is 18 years. Therefore, the two entries are separated by exactly 18 years.\n\nSo the claim says his first and most recent Academy Award entries are separated by 18 years. Looking at the table, that seems accurate because his first was in 1994, and the next was in 2012, which is a gap of 18 years.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other entry for him between 1994 and 2012. Scanning the table again:\n\nRows after 3:\n- 1995: Zrinko Ogresta\n- 1996: Vicko Rui\u0107\n- ...\n- 2008: Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107\n- 2009: Antonio Nui\u0107\n- 2010: Goran Devi\u0107 & Zvonimir Juri\u0107\n- 2011: Danilo \u0160erbed\u017eija\n- 2012: Branko Schmidt\n\nSo no, there are no other Branko Schmidt entries between 1994 and 2012.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"no coratian film enter into the academy award have the same title in engligh and croatian.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's stating that no Croatian films entered the Academy Awards with titles that are the same in both English and Croatian. So, essentially, it's saying that all Croatian film entries at the Oscars have different English and Croatian titles.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various years, film titles used in nominations, original titles, directors, and whether they were nominated. My task is to check if any of these films are Croatian and have the same title in both languages as claimed by the user.\n\nStarting from 1992 (65th ceremony) to 2013 (86th ceremony), I need to go through each row where the original title seems to be Croatian. Wait, actually, the \"original title\" column is in Croatian, so that's a good starting point. The claim mentions \"Croatian film,\" which probably refers to films with Croatian origins or titles.\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n1992: Original title is \"pri\u010da iz hrvatske.\" So, it's in Croatian. The nominated title is \"story from croatia.\" Are these the same? Let me check. \"Pri\u010da iz hrvatske\" translates to \"A Story from Croatia,\" right? But the nominated title is \"Story from Croatia.\" Wait, actually, they are almost the same except for capitalization and perhaps wording. But in titles, sometimes capitalization doesn't matter much, but maybe \"pri\u010da\" is singular while \"story\" is plural. So, probably not the exact same title.\n\n1993: Original title is \"kontesa dora,\" which translates to \"Countess Dora.\" The nominated title is \"countess dora.\" So, exactly the same in both languages? Wait, \"Countess Dora\" vs. \"Countess Dora\"\u2014same spelling and case. Hmm, maybe that's a match.\n\nBut wait, the claim says no Croatian film has the same title in English and Croatian. If this 1993 entry has the same title, then the claim would be false because at least one exists where it does have the same title. So, if I'm correct here, the answer would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. \"Countess Dora\" is the original title in Croatian, and the film used in nomination is also \"countess dora.\" So, it's the same. Therefore, there exists at least one Croatian film that entered the Academy Awards with the same English and Croatian title.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it states that no such films exist when actually at least one does (1993).\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that no Croatian films have the same English and Croatian titles when entering the Academy Awards. However, in 1993, \"Countess Dora\" was nominated with both the original title and the film used in nomination having identical English and Croatian titles.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"original title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be no croatian fils with co-director enter into the academy award.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's stating that there are no Croatian films with a co-director who entered the Academy Awards (Oscars). So, I should look for any entries in the table where a Croatian film was nominated and had a co-director, and then check if that co-director entered the Oscars.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year of the ceremony, the film title used in nomination, the original title, the director(s), and whether it was nominated. The last column is \"result,\" which indicates whether they were not nominated.\n\nI need to focus on films where the director has co-directors, specifically if any of them entered the Academy Awards. So, I should scan each row for directors who are Croatian and see if their name appears in the \"director(s)\" column alongside another director. Then, check if either of those directors was a member of the Academy.\n\nStarting from 1992:\n\n- 1992: Director is Krsto Papi\u0107 alone.\n- 1993: Zvonimir Berkovi\u0107 alone.\n- 1994: Branko Schmidt alone.\n- 1995: Zrinko Ogresta alone.\n- 1996: Vicko Rui\u0107 alone.\n- 1997: Milan Bla\u017eekovi\u0107 alone.\n- 1998: Mladen Juran alone.\n- 1999: Zrinko Ogresta alone.\n- 2000: Vinko Bre\u0161an alone.\n- 2001: Branko Schmidt alone.\n- 2002: Dalibor Matani\u0107 alone.\n- 2003: Vinko Bre\u0161an alone.\n- 2004: Antun Vrdoljak alone.\n- 2005: Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107 alone.\n- 2006: Veljko Bulaji\u0107 alone.\n- 2007: Ognjen Svili\u010di\u0107 alone.\n- 2008: Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107 alone.\n- 2009: Antonio Nui\u0107 alone.\n- 2010: Goran Devi\u0107 and Zvonimir Juri\u0107. Both are Croatian directors.\n- 2011: Danilo \u0160erbed\u017eija alone.\n- 2012: Branko Schmidt alone.\n- 2013: Arsen Anton Ostoji\u0107 alone.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"fil[s] with co-director,\" so looking for multiple directors in a single row. So only 2010 has two directors: Goran Devi\u0107 and Zvonimir Juri\u0107. Both are Croatian, which fits the criteria of having co-directors.\n\nNow, does any of these directors enter into the Academy Awards? The claim says \"enter into the academy award,\" but I think it's about being a member of the Academy. So, if either of them is an Academy member, then the claim would be false because there exists such a film with a co-director who might have entered.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't provide information on whether these directors are members of the Academy. However, from general knowledge, some Croatian directors like Branko Schmidt and Antun Vrdoljak have been involved in Oscar-winning films or projects. For example, Antun Vrdoljak was part of the team that won an Oscar for \"When We Were Young,\" I believe. Similarly, Branko Schmidt might be associated with Oscar-nominated works.\n\nGiven this, the 2010 film has two Croatian directors: Goran Devi\u0107 and Zvonimir Juri\u0107. If either of them is a member of the Academy, then the claim is false because there exists such a film with co-directors who entered the Oscars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to co-directing an Oscar-nominated film, but in this case, the films listed are all not nominated except for 2013 which is marked as TBD. So, none of them have been Oscar winners or nominees except possibly if they were part of other projects not listed here.\n\nBut without specific data on whether these directors are Academy members, it's hard to be certain. However, considering that some Croatian directors have been involved in Oscar-winning films, I think the claim is false because such co-directors do exist.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests there are no Croatian films with co-directors who entered the Academy Awards. However, examining the table, the 2010 film has two Croatian directors: Goran Devi\u0107 and Zvonimir Juri\u0107. Given that some Croatian directors have been involved in Oscar-winning projects, this indicates the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2010,\n      \"column_name\": \"director(s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"director krsto papi\u0107 have the most academy award - entered film , at 4.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find all occurrences where Krsto Papi\u0107 was involved as a director. According to the table:\n\n- In the year 1992 (65th ceremony), Krsto Papi\u0107 directed \"pri\u010da iz hrvatske,\" which was nominated but not selected.\n- In 1995 (68th), he directed \"isprani,\" also not nominated.\n- In 2001 (74th), he worked on \"kraljica no\u0107i.\"\n- In 2004 (77th), he directed \"duga mra\u010dna no\u0107.\"\n- In 2006 (79th), he was involved with \"libertas.\"\n- In 2008 (81st), he directed \"ni\u010diji sin.\"\n- In 2012 (85th), he worked on \"ljudo\u017eder vegetarijanac.\"\n\nLooking at the claim, it's about Krsto Papi\u0107 having the most Academy Award entries. Each film entry in the table represents a separate Oscar submission. The claim states that he has four such entries.\n\nFrom the table, I can count how many times Krsto Papi\u0107 was a director:\n\n1. 1992 (65th)\n2. 1995 (68th)\n3. 2001 (74th)\n4. 2004 (77th)\n5. 2006 (79th)\n6. 2008 (81st)\n7. 2012 (85th)\n\nWait, that's seven entries. The claim says four, but the table shows more. Did I miscount? Let me check each row where Papi\u0107 is listed:\n\n- 1992: yes\n- 1995: yes\n- 2001: yes\n- 2004: yes\n- 2006: yes\n- 2008: yes\n- 2012: yes\n\nThat's seven. So the claim might be incorrect as it says four, but according to the table, there are more than four entries.\n\nHowever, I should also consider whether each entry was actually submitted for consideration. In Oscar submissions, sometimes films are invited without being nominated, which is the case here as all Krsto Papi\u0107's films were not nominated.\n\nBut regardless of whether they were nominated, the count of Academy Award entries would be seven based on this table. The claim says four, but according to the data, it's more than that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check if there are only four because maybe some rows have multiple directors or maybe Krsto Papi\u0107 is listed in other columns. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the \"director (s)\" column:\n\n- 1992: krsto papi\u0107\n- 1995: zrinko ogresta (different director)\nWait, no, 1995's director is zrinko ogresta, not Papi\u0107.\nSo perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n1. 1992: Krsto Papi\u0107 - yes\n2. 1993: different director\n3. 1994: different\n4. 1995: different (ogresta)\n5. 1996: different\n6. 1997: different\n7. 1998: different\n8. 1999: different\n9. 2000: different\n10. 2001: Krsto Papi\u0107 - yes\n11. 2002: different\n12. 2003: different\n13. 2004: Krsto Papi\u0107 - yes\n14. 2005: different\n15. 2006: Krsto Papi\u0107 - yes\n16. 2007: different\n17. 2008: Krsto Papi\u0107 - yes\n18. 2009: different\n19. 2010: different (two directors)\n20. 2011: different\n21. 2012: Krsto Papi\u0107 - yes\n\nWait, so from 1992 to 2012, he has entries at rows 0, 10, 13, and 17. Wait, that would be four instances.\n\nWait, maybe I was overcounting before. Let me recount:\n\nLooking for Krsto Papi\u0107 in the \"director (s)\" column:\n\n- Row 0: yes\n- Row 2: no\n- Row 3: no\n- Row 10: yes\n- Row 13: yes\n- Row 17: yes\n- Row 21: yes\n\nWait, that's five instances. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should count each row where he is the sole director or one of multiple directors:\n\nBut the claim says \"most academy award - entered film , at 4,\" which might mean four entries.\n\nBut according to the table, Krsto Papi\u0107 has more than four Oscar submissions as a director. Therefore, the claim seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check each row where he is listed:\n\n- 1992: only him\n- 2001: only him\n- 2004: only him\n- 2006: only him\n- 2008: only him\n- 2012: only him\n\nThat's six entries.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is accurate because maybe in some years, he was not invited or something. But according to the table, he has more than four entries as a director.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Krsto Papi\u0107 had four Academy Award submissions is inaccurate based on the provided data. According to the table, Krsto Papi\u0107 has been involved in multiple Oscar submissions as a director, with at least six entries across various ceremonies. Therefore, the original statement does not hold true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect. Krsto Papi\u0107 has more than four Academy Award entries based on the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"Branko Schmidt's first and most recent Academy Award entry should be separated by 7 years.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify all entries in the table related to Branko Schmidt. Looking at the 'director (s)' column, I see his name appears multiple times. Specifically, he directed films from 1994 to 2009, with some breaks.\n\nNext, I need to find his first and most recent entries in the table. The earliest occurrence is in 1994 (row 3), and the latest is in 2012 (row 12). Wait, but row 13 is 2013, which isn't awarded yet, so the last award was in 2012.\n\nCalculating the difference between 2012 and 1994: 2012 - 1994 = 18 years. The claim says there's a 7-year gap. Clearly, 18 years doesn't match 7 years, so this would make the claim FALSE.\n\nBut I should double-check to ensure I didn't miss any entries. Scanning through the table again, Branko Schmidt directed films in 1994, then again in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and finally in 2012.
