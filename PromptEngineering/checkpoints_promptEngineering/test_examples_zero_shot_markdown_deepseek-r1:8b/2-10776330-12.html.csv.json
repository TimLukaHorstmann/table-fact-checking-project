    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"mcg be the venue when the crowd be more than 29000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that at the McGraw-Hahn (mcg) venue, there was a crowd that exceeded 29,000 people. So I need to check if any of the games played at mcg had a crowd over 29,000.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, along with the venue, crowd size, and date. The relevant columns here are \"venue\" and \"crowd\". Since we're interested in the mcg venue specifically, I'll focus on that column.\n\nNow, going through each row:\n\n1. First row: Venue is western oval, so not mcg.\n2. Second row: Venue is windy hill, not mcg.\n3. Third row: Venue is victoria park, nope.\n4. Fourth row: Venue is princes park, nope.\n5. Fifth row: Venue is lake oval, nope.\n6. Sixth row: Venue is mcg. Now, check the crowd number here.\n\nLooking at the \"crowd\" column for this row: It's listed as 29,947. That's more than 29,000. So that matches the claim\u2014mcg did have a crowd over 29k on that date.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"when the crowd be more than 29000.\" Does it mean only once? Or does it need to happen at mcg in general? Since there's one instance where mcg had 29,947, which is above 29k, it supports the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the row for mcg and the crowd column. Let me note their indices.\n\nLooking back, mcg is the sixth row (index 5). The crowd column is the fourth one. So the relevant cells are at row_index 5, column \"crowd\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all the match be hold on 8 july 1961\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully examining each part of the claim and comparing it with the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components. The claim states that all matches were held on \"8 july 1961.\" To verify this, I should check each row in the table to see if the date column has this specific date for every match listed.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different match between various teams. Each row includes details such as home team, scores, away team, venue, crowd size, and date. The dates all seem to be \"8 july 1961\" except for one potential entry that catches my eye.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row's date:\n\n1. First row: footscray vs richmond \u2013 date is 8 july 1961.\n2. Second row: essendon vs north melbourne \u2013 date is also 8 july 1961.\n3. Third row: collingwood vs geelong \u2013 same date, 8 july 1961.\n4. Fourth row: carlton vs st kilda \u2013 again, 8 july 1961.\n5. Fifth row: south melbourne vs hawthorn \u2013 date is 8 july 1961.\n6. Sixth row: melbourne vs fitzroy \u2013 here's the one that might be different. The date listed is also \"8 july 1961\".\n\nWait a second, so all six matches have the same date of 8 july 1961. Does that mean the claim is TRUE?\n\nBut hold on, I should make sure there are no exceptions or mismatches in the data. Let me go through each row again to confirm.\n\n- Row 0: 8 July 1961\n- Row 1: same date\n- Rows 2,3,4,5: all 8 July as well\n- Row 5: also 8 July\n\nSo every single match in the table was held on 8 July 1961. Therefore, the claim that \"all the matches were held on 8 july 1961\" is TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. Since all rows have this date as \"date,\" each row's date cell is relevant. So I'll list each row's index and the column name for the date.\n\nNow, putting it all together: answer is TRUE, and all six date cells in the table are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"north melbourne be the away team when the crowd be least\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It seems to say that in some game where North Melbourne was the away team, the crowd size at that venue was the least among all games listed on that particular date (8 July 1961). So I need to check if there's a game involving North Melbourne as the away team and whether that game had the smallest crowd attendance.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The \"away team\" column lists which team was visiting. The \"crowd\" column shows the number of people who attended each game. My task is to identify all games where North Melbourne is listed as the away team and then check their crowd numbers to see if any of them have the smallest crowd.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team - Footscray, Away team - Richmond. Crowd: 16648.\n2. **Row 1**: Home team - Essendon, Away team - North Melbourne. Crowd: 12800.\n3. **Row 2**: Home team - Collingwood, Away team - Geelong. Crowd: 20700.\n4. **Row 3**: Home team - Carlton, Away team - St Kilda. Crowd: 14636.\n5. **Row 4**: Home team - South Melbourne, Away team - Hawthorn. Crowd: 13860.\n6. **Row 5**: Home team - Melbourne, Away team - Fitzroy. Crowd: 29947.\n\nNow, I need to find all instances where North Melbourne is the away team. From the table, that's only in Row 1. The crowd number for that game was 12800.\n\nNext, I should check if this is indeed the smallest crowd among all games on the date. Let me list all crowd numbers:\n\n- Footscray vs Richmond: 16648\n- Essendon vs North Melbourne: 12800\n- Collingwood vs Geelong: 20700\n- Carlton vs St Kilda: 14636\n- South Melbourne vs Hawthorn: 13860\n- Melbourne vs Fitzroy: 29947\n\nNow, comparing these numbers:\n\nThe smallest number here is 12800 (Essendon vs North Melbourne). The next closest is 13860 (South Melbourne vs Hawthorn), which is larger. So yes, the crowd at that game was indeed the least among all listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because when North Melbourne was the away team, the crowd was the smallest.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we identified that North Melbourne was an away team once on 8 July 1961 with a crowd of 12,800.

The key elements are:\n\n1. **Away team score**: It should be 6.8 (44).\n2. **Home team**: It's Melbourne.\n3. **Venue**: It should be McG.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the home team is Melbourne and the venue is McG. \n\nI'll scan each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is Footscray, venue Western Oval.\n- Row 1: Home team Essendon, venue Windy Hill.\n- Row 2: Home team Collingwood, venue Victoria Park.\n- Row 3: Home team Carlton, venue Princes Park.\n- Row 4: Home team South Melbourne, venue Lake Oval.\n- Row 5: Home team Melbourne, venue McG.\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 5.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"home team score was 9.9 (63) when north melbourne be the away team play in windy hill.\" So, the claim is making a statement about a specific instance where the home team scored 9.9 (63), and that happened when North Melbourne was the away team playing at Windy Hill.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row corresponds to a different match on the same date, August 8th, 1961.\n\nI need to check each condition in the claim against the table data. The key parts of the claim are:\n1. Home team score is 9.9 (63).\n2. North Melbourne is the away team.\n3. The venue is Windy Hill.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\nRow 0: Home team is Footscray with a score of 6.6 (42). Away team is Richmond with 4.9 (33) at Western Oval, crowd 16648, date 8 July 1961. None of these match the claim.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Essendon with 9.9 (63). Away team is North Melbourne with 3.10 (28). Venue is Windy Hill, crowd 12800, date 8 July 1961. This matches all three conditions in the claim. So this row should be relevant.\n\nRow 2: Home team Collingwood scores 5.11 (41), away Geelong scores 8.10 (58) at Victoria Park. No match.\n\nRow 3: Carlton scores 9.8 (62), away St Kilda scores 3.12 (30) at Princes Park. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4: South Melbourne vs Hawthorn, scores 7.7 (49) and 9.11 (65). Venue Lake Oval. No match.\n\nRow 5: Melbourne vs Fitzroy both score 6.8 (44), venue MCG.

The claim is: \"mcg be the venue where the crowd be under 20000.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being claimed. It says that at McGraw (mcg), the crowd size was less than 20,000. So I need to look into the table provided and see if any row lists mcg as the venue with a crowd below 20,000.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, including details like scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check for mcg as the venue. \n\nThe first row: venue is western oval, crowd 16648. That's not mcg, so no. Next, windy hill, then victoria park, princes park, lake oval\u2014all of these are not mcg. The last row has mcg as the venue with a crowd of 29947. Wait, that's over 20,000.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"crowd be under 20000.\" So in this row, mcg had 29,947 people, which is way above 20k. That doesn't support the claim. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The last row's venue is mcg with a crowd of 29947. Yes, that's more than 20,000, so it doesn't meet the condition.\n\nSo, does any row have mcg as the venue and crowd under 20k? From the table, no. All other venues listed don't even come close to meeting that criteria, and mcg is only in one row with a high number.

The claim is: \"all the match be hold on different day.\" Hmm, I think there's a typo there\u2014probably meant \"day\" instead of \"be hold,\" but maybe it's a translation issue. Anyway, I'll focus on the main point.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that all the matches were held on different days. So each match should have its own unique date.\n\nLooking at the table provided, which lists several matches between various teams, each with their respective scores, venue, crowd size, and dates. The key column here for the claim is \"date,\" specifically since the claim is about when the matches took place.\n\nSo my task is to check if all the dates in this table are unique\u2014meaning no two matches have the same date. If they do, then the claim would be FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nLet me go through each row and note down the date:\n\n1. Footscray vs Richmond \u2013 8 July 1961\n2. Essendon vs North Melbourne \u2013 8 July 1961\n3. Collingwood vs Geelong \u2013 8 July 1961\n4. Carlton vs St Kilda \u2013 8 July 1961\n5. South Melbourne vs Hawthorn \u2013 8 July 1961\n6. Melbourne vs Fitzroy \u2013 8 July 1961\n\nWait a minute, all six matches have the same date: 8 July 1961. So they were all held on the same day, not different days. That directly contradicts the claim which says \"all the match be hold on different day.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo I need to check each relevant cell in the table that pertains to the date column. Each row has a date, so all these dates (row 0 to row 5) are relevant because they show when each match occurred.\n\nNow, according to the instructions, I have to return a JSON object with \"answer\" as either TRUE or FALSE and \"relevant_cells\" listing the specific cells that were checked.

The claim is: \"north melbourne be the home team where the attendance be lowest.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table to see if any of them have north melbourne as the home team because that's a key part of the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are six rows. The first column is \"home team,\" so I'll check each entry:\n\n1. footscray\n2. essendon\n3. collingwood\n4. carlton\n5. south melbourne\n6. melbourne\n\nWait, I don't see north melbourne listed as a home team in the table. The closest is \"north melbourne\" but it's under the away team column for the second row (essendon vs north melbourne). So perhaps there was a typo or confusion? Or maybe the claim is incorrect because north melbourne isn't the home team.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The table has each game with a home team and an away team. For example:\n\n- footscray is home, richmond is away.\n- essendon is home, north melbourne is away.\n- collingwood is home, geelong is away.\n- carlton is home, st kilda is away.\n- south melbourne is home, hawthorn is away.\n- melbourne is home, fitzroy is away.\n\nSo the \"north melbourne\" only appears as an away team in the second row. So they are not a home team in this table at all.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says north melbourne is the home team with lowest attendance, that's incorrect because north melbourne isn't even a home team here. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nNow, about the attendance: I need to check which home team had the lowest crowd number. So for each row, the \"crowd\" column shows the number of people who attended that game.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n- footscray: 16648\n- essendon: 12800\n- collingwood: 20700\n- carlton: 14636\n- south melbourne: 13860\n- melbourne: 29947\n\nThe lowest attendance is for south melbourne with 13860, then carlton at 14636, then essendon at 12800.

The claim is: \"the home team score be 6.8 (44) , when melbourne play in mcg\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific things: the home team's score should be 6.8 (44), and the game should be at Melbourne playing at the MCG.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with various details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The key columns here are \"home team\", \"away team\", \"home team score\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", and \"crowd\".\n\nSo, I need to find the row where the home team is Melbourne and the venue is MCG (mcg). Once I have that row, I can check if their home team score matches 6.8 (44).\n\nStarting with the home teams: looking through each row, the fifth one says \"melbourne\" as the home team. Let's see what the other details are in that row.\n\nIn the same row, the venue is listed as \"mcg\". So, this is the game where Melbourne is playing at MCG.\n\nNow, checking the score for the home team: the column for the home team score in that row is 6.8 (44). That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are met: when Melbourne plays at the MCG, their home team score was indeed 6.8 (44).\n\nI should list the relevant cells to confirm this. The \"row_index\" for Melbourne's game is 5. Wait, looking back, the table has rows starting from 0? Let me count:\n\n1. footscray\n2. essendon\n3. collingwood\n4. carlton\n5. south melbourne\n6. melbourne\n\nWait no, in the markdown table, each row is numbered as per their order. So the first row is index 0: footscray, then 1: essendon, up to 5: melbourne? Wait no, actually, looking at the markdown, it starts with 6 rows before melbourne.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\nRow 0: footscray\n\nRow 1: essendon\n\nRow 2: collingwood\n\nRow 3: carlton\n\nRow 4: south melbourne\n\nRow 5: melbourne\n\nSo yes, the melbourne row is index 5.\n\nIn that row, the columns relevant to the claim are \"home team score\" and \"venue\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index: 5, column_name: home team score\n- row_index: 5, column_name: venue\n\nThat's because we need both the home team (which is melbourne) and the venue (mcg) to confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the away team score be 9.9 (63) , when north melbourne play away at windy hill.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions two specific things: the away team's score and the context in which this happened.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there's a match where the away team is North Melbourne and they are playing away at Windy Hill. Then, check if their score is 9.9 (63).\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table to find any matches that fit this description.\n\nThe table has the following columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet me scan each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team is Footscray, away is Richmond. Venue is Western Oval. Doesn't match.\n2. Second row: Home team Essendon vs North Melbourne away. Venue Windy Hill. This seems relevant because the claim mentions North Melbourne playing away at Windy Hill. So let's check their score. The home team (Essendon) scored 9.9 (63), and the away team (North Melbourne) scored 3.10 (28). Wait, but the claim says the away team scored 9.9 (63), which doesn't match here because North Melbourne is the away team with a lower score.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check again. The second row: home team is Essendon, away is North Melbourne. So in this case, the away team's score is 3.10 (28). That doesn't match the claim which says the away team scored 9.9 (63).\n\nSo perhaps there's another row that fits the context where North Melbourne is the away team at Windy Hill.\n\nContinuing:\n\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs Geelong. Doesn't fit.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs St Kilda. Not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne vs Hawthorn. No match.\n6. Sixth row: Melbourne vs Fitzroy. Venue is MCG, not Windy Hill.\n\nWait a minute, so the only row where North Melbourne is the away team at Windy Hill is the second one, but their score isn't 9.9 (63). In that game, Essendon scored 9.9 (63), which was the home team's score, while North Melbourne scored lower as the away team.\n\nSo the claim seems to mix up the home and away teams' scores in that particular match. The claim says \"away team score be 9.9 (63)\", but in reality, the home team scored that when North Melbourne was away at Windy Hill.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where the away team scored 9.9 (63) specifically when North Melbourne played away at Windy Hill. So the claim is FALSE because the scores don't match up as described.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
