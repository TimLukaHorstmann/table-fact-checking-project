    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"During the 1942 VFL season, punt road oval venue recorded the highest crowd participation.\"\n\nI'll start by looking at the table provided. The table lists several matches from what seems to be the 1942 VFL season, with details like home team, scores, away team, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe key aspects of the claim are:\n1. The event is during the 1942 VFL season.\n2. Punt Road Oval is the venue.\n3. It recorded the highest crowd participation.\n\nLooking at the table, all matches listed have the date \"20 june 1942,\" which likely refers to the 1942 season. So, the first part of the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nNext, I need to check if Punt Road Oval had the highest crowd participation. To do this, I should look at the \"crowd\" column for matches played at Punt Road Oval and compare it with the other venues to see if it's the maximum.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- The first match is at Punt Road Oval with a crowd of 18,000.\n- The second match is at Brunswick Street Oval with 5,000.\n- Third match at Arden Street Oval: 4,000.\n- Fourth match at Toorak Park: 5,000.\n- Fifth match at Yarraville Oval: 8,500.\n\nNow, comparing these numbers:\n- Punt Road Oval has the highest crowd of 18,000.\n- The next highest is Yarraville Oval with 8,500.\n\nSo, yes, Punt Road Oval had the highest attendance among all listed venues for that date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. These would be:\n1. The row where home team is Richmond and away is South Melbourne (row index 0) because that's Punt Road Oval with the highest crowd.\n2. The \"crowd\" column for that specific match.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at row index 0, column \"crowd,\" and also perhaps the venue column if needed to confirm it's Punt Road Oval. But since the claim is about the highest participation, the crowd number suffices.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table data:\n\n1. **Season and Venue**: The matches are from June 20, 1942, which aligns with the claimed 1942 VFL season.\n\n2. **Crowd Participation**: Among all venues listed, Punt Road Oval had the highest crowd of 18,000.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is TRUE, supported by the maximum crowd figure at Punt Road Oval in the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a certain claim about a table is true or false. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"brunswick street oval venue record 1000 more crowd participant than that of the arden street oval venue.\" Okay, so it's comparing two venues\u2014Brunswick Street Oval and Arden Street Oval\u2014and their crowd numbers. The claim is stating that Brunswick had a crowd that's 1000 more than Arden.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the relevant cells. Each row represents a game with details like home team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. \n\nI'll scan each row for the keywords \"Brunswick Street Oval\" and \"Arden Street Oval.\" Starting from the top:\n\n1. The first row is Richmond vs. South Melbourne at Punt Road Oval. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: Fitroy vs. Hawthorn at Brunswick Street Oval. Crowd is 5000 here, but I'm not sure if this is the game being compared or just a data point.\n3. Third row: North Melbourne vs. Melbourne at Arden Street Oval. Crowd is 4000 here.\n4. Fourth row: St Kilda vs. Collingwood at Toorak Park. Not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: Footscray vs. Carlton at Yarraville Oval. Also not relevant.\n\nWait, so the claim is about two specific venues: Brunswick Street Oval and Arden Street Oval. In the table, there are two matches that fit these venues:\n\n- Fitroy vs. Hawthorn at Bruno (crowd 5000)\n- North Melbourne vs. Melbourne at Arden (crowd 4000)\n\nSo the relevant rows are row index 1 for Bruno and row index 2 for Arden.\n\nThe claim is about Brunswick having a crowd that's 1000 more than Arden. Let me check: 5000 - 4000 equals 1000. So yes, that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure if there are other instances of these venues in the table. Scanning again, it looks like only those two rows match. So the data points are correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the crowd at Brunswick Street Oval (5000) is indeed 1000 more than Arden Street Oval's 4000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the crowd numbers of two venues: Brunswick Street Oval and Arden Street Oval. The table shows that the game at Bruno had a crowd of 5000, while Arden had 4000. The difference is exactly 1000, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"toorak park be 1 of the 2 venue that record a crowd participation of 5000.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It's stating that Toorak Park is one of two venues where the crowd participation was exactly 5,000 people. So I need to check the table and see if this statement holds.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the 'crowd' column because that's what the claim is about. Let me go through each row to see which venues had a crowd of 5000.\n\nThe first row: venue is Punt Road Oval with a crowd of 18,000.\nSecond row: Brunswick Street Oval had 5,000 people.\nThird row: Arden Street Oval saw 4,000 attendees.\nFourth row: Toorak Park also had 5,000.\nFifth row: Yarraville Oval recorded 8,500.\n\nSo from the 'crowd' column, Punt Road Oval (18k), Brunswick Street Oval (5k), Arden Street Oval (4k), Toorak Park (5k), and Yarraville Oval (8.5k). That makes two venues with a crowd of exactly 5,000: Brunswick Street Oval and Toorak Park.\n\nThe claim says \"Toorak Park be one of the 2,\" which is correct because it's indeed listed as having 5,000 attendees. The other venue mentioned in the table with that crowd number is Brunswick Street Oval, but the claim doesn't mention it, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. Now, to find the relevant cells: I need to identify the row indices and column names for Toorak Park and whether its crowd was 5,000.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row index starts from 0.\n- The 'home team' is St Kilda in row 4 (since there are five rows total), but that's not relevant. Wait, no: each row has home and away teams. So the venue column corresponds to 'crowd' and 'date', etc.\n\nWait, let me clarify the columns:\n\nColumns are:\n1. home team\n2. home score\n3. away team\n4. away score\n5. venue\n6. crowd\n7. date\n\nSo for Toorak Park, it's in row 4 (since row indices start at 0: rows 0-4).\n\nLooking back, row 4 has 'toorak park' as the venue and 'crowd' of 5000. So the relevant cells are the 'crowd' cell in row 4.\n\nWait no, because the claim is about the venue having a crowd participation of 5k. So to confirm that, we need to check the crowd number for Toorak Park, which is column 'crowd', row 4.\n\nBut the claim doesn't specify whether it's looking at two venues in total or specifically that Toorak Park is one of them with 5k. But according to the table, yes, Toorak Park had exactly 5,000. So the relevant cells would be both the 'crowd' column for Toorak Park and perhaps another venue.\n\nWait no, the claim only mentions Toorak Park being one of two, so we just need to verify that Toorak Park's crowd was indeed 5k. The other venue is also important but not necessary to include in the relevant cells unless the instruction says so. But the instructions say to check each condition against the table.\n\nWait no, perhaps the claim is stating that Toorak Park is one of two venues with a certain crowd participation. So we need to confirm both conditions: that Toorak Park had 5k and that there was another venue also with 5k.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The 'crowd' column for Toorak Park (row 4).\n2. The 'crowd' column for the other venue, which is row 1 (Brunswick Street Oval).\n\nBut wait, in the table, row indices are from 0 to 4.\n\nRow 0: Punt Road Oval, crowd 18000\nRow 1: Brunswick St Oval, crowd 5000\nRow 2: Arden St Oval, 4000\nRow3: Toorak Park, 5000\nRow4: Yarraville Oval, 8500\n\nSo the two venues with 5k are row1 and row3.\n\nTherefore, to verify the claim that \"Toorak Park be 1 of the 2,\" we need to check:\n\n- Is Toorak Park's crowd 5k? Yes.\n- Are there exactly two venues with 5k? Yes, two: row1 and row3.\n\nBut perhaps the relevant cells are just for Toorak Park because that's what the claim is focusing on. Wait no, the claim says it's one of two, so to confirm that statement, we need both that Toorak Park has 5k and that another venue also has 5k. So the other venue is row1.\n\nBut the user instructions say: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" And for relevant cells, list which cells are checked.\n\nSo to support the claim, we need to ensure that:\n\n- The crowd at Toorak Park (row3) is 5000.\n- There is another venue with the same crowd number of 5000, so row1's crowd is also 5000.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be both:\n\n- For Toorak Park: column 'crowd', row 3 (since rows are 0-indexed). Wait no, in the table, row4 is St Kilda vs Collingwood. Wait wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait the rows:\n\nRow0: Richmond vs South Melbourne\nRow1: Fitzroy vs Hawthorn\nRow2: North Melbourne vs Melbourne\nRow3: St Kilda vs Collingwood\nRow4: Footscray vs Carlton\n\nSo Toorak Park is row3 (St Kilda's home game). So in the 'crowd' column, it's 5000. Therefore, the relevant cell is row3, column 'crowd'.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"toorak park be 1 of the 2 venue that record a crowd participation of 5000.\" So Toorak Park is one, and there's another one.\n\nIn the table, row1 (Fitzroy vs Hawthorn) is at Brunswick Street Oval with 5000. So to confirm the claim, we need both:\n\n- That Toorak Park had 5000.\n- That another venue also had 5000.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Toorak Park: row3, 'crowd'.\nFor the other venue: row1, 'crowd'.\n\nTherefore, in terms of JSON, it should include both these cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that Toorak Park had a crowd participation of 5,000 and there was another venue (Brunswick Street Oval) with the same figure. The relevant cells are the 'crowd' columns for rows 1 and 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The table confirms that Toorak Park had a crowd participation of 5,000 and another venue (Brunswick Street Oval) also had 5,000 attendees.\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"yarraville oval be 1 of the 5 venue that be put to use on 20 june 1942.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim is saying. It's asserting that Yarraville Oval was one of five venues used on June 20th, 1942.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several matches played on that date: Richmond vs South Melbourne, Fitzroy vs Hawthorn, North Melbourne vs Melbourne, St Kilda vs Collingwood, and Footscray vs Carlton. Each of these matches took place at different venues. \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check two things:\n1. Is Yarraville Oval listed as a venue in the table for that date?\n2. Are there exactly five unique venues used on that date?\n\nStarting with the first point: Scanning through each row's \"venue\" column. The first match is at Punt Road Oval, the second at Brunswick Street Oval, the third at Arden Street Oval, the fourth at Toorak Park, and the fifth at Yarraville Oval. So yes, Yarraville Oval is one of the venues listed.\n\nNext, counting the number of unique venues. Let me list them out:\n- Punt Road Oval\n- Brunswick Street Oval\n- Arden Street Oval\n- Toorak Park\n- Yarraville Oval\n\nThat's five different venues, so the second part of the claim is also true.\n\nPutting it all together, both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim should be considered TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to find which row and column correspond to Yarraville Oval in the table.

The claim says: \"melbourne away team record an away score of 12.11 (83) while south melbourne record an away score of 11.20 (86).\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: Melbourne and South Melbourne. It says Melbourne scored 12.11 (83) as an away team, and South Melbourne scored 11.20 (86) as an away team. So I need to check if both these scores exist in the table as away team scores for their respective teams.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row for \"melbourne\" and \"south melbourne\" in the away team column because that's what the claim is referring to.\n\nStarting with Melbourne: In the first row, the home team is Richmond, and the away team is South Melbourne. So this isn't Melbourne. Next, the second row has Hawthorn as the home team, but wait, no\u2014wait, actually, looking at the second row: home team is Fitzroy, away team is Hawthorn. Then third row: North Melbourne vs Melbourne. Wait, in the third row, the away team is Melbourne? Let me check.\n\nThird row: home team is North Melbourne, and away team is Melbourne. So the score for Melbourne as an away team would be 12.11 (83). That's exactly what the claim says. So that part seems correct.\n\nNow checking South Melbourne. In the first row, the home team is Richmond, away team is South Melbourne with a score of 11.20 (86). The claim also mentions this. So both scores are present in their respective rows as away team scores.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes teams can play each other multiple times, so maybe I should check all the rows to make sure there's no duplication or confusion.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n1. Richmond vs South Melbourne: South Melbourne scored 11.20 (86) away.\n2. Fitzroy vs Hawthorn: Not relevant for our claim.\n3. North Melbourne vs Melbourne: Melbourne scored 12.11 (83) away.\n4. St Kilda vs Collingwood: Not relevant.\n5. Footscray vs Carlton: Not relevant.\n\nSo only two rows are relevant here: row 1 for South Melbourne and row 3 for Melbourne.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by these cells in the table.

Richmond's venue is Punt Road Oval, which had 18000. Footscray's Yarraville Oval had 8500.

The claim is that \"brunswick street oval have the lowest overall crowd participation.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and identify which cells are relevant for checking the claim. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim is about the crowd numbers, specifically comparing them across different venues.\n\nSo, I need to focus on the \"crowd\" column to see which venues have the lowest attendances. The venues listed are:\n\n1. punt road oval\n2. brunswick street oval\n3. arden street oval\n4. toorak park\n5. yarraville oval\n\nThe claim is about brunswick street oval having the lowest crowd participation, so I should check how many people attended each venue.\n\nLooking at the \"crowd\" numbers:\n\n- punt road oval: 18000\n- brunswick street oval: 5000\n- arden street oval: 4000\n- toorak park: 5000\n- yarraville oval: 8500\n\nWait, so brunswick street oval has 5000 attendees. Let me see the other venues:\n\nPunt Road Oval had 18,000, which is way higher than 5k.\n\nArden Street Oval had 4,000, which is slightly less than brunswick's 5k.\n\nToorak Park had 5,000, same as brunswick.\n\nYarraville Oval had 8,500, so that's more than both brunswick and arden.\n\nSo, the lowest crowd participation would actually be Arden Street Oval with 4,000, right? Because it's lower than brunswick's 5k. So if the claim is about brunswick having the lowest, that wouldn't be correct because Arden had fewer people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"overall\" in the claim. Maybe they mean among all the venues, so the minimum. In that case, Arden is lower than brunswick, so the claim would be false because brunswick isn't the lowest.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\nBrunswick: 5k\n\nArden: 4k\n\nSo yes, arden has fewer attendees, making brunswick's attendance higher than the minimum. Therefore, the claim that brunswick has the lowest is incorrect.\n\nI should also make sure I'm looking at the right venues. All these are listed in the table, so it's just a matter of comparing the crowd numbers across them.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"brunswick street oval have the lowest overall crowd participation,\" we need to analyze the \"crowd\" column for each venue.\n\n- **punt road oval**: 18,000\n- **brunswick street oval**: 5,000\n- **arden street oval**: 4,000\n- **toorak park**: 5,000\n- **yarraville oval**: 8,500\n\nThe lowest attendance is at Arden Street Oval with only 4,000 people. Since brunswick street oval has a higher attendance (5,000) than this minimum, the claim that brunswick has the lowest overall crowd participation is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The \"crowd\" column is key to evaluating the claim.\n2. **List Attendances**: Compare each venue's crowd number.\n3. **Find Minimum**: Determine which venue has the smallest attendance.\n4. **Compare with Claim**: Since Arden Street Oval has fewer attendees, brunswick street oval does not have the lowest.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is false because arden street oval had a lower crowd participation than brunswick street oval.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"yarraville oval be the only venue not put to use on 20 june 1942.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. It has five rows, each representing a match between two teams. The columns include home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim is about \"yarraville oval\" being the only venue not used on that specific date. So I need to check each row's venue column to see if any others are present besides \"yarraville oval.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first match is at punt road oval.\n2. The second is at brunswick street oval.\n3. The third is at arden street oval.\n4. The fourth is at toorak park.\n5. The fifth is at yarraville oval.\n\nSo, out of the five venues listed, only \"yarraville oval\" isn't used by any other team? Wait, no. Each match has its own venue, so all the venues except maybe one are being used. Let me see:\n\n- punt road oval: yes, used.\n- brunswick street oval: yes.\n- arden street oval: yes.\n- toorak park: yes.\n- yarraville oval: yes.\n\nWait, no, each row has a different venue, right? So all five venues are being used on that date. But the claim says \"yarraville oval be the only venue not put to use,\" which seems contradictory because in the table, yarraville oval is being used by footscray against carlton.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could mean that on 20 June 1942, only yarraville oval wasn't used by any other match. Let me check: each row has a unique venue. So if the claim says yarraville is the only one not used, but in reality, it's being used in one of the matches, then the claim is false.\n\nSo, for example, punt road oval is used once, brunswick street oval once, etc., including yarraville oval once. Therefore, all venues are used. So the claim that yarraville is the only one not used would be incorrect because it's actually being used.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the ones where the venue is \"yarraville oval\" to show it's being used.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each row for the venue. The last row uses \"yarraville oval,\" so the claim that it was not used is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the melbourne away team have score that be 4 point higher than the south melbourne away team",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this table in front of me and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"the melbourne away team have a score that's 4 points higher than the south melbourne away team.\" My task is to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It lists various matches with details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The key columns here are \"away team\" and their respective scores.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim. It mentions two teams: Melbourne and South Melbourne. Both are listed as away teams in different rows. So I need to find the row where the away team is Melbourne and another where it's South Melbourne, then compare their scores.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row has Richmond as the home team with a score of 10.9 (69). The away team is South Melbourne with 11.20 (86).\n2. The second row is Fitzroy vs Hawthorn, not relevant.\n3. Third row: North Melbourne vs Melbourne. Here, Melbourne is the away team with a score of 12.11 (83). Their opponents are North Melbourne with 11.10 (76).\n4. Fourth row: St Kilda as home with 11.14 (80) against Collingwood. Not relevant for Melbourne or South Melbourne.\n5. Fifth row: Footscray vs Carlton. Again, not the teams in question.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I'm focusing on the correct away teams. The claim is about the \"Melbourne away team\" and the \"South Melbourne away team.\" So I should look for a match where Melbourne is the away team and another where South Melbourne is the away team.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Melbourne as away: Looking through the rows, the third row has Melbourne as the away team against North Melbourne. Their score is 12.11 (83).\n- South Melbourne as away: The first row lists South Melbourne as the away team against Richmond with a score of 11.20 (86).\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing because in the table, each row shows home and away teams. So for the first row:\n\n- Home: Richmond\n- Away: South Melbourne\n\nFor the third row:\n\n- Home: North Melbourne\n- Away: Melbourne\n\nSo, according to this, the away team is Melbourne with 12.11 (83). The claim says Melbourne's score is 4 points higher than South Melbourne's. But in the first row, South Melbourne scored 86.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 12.11 (83) vs 11.20 (86). So Melbourne has 83, South Melbourne has 86. The difference would be negative, not positive. That suggests Melbourne is lower than South Melbourne by 3 points.\n\nBut the claim says Melbourne's score is higher by 4 points. So that would mean I'm looking for a scenario where Melbourne scored 86 and South Melbourne scored 82 or something? But in the table, South Melbourne has 86 and Melbourne has 83. The difference is -3.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rows. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the third row:\n\n- Home team: North Melbourne\n- Away team: Melbourne\n- Score: 12.11 (83)\n\nFirst row:\n\n- Home team: Richmond\n- Away team: South Melbourne\n- Score: 11.20 (86)\n\nSo, in this case, South Melbourne has a higher score than Melbourne by 3 points. The claim says Melbourne is ahead by 4 points. That's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the away teams. Let me check all the rows again to see if there's another match where South Melbourne is the home team or something else.\n\nNo, looking at the table, South Melbourne is only listed as an away team in the first row. There's no other occurrence of South Melbourne being a home team or away team elsewhere. So the only score for South Melbourne is 86, and Melbourne's away score is 83.\n\nSo, the claim says Melbourne (away) has a score that's 4 points higher than South Melbourne (away). But in reality, it's the opposite: South Melbourne scored 86, Melbourne scored 83, so South Melbourne is higher by 3 points. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there are multiple matches between these teams, but looking at the table, each team plays once on June 20, 1942. So, in this context, there's only one match for each away team mentioned.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, Melbourne (away) scored 83, South Melbourne (away) scored 86. The difference is -3, not +4. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the scores of the Melbourne and South Melbourne away teams in the table. The scores are 12.11 (83) for Melbourne and 11.20 (86) for South Melbourne. This shows that Melbourne's score is actually lower than South Melbourne's by 3 points, not higher by 4.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
