The players mentioned are Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola and Javier Morales. Let's find their rows in the table.\n\nStarting with Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola: His row is ranked 9th. According to the table, his nation is Argentina (arg). The years listed are from 2007 to 2012. That matches the claim for his national origin and time period.\n\nNext, Javier Morales: His row is ranked 6th. The table shows his nation as Argentina (arg) as well. The years he's active are from 2007 to present. The claim mentions that he has years 2007 - present, which aligns perfectly with the data in the table.\n\nSo both players are indeed from Argentina, and their respective time periods match what's stated. There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy here. \n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data for both players, making it TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about players in a table is TRUE or FALSE based on their nationalities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. The claim states: \"player nick rimando , kyle beckerman , chris wingert , and nat borchers be from the usa\". So, it's asserting that all four of these players are from the USA.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should check each player's nationality one by one. Let's go through them.\n\n1. **Nick Rimando**: The table shows his nation as \"usa\" (all lowercase). Wait, but sometimes nationalities might be capitalized or in a specific format. However, in this case, it clearly says \"usa\", so he is from the USA.\n\n2. **Kyle Beckerman**: Similarly, his nation is listed as \"usa\". So, he's also from the USA.\n\n3. **Chris Wingert**: His nationality is \"usa\" as well. That checks out.\n\n4. **Nat Borchers**: The table says \"usa\" again. So, he is definitely from the USA.\n\nSince all four players have their nationality listed as \"usa\" in the table, the claim that they are all from the USA seems to be TRUE based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any chance of a typo or formatting issue. For example, sometimes names might be misspelled, but here they seem correct. Also, making sure that each player is correctly associated with their respective row in the table. Let me double-check the row indices to ensure I didn't mix up any players.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Nick Rimando is rank 1.\n- Kyle Beckerman is rank 3.\n- Chris Wingert is rank 4.\n- Nat Borchers is rank 5.\n\nAll are correctly listed, and their nationalities are all \"usa\". There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy or exception in the data that would contradict the claim.\n\nTherefore, after carefully analyzing each relevant player's nationality against the table, I can confidently say that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So for each player mentioned in the claim, I need to find their goals.\n\nStarting with Kyle Beckerman. His name is spelled as \"kyle beckerman\" in the claim but in the table it's listed as \"kyle beckerman\". The nation is USA, which matches. For caps and goals: In the table, he has 177 caps and 21 goals. So that part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNext, Nat Borchers. The claim says he has only 9 goals. Looking at the table, under player \"nat borchers\", he has 173 caps and 9 goals. That matches the claim as well.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other players with similar names or if there's a typo. For example, is it possible that Nat Borchers is spelled differently in the table? The table lists him correctly as \"nat borchers\" with 9 goals.\n\nSo both parts of the claim check out.

The claim is about three players' years being \"2007 - present.\" So, my focus will be on the 'years' column for each of these players.\n\nStarting with Kyle Beckerman, I find him in row 3 (since ranks start at 1). His 'years' are listed as \"2007 - present,\" which matches the claim. That's one point in favor of the claim being true.\n\nNext is Chris Wingert. He\u2019s in row 4. His 'years' also say \"2007 - present.\" So that's another match. \n\nNow, Javier Morales is in row 6, and his 'years' are \"2007 - present\" as well.

The table seems straightforward, and each player's years column has the exact same range.

It mentions two players: Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola and Javier Morales. The claim states that both are not from Argentina (arg).

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"player kyle beckerman who be not from the usa have more than 21 goal , but player nat borchers who also isn't from the usa have only 4 goal\"\n\nWait, there seems to be a typo in the claim. It says \"who be not from the usa,\" which should probably be \"is not from the usa.\" Also, I think the intended meaning is that Kyle Beckerman, who is NOT from the USA, has more than 21 goals, but Nat Borchers, also not from the USA, only has 4 goals.\n\nBut looking at the table provided:\n\n| rank | player           | nation   |   caps |   goals | years                        |\n|------:|:-----------------|:---------|-------:|--------:|:-----------------------------|\n|      1 | nick rimando     | usa      |    201 |       0 | 2007 - present               |\n|      2 | andy williams    | jam      |    189 |      14 | 2005 - 2011                  |\n|      3 | kyle beckerman   | usa      |    177 |      21 | 2007 - present               |\n|      4 | chris wingert    | usa      |    174 |       1 | 2007 - present               |\n|      5 | nat borchers     | usa      |    173 |       9 | 2008 - present               |\n|      6 | javier morales   | arg      |    155 |      28 | 2007 - present               |\n|      7 | tony beltran     | usa      |    135 |       0 | 2008 - present               |\n|      8 | ned grabavoy     | usa      |    126 |       8 | 2009 - present               |\n|      9 | fabi\u00e1n esp\u00edndola | arg      |    125 |      35 | 2007 - 2012                  |\n|     10 | robbie findley   | usa      |    121 |      35 | 2007 - 2010 , 2013 - present |\n\nWait, so in the table, Kyle Beckerman is listed as being from the USA (nation: usa), and Nat Borchers is also from the USA. So both are from the USA.\n\nBut the claim says that they aren't from the USA. That seems to be a problem because according to the table, both players are indeed from the USA. Therefore, the premise of the claim might already be incorrect.\n\nHowever, perhaps I should proceed as per instructions: carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant.\n\nSo, the claim has two parts:\n\n1. Player Kyle Beckerman, who is not from the USA, has more than 21 goals.\n2. Player Nat Borchers, who is also not from the USA, has only 4 goals.\n\nBut from the table:\n\n- Kyle Beckerman's nation is USA, so he is from the USA. Therefore, the claim's first part is incorrect because it states he isn't from the USA but claims he has more than 21 goals. But since he is from the USA, this part doesn't apply.\n  \n- Nat Borchers's nation is also USA, so he is from the USA as well. The claim says he isn't and only has 4 goals. Since he is actually from the USA, this part is also incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the table entries.\n\nLooking at row 5: player nat borchers, nation usa, caps 173, goals 9, years 2008-present.\n\nSo both players are indeed from the USA. Therefore, the claim's assertion that they aren't is incorrect. So does that mean the entire claim is false?\n\nBut perhaps I should consider whether the claim is making an error about their nationalities or their goal counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table was misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, row 6 is javier morales from arg, and row 9 is fabi\u00e1n esp\u00edndola from arg. So Nat Borchers is at row 5, nation usa.\n\nSo both players are USA citizens. Therefore, the claim's statements about their nationalities are wrong. Hence, regardless of the goal counts, since they're both US players, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check what the claim says exactly: it says \"player kyle beckerman who be not from the usa have more than 21 goal , but player nat borchers who also isn't from the usa have only 4 goal.\"\n\nSo the claim is asserting two things about players who supposedly are not from the USA. But in reality, both are from the USA. Therefore, the entire statement is incorrect because it's based on false assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look beyond that and see if the numbers make sense. For example, even if they were not from the USA, would their goal counts match? But since they are from the USA, that part is irrelevant.\n\nSo in conclusion, the claim is FALSE because both players are indeed from the USA, making the premise of the claim incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Kyle Beckerman and Nat Borchers are not from the USA.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"player ned grabavoy from the usa have less than 8 goal while player tony beltran have 5 goal.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists players with their ranks, caps, goals, and years. My task is to check each part of the claim against the table data.\n\nStarting with \"player ned grabavoy from the usa.\" In the table, looking for Ned Grabavoy. Scanning through the 'player' column: 1. nick rimando, 2. andy williams, 3. kyle beckerman, 4. chris wingert, 5. nat borchers, 6. javier morales, 7. tony beltran, 8. ned grabavoy, etc. So Ned Grabavoy is rank 8.\n\nNext, checking his goals. The 'goals' column for Ned Grabavoy (row 8) shows a value of 8. Now, the claim says he has \"less than 8 goal.\" Wait, that's not correct because he actually has exactly 8 goals. So this part is FALSE.\n\nNow, looking at Tony Beltr\u00e1n. He's ranked 7 in the table. The claim states he has 5 goals. Checking his 'goals' column: it shows 0. So that's also incorrect; he has 0 goals.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the claim are false. The first part says Ned Grabavoy has less than 8 goals when he actually has exactly 8. The second part claims Tony Beltr\u00e1n has 5 goals, but he actually has 0. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
