    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier be played in Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's about a specific competition and venue. The key points are:\n- Event: 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier\n- Venue: Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona\n\nI need to check if there's an entry in the table that matches both of these.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find any that mention the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier and see where it was held. \n\nLet me start scanning each row:\n\n1. The first row (6 April 2006) is about the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup, so not relevant.\n2. Second row same as above.\n3. Third row (10 June 2007) mentions Hong Kong vs Macau, but it's for the 2007 Hong Kong-Macau Interport, so no.\n4. Fourth row (21 June 2007) is about the 2008 East Asian Championship Qualifier in Macau, not relevant.\n5. Fifth row (8 Oct 2007) is a FIFA World Cup qualifier in Bangkok, irrelevant.\n6. Sixth row (15 Oct 2007) same as above, different venue but still FIFA World Cup.\n7. Seventh row (24 May 2008) is the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier in Phnom Penh, not our target.\n8. Eighth row (11 March 2009) mentions two qualifiers: one for 2008 and another for 2010 East Asian Football Championship. Not matching 2013 or venue Leo Palace.\n9. Ninth row same as above, different score but same context.\n10. Tenth row (15 March 2009) again about 2010 East Asian qualifier but in the same venue.\n11. Eleventh row same as tenth.\n12. Twelfth row (7 April 2009) is for the 2010 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier, not 2013 and different venue.\n13. Thirteenth row (14 April 2009) also about 2010 AFC Challenge in a different city.\n14. Fourteenth row (20 July 2012) mentions Leo Palace Soccer Field but it's for the 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier, not 2013. So venue matches but year doesn't.\n15. Fifteenth row same as above, different scores but same event year.\n16. Sixteenth row also about 2012 event.\n17. Seventeenth row same as fifteenth and sixteenth.\n18. Eighteenth row (25 Sept 2012) is the Philippine Peace Cup in Manila, so irrelevant.\n\nNow, I'm looking for any row where both the competition is the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier and the venue is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona.\n\nFrom the above scan, none of the rows mention the 2013 event. The closest is the 2012 events, but not 2013. So there's no entry in the table that matches both the competition and venue specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona. Checking each row, none match both the event year (2013) and venue (Leo Palace). The closest matches are for 2012 events but not 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
