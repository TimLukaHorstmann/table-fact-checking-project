The claim states: \"the winner of the womens single in 2001 be jelena obri\u0107.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for different categories like mens singles, womens singles, etc., and each row represents a specific year from 1994 to 2001.\n\nThe claim is about the \"womens singles\" category in 2001. So, I should focus on the row for 2001 and the column named \"womens singles.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the row for 2001 has \"jelena obri\u0107\" listed under the \"womens singles\" column.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is \"ivan \u0111uri\u0107 win the men's single in 1978.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with years ranging from 1994 to 2001. Each row corresponds to a specific year and lists winners for different categories: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nThe claim mentions \"ivan \u0111uri\u0107\" winning the men's singles in 1978. Hmm, looking at the table, the earliest year is 1994, which means there's no data before that. So, for the year 1978, the table doesn't have any entries because it starts from 1994 onwards.\n\nSince the table starts in 1994 and goes up to 2001, the claim about 1978 isn't covered at all. Therefore, there's no information in the table that can verify whether ivan \u0111uri\u0107 won the men's singles in 1978. Without any data for that year, I can't confirm the claim.\n\nI also notice that all the years listed are from 1994 to 2001. So any claims outside this range, like 1978, aren't addressed in the table. That makes it impossible to verify the statement based on the provided information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since there's no relevant data for the year 1978 in the table, the claim can't be fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, I checked each relevant cell in the table. The claim refers to a year (1978) not present in the provided table (1994-2001), making it impossible to verify.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"jelena obri\u0107 go on to win woman's single in 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions that Jelena Obri\u0107 won a women's singles event in 1997. So I need to check the relevant row for 1997 and see if there's any information about her competing or winning in women's singles that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific year. The columns are: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. For the year 1997 (row index 4), let me check the \"women's singles\" column. According to the table, in 1997, Jovan Markovi\u0107 is listed as the winner of men's singles, and Jovanka Kne\u017eevi\u0107 is in women's singles. So Jelena Obri\u0107 isn't mentioned here. Wait, that might be confusing because I thought she was involved.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. The row for 1997 has \"jovan markovi\u0107\" under men's singles and \"jovanka kne\u017eevi\u0107\" under women's singles. So Jelena Obri\u0107 isn't listed as the winner of women's singles in 1997. But perhaps she was a participant in another category, like doubles.\n\nWait, no, the claim is specifically about winning women's singles. So if she didn't win in that category in 1997, then the claim might be false. However, maybe I should look further into her participation elsewhere to see if it's possible that the claim could still hold true, but from what I see in the table, Jelena Obri\u0107 was part of women's doubles in some years, like 1998 and 2000 with different partners.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from another perspective. Maybe she did win a women's singles event later on, but in 1997 she didn't. So to verify the claim, I need to check if in 1997 she won the women's singles title as per the table data. Since the table shows Jovanka Kne\u017eevi\u0107 as the winner that year, and not Jelena Obri\u0107, the claim would be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake because sometimes people can have different names or spellings. Let me double-check the 1997 row again. The women's singles for 1997 is indeed listed under \"jovanka kne\u017eevi\u0107\", not Jelena Obri\u0107. So that would mean Jelena didn't win that category in 1997.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes names can be similar. Let me check the other years to see if she ever won women's singles. For example, in 1998, the women's singles winner is \"jelena obri\u0107\". So perhaps she did win in 1998, but not in 1997.\n\nSo the claim says she won in 1997. Since that's not the case according to the table, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if she was present as a participant in women's singles in 1997. The table for 1997 shows her in the men's doubles column: \"bojan jakovljevi\u0107 ru\u017eica mari\u0107\". So Jelena Obri\u0107 is part of the mixed doubles with Bojan Jakovljevi\u0107, but she isn't listed as a participant in women's singles that year.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim that \"jelena obri\u0107 go on to win woman's single in 1997\" is FALSE because she didn't win the women's singles in that specific year according to the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"}]}",
