    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about bosone's cardinalatial order and title is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"bosone 's cardinalatial order and title be cardinal - priest of s anastasia and be elevate circa 1116.\" \n\nI need to check each part of the claim against the relevant cells in the table. The table has several columns: elector, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, elevated, and elevator. I'm particularly interested in the \"cardinalatial order and title\" and the \"elevated\" columns for bosone.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for the name \"bosone.\" Scanning down each row, yes, there's a row with \"bosone\" as the elector. Let me confirm that: yes, it's in the first column of the fourth row (row index 3). So, this is the relevant cell.\n\nNow, checking the \"cardinalatial order and title\" for bosone. According to the table, it says \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" The claim also states that bosone holds this specific title. That matches exactly, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that bosone was elevated \"circa 1116.\" Looking at the \"elevated\" column for bosone's row, it says \"circa 1116.\" So that part is also correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure there are no discrepancies. Sometimes, elevations can have a range or different sources, so I should make sure that the date in the table matches what's claimed. The table lists bosone's elevation as \"circa 1116,\" which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, the elevator column for bosone is listed as \"paschal ii.\" However, the claim doesn't mention this part, so it's not necessary to verify unless the claim refers to something else related. But in this case, the claim only specifies the title and elevation date, both of which are correctly supported by the table.\n\nIs there any other information needed? The nationality is Italy, but the claim doesn't reference that, so we don't need to check it unless it's part of the claim, which it isn't. So, focusing solely on what's stated in the claim: title and elevation date are both correctly matched by bosone's entry.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"elevated\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the pisa elector be elevate in 1117\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a \"pisa elector.\" Looking at the table, I should look for any row where the nationality is Italy and the elevating year is around 1117. Wait, no, actually, the nationality might not be necessary here because Pisa is a place, not a nationality. So maybe the key is to find an entry with \"pisa\" in the elector column.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. The first row: Kuno von Urach from Germany.\n2. Second row: Lamberto Scannabecchi from Fagnano.\n3. Third row: John of Crema from Crema.\n4. Fourth row: Guido Galli, OSB from Italy.\n5. Fifth row: Bosone from Italy.\n6. Sixth row: Corrado de Suburra from Rome.\n7. Seventh row: Gregorio Papareschi, CanReglat from Rome.\n8. Eighth row: Pietro Pierleoni from Rome.\n9. Ninth row: Crisogono Malcondini from Pisa.\n10. Tenth row: Roscemanno SansEVERINO, OSbCas from Marsica.\n\nSo, the ninth row is the one where the elector is from Pisa. The column for that row is \"cardinal - deacon of s nicola in carcere.\" The year he was elevated is 1117, as per the table. \n\nNow, the claim says the Pisa elector was elevated in 1117. So checking the ninth row's 'elevated' column, it's indeed 1117.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table where the Pisa elector, Crisogono Malcondini, was elevated in 1117.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"the cardinalatial order and title of bosone be cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. There's a column called \"cardinalatial order and title\" which seems to list the roles and titles of each person. Then there's another column for their nationality.\n\nI need to find the row where the name is bosone. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. kuno von urach\n2. lamberto scannabecchi , canreg\n3. john of crema\n4. guido galli , osb\n5. bosone\n6. corrado de suburra\n7. gregorio papareschi , canreglat\n8. pietro pierleoni\n9. crisogono malcondini\n10. roscemanno sanseverino , osbcas\n\nSo bosone is row 5. Now, looking at the \"cardinalatial order and title\" column for this row. It says \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" \n\nWait, but in the claim it's stated as \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" That matches exactly. So the claim is saying that bosone has this title, which according to the table, he does. \n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells. The column name is \"cardinalatial order and title,\" so only that cell is needed. \n\nSo both conditions in the claim (the cardinalatial order and the specific title) are met. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nThe relevant_cells would just include bosone's row index (5) and the column name.

The claim states: \"the cardinal - priest of s anastasia be the cardinal order and title that be elevated earlier than 1116.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various cardinals with their nationalities, orders, titles, years of elevation, and elevator information.\n\nI need to find all entries where the \"cardinal - priest\" role is associated with the \"s anastasia.\" From the table, the relevant rows are:\n\n1. **Bosone** from Italy: cardinal-priest of s anastasia, elevated around 1116.\n2. **Gregorio Papareschi**: mentioned as a deacon, not a priest.\n3. Other cardinals like Kuno von Urach and Guido Galli are also priests but for different titles.\n\nWait, the second row is Lamberto Scannabecchi, which is about fagnano, so that's not relevant here. The third row is John of Crema, again a priest but not for s anastasia.\n\nLooking at Bosone, his elevation year is around 1116. The claim says \"elevated earlier than 1116.\" Since 1116 is the cutoff, Bosone was elevated in 1116 or thereabouts, which doesn't make him earlier than that. So he doesn't meet the criteria of being elevated before 1116.\n\nThe next relevant row is Corrado de Surbura, but he's a priest for s pudenziana, not anastasia. Then, looking at Gregorio Papareschi, although he was a deacon, not a priest. However, there's another cardinal named Crisogono Malcondini, who is a deacon of s nicola in carcere. But the claim specifically mentions \"cardinal-priest\" of s anastasia.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me check again. The fourth row is Guido Galli, but he's a priest of s balbina. The fifth row is Bosone again, as mentioned before.\n\nSo, after reviewing all rows, the only cardinal-priest of s anastasia is Bosone, elevated around 1116. Since the claim says \"earlier than 1116,\" and 1116 is not earlier, this doesn't meet the condition.\n\nTherefore, there's no cardinal-priest of s anastasia who was elevated before 1116 in the table. So the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we first identify the relevant rows where \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\" is present. In the given table, only Bosone fits this description, with his elevation year around 1116. Since the claim specifies earlier than 1116, and Bosone's elevation is not before that year, the claim doesn't hold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the elector from pis be elevate in 1117 by urban ii (or paschal ii)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with several columns: elector, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, elevated, and elevator. My task is to check each part of the claim against this table.\n\nThe claim has two main parts: the elector from Pisa and their elevation in 1117 by Urban II (or Paschal II). So I need to verify if there's an entry in the table where the nationality is Italy, but wait, no\u2014actually, the claim mentions \"pis\" but looking back, the column is \"nationality,\" so maybe I should check the nationality or perhaps it's a typo and refers to Pisa as a place of origin.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The claim says \"the elector from pisa be elevate in 1117 by urban ii (or paschal ii).\" So \"pis\" might actually be a misspelling of \"Pisa.\" So I should look for an elector from Pisa.\n\nLooking at the table, one of the rows has the elector name Crisogono Malcondini and nationality Pisa. That seems relevant because he's from Pisa. Now, checking his elevation date: it says 1117, which matches the claim's year.\n\nNext part is who elevated him. The claim mentions Urban II or Paschal II. Looking at the table, for Crisogono Malcondini, the \"elevator\" column has \"paschal ii (or paschal ii)\". So that means his elevation could be attributed to either Urban II or Paschal II.\n\nSince the claim allows for either Urban II or Paschal II as the possible elevators, and the table confirms that he was elevated in 1117 by someone who is either of those two, then this part checks out too.\n\nPutting it all together: there's an elector from Pisa (Crisogono Malcondini) who was elevated in 1117, possibly by Urban II or Paschal II. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on these cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data, specifically the row for Crisogono Malcondini.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"elevator\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the elector bosone be from rome and receive the cardinalatial order and title of the cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts. The first part says that Bosone is from Rome, and the second part states that he received the title of Cardinal-Priest of S. Anastasia.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to Bosone. Scanning through the table, I see a row where the elector is \"bosone\". That's in the fourth row (since we start counting from 0, it's row index 5). Let me double-check that: first row is kuno von urach, second is lamberto scannabecchi, third is john of crema, fourth is guido galli, fifth is bosone. Yes, so Bosone is in row 4 (index 5).\n\nNow, looking at the columns for this row. The relevant columns to check are 'nationality' and 'cardinalatial order and title'. \n\nFor nationality: The column value is \"italy\". So the claim says he's from Rome, but according to the table, it's Italy. Since Rome is part of Italy, does that mean the claim is correct? Well, technically, Rome is a city in Italy, so saying he's from Italy is accurate, but maybe the claim is more specific by saying 'from rome'. So I need to see if the nationality column matches \"italy\" as per the table. If the table says Italy, then claiming he's from Rome might not be technically correct because he's from Italy as a country, not necessarily specifically Rome. Wait, but sometimes in historical records, people are referred to by their city or region within Italy. For example, someone from Rome would be specified as 'from rome' rather than just 'italy'. So maybe the claim is incorrect in that aspect.\n\nWait, looking back at the table: The nationality column for Bosone says \"italy\". So if the claim states he's from Rome, but the table shows Italy, then technically, it's not entirely accurate. However, sometimes in historical contexts, people are identified by their city or region within a country. For example, someone from Rome would be noted as 'from rome' rather than just 'italy'. So perhaps the claim is trying to specify that he's from Rome, but the table only mentions Italy.\n\nNext, looking at the cardinalatial order and title: The column says \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\". The claim states this exactly. So the second part of the claim matches the table.\n\nSo combining both parts: The nationality is stated as rome in the claim, but the table says Italy. Does that make the entire claim false? Because 'italy' and 'rome' are different in specificity. If the claim is claiming he's from Rome specifically, but the table just says Italy, then perhaps it's incorrect.\n\nHowever, sometimes in historical documents, when someone is from a city within Italy, they might be referred to as being from that city without necessarily explicitly stating 'italy'. But in this table, the nationality column for Bosone is clearly \"italy\". So if the claim says he's from rome, and the table says Italy, then it's technically incorrect. Therefore, the claim would be false because while he did receive the correct title, his nationality isn't specified as Rome but rather Italy.\n\nWait, but sometimes people can be from a region within Italy, like being from Rome is more specific than Italy. So maybe the table is just giving the country, and the claim is more specific about the city. If that's the case, then the claim could be considered incorrect because it's adding more specificity than what's in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The nationality column might not always refer to the exact city but the country. So if the table says Italy, then saying he's from Rome is accurate because Rome is in Italy. But technically, the claim adds an extra detail that's not present in the table. Therefore, the claim could be seen as incorrect.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"the elector bosone be from rome\", so if the nationality column is \"italy\", then he's indeed from Italy, which includes Rome. So saying he's from Rome might be correct because it's a subset of Italy. But I'm not sure if the table specifies exactly where in Italy he's from. It just says Italy.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect regarding his nationality because the table only states Italy, not specifically Rome. Therefore, the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bosone is from Rome and received the title of Cardinal-Priest of S. Anastasia. The table confirms he received the title correctly but lists his nationality as Italy, not specifically Rome. Since the table doesn't specify Rome, the claim's statement about his origin is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"paschal ii be the elevator for the elector from cream circa 1106.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand each part of this claim. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Elector**: This refers to the individual whose information is in the table.\n2. **Nationality**: Not directly relevant unless it's needed for identification.\n3. **Cardinalatial Order and Title**: This seems to describe the position or title held by the elector.\n4. **Elevated**: The year they were elevated to their position, likely as a cardinal.\n5. **Elevator**: The person who elevates them, which I assume is someone in a higher position, perhaps another cardinal.\n\nThe claim specifies \"the elector from cream circa 1106.\" So, the elector's nationality is Italy (since Cream isn't listed as a nationality; looking at the table, the nationalities are Germany, Fagnano, Crema, Italy, etc.), but in the table, there's an entry for John of Crema. Wait, let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The fifth row (index 4) is John of Crema, nationality Italy? Wait no, looking at the columns, the nationalities are 'germany', 'fagnano', 'crema', 'italy', etc. So for each elector, their nationality is listed.\n\nWait, the table has:\n\n- kuno von urach: germany\n- lamberto scannabecchi , canreg: fagnano\n- john of crema: crema\n- guido galli , osb: italy\n- bosone: italy\n- corrado de suburra: rome\n- gregorio papareschi , canreglat: rome\n- pietro pierleoni: rome\n- crisogono malcondini: pisa\n- roscemanno sanseverino , osbcas: marsica\n\nSo, the elector from \"crema\" would be John of Crema (row index 2). Now, let's check his details.\n\nJohn of Crema has:\n\n- Cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - priest of s crisogono\n- Elevated: circa 1117\n- Elevator: paschal ii\n\nSo, the \"elevator\" for John of Crema is paschal ii. The claim says that paschal ii is the elevator for the elector from cream (crema) circa 1106.\n\nWait, but the elevated year for John of Crema is circa 1117. So the claim says \"circa 1106,\" which doesn't match. That's a discrepancy.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm looking at the right row. The elector from crema is indeed in row index 2 (John of Crema). His elevated year is \"circa 1117.\" So the claim mentions \"circa 1106,\" which doesn't align with the table data.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's another elector from crema? Looking back, no. The only one from crema is John of Crema in row index 2.\n\nWait, but looking at other rows: for example, Guido Galli (row 3) is from Italy, and his elevated year is circa 1099. Corrado de suburra (row 5) has a range from ca 1111-1114. Gregorio papareschi (row 6) is from Rome, elevated around 1088 or 1116.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"the elector from cream circa 1106.\" So perhaps the claim is referring to someone else? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because John of Crema was elevated in 1117, not 1106, and his elevator was paschal ii.\n\nSo, the claim states that paschal ii is the elevator for the elector from cream (crema) around 1106. But according to the table:\n\n- Elector: John of Crema\n- Nationality: crema\n- Cardinal title: cardinal - priest of s crisogono\n- Elevated: circa 1117\n- Elevator: paschal ii\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it states the elevated year as 1106, but the actual is 1117. Also, John of Crema is from crema, and his elevator was paschal ii.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the claim is correct? Let me double-check.\n\nThe claim: \"paschal ii be the elevator for the elector from cream circa 1106.\"\n\nSo, it's saying that at some point around 1106, paschal ii elevated someone from cream. However, in the table, the only person from cream is John of Crema, who was elevated in 1117 by paschal ii.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the year doesn't match (1106 vs 1117). So the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"elevator.\" Perhaps it refers to someone else? But in this context, \"elevator\" seems to mean the person who elevates them to cardinal. So in John of Crema's case, it's paschal ii.\n\nSo, the claim says that paschal ii is the elevator for the elector from cream (John) at circa 1106, which doesn't align with the actual data. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: to verify this claim, I need to look for:\n\n1. The row of the elector from cream.\n2. The column where their nationality is listed.\n3. The column where the year they were elevated is listed.\n4. The column where their elevator is listed.\n\nSo, looking at the table:\n\n- Elector: John of Crema (row 2)\n- Nationality: crema (column \"nationality\")\n- Elevated: circa 1117 (column \"elevated\")\n- Elevator: paschal ii (column \"elevator\")\n\nThus, the relevant cells are row 2 for nationality, row 2 for elevated, and row 2 for elevator.\n\nWait, but the claim is about paschal ii being the elevator for the elector from cream. So I think we need to check:\n\n- The nationalities column: look for \"crema\" to find the correct elector.\n- The elevator column for that row (row 2) should be paschal ii.\n- The elevated year in that row is circa 1117, which doesn't match 1106 as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. row_index: 2, column \"nationality\" (to find John of Crema)\n2. row_index: 2, column \"elevated\" (to see the actual year)\n3. row_index: 2, column \"elevator\" (paschal ii)\n\nSo, these cells are where the claim's correctness is verified.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether the statement \"paschal ii be the elevator for the elector from cream circa 1106\" is correct based on the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Elector from Cream:**\n   - Search for the nationality \"crema.\" This leads to John of Crema in row 2.\n\n2. **Check the Elector's Details:**\n   - **Nationality:** crema (row 2)\n   - **Cardinality and Title:** cardinal - priest of s crisogono\n   - **Elevated Year:** circa 1117\n   - **Elevator:** paschal ii\n\n3. **Analyze the Statement:**\n   - The statement claims that paschal ii was the elevator for this elector around 1106.\n   - However, according to the table, John of Crema was elevated in 1117, not 1106.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the elector from cream (John of Crema) was elevated in 1117, not 1106. The relevant cells confirming this are row 2 for nationality, row 2 for the elevated year, and row 2 for the elevator.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The statement is false.}}",
