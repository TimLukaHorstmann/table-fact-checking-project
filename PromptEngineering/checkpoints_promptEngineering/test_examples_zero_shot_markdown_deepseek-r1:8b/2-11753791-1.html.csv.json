    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is saying that any team which has exactly 3 losses also has zero ties. So for every team in the table, if their losses are equal to 3, then their number of ties should be zero.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five teams: montreal hockey club, ottawa hockey club, montreal victorias, quebec hockey club, and montreal crystals. Each has a certain number of games played, wins, losses, ties, goals for, and goals against. \n\nI need to check each team's number of losses and their number of ties. For any team with 3 losses, I have to verify if they have 0 ties.\n\nStarting with the first team: montreal hockey club. Their losses are 3. So according to the claim, their ties should be zero. Looking at the \"ties\" column for this row, it's 0. That fits, so no issue here.\n\nNext is ottawa hockey club. They have 3 losses as well. Checking their ties, it's also 0. That matches the claim too.\n\nMoving on to montreal victorias. Their losses are 3 again. Ties for this team are 0 as well. So that works with the claim.\n\nQuebec hockey club has 3 losses. However, their ties column shows 0. Wait, no, wait: looking back at the table, quebec hockey club's ties are actually 0? Let me double-check the table.\n\nWait, in the table provided:\n\n| team                 |   games played |   wins |   losses |   ties |   goals for |   goals against |\n|:---------------------|---------------:|-------:|---------:|-------:|------------:|----------------:|\n| montreal hockey club |              8 |      5 |        3 |      0 |          25 |              15 |\n| ottawa hockey club   |              8 |      5 |        3 |      0 |          24 |              16 |\n| montreal victorias   |              8 |      5 |        3 |      0 |          36 |              20 |\n| quebec hockey club   |              8 |      5 |        3 |      0 |          26 |              27 |\n| montreal crystals    |              8 |      0 |        8 |      0 |          10 |              43 |\n\nSo, all teams except montreal crystals have 3 losses and 0 ties. Now, looking at the last team: montreal crystals. They have 8 losses (since their wins are 0) but wait, in the table, for \"losses\" column, it's 8. So they don't have 3 losses, so the claim doesn't apply to them.\n\nWait a second, let me recheck that. The last team is montreal crystals: games played 8, wins 0, losses 8, ties 0. So their losses are 8, not 3. Therefore, the claim only applies to teams with exactly 3 losses.\n\nSo all four teams (first four) have 3 losses and 0 ties. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but wait again: quebec hockey club's \"ties\" is listed as 0? Let me check that. In the table, under \"ties\", quebec hockey club shows 0. So yes, they have 3 losses and 0 ties.\n\nSo all teams with 3 losses have 0 ties in this table. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that there are no other teams with different numbers of losses and ties. The only team not fitting is montreal crystals, but they don't have 3 losses. So all four teams that do have 3 losses also have 0 ties.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
