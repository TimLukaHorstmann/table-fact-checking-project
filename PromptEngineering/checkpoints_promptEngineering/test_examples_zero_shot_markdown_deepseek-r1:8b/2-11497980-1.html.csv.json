The claim is: \"model 26.260e and 31.260e have a gcm (kg) technical capacity of 42000.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"gcm\" refers to the gross cargo mass, which in this context is the maximum weight that can be carried by the vehicle. The table provided lists various models with their corresponding engine details and capacities.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: model, engine make/capacity, power (kw rpm), torque (nm rpm), gvm (kg) technical capacity, and gcm (kg) technical capacity. So, for each model listed, I can find their gcm value in the last column.\n\nNow, focusing on the models mentioned in the claim: 26.260e and 31.260e. I need to locate these two models in the table and check their respective gcm values.\n\nStarting with model 26.260e, I'll scan through each row. Let me count the rows:\n\n1. model 8.120\n2. model 8.150e\n3. model 13.170e\n4. model 13.180\n5. model 13.180e\n6. model 15.170e\n7. model 15.180\n8. model 15.180e\n9. model 17.180\n10. model 17.220\n11. model 17.250e\n12. model 24.220\n13. model 24.250e\n14. model 26.220\n15. model 26.260e\n16. model 31.260e\n\nSo, model 26.260e is at row index 15. Checking the gcm column for this row: according to the table, it's 42000 kg.\n\nNext, model 31.260e. Looking through the rows, I see that 31.260e is at row index 16. The table shows its gcm as 42000 kg as well.\n\nTherefore, both models have a gcm of 42000 kg, which matches the claim exactly. \n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of confusion with other models sharing similar numbers, but in this case, each model has a unique row, so it's straightforward.\n\nHence, the claim is true because both specified models indeed have a gcm technical capacity of 42000 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as both models 26.260e and 31.260e have a gcm of 42000kg. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the rows, I see that each row starts with the model number. The relevant row here would be the one starting with \"17.250e\". \n\nOnce I've found the correct row, I should check which columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\", so I need to find where this is in the table. Looking at the column headers, I see that there's a column named \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\".\n\nNow, for model 17.250e, what does the gcm value say? In the relevant row, under the \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\" column, it shows 35000 kg. \n\nSince this matches exactly with the claim, the information is fully supported by the table data.

The claim states: \"26.260e / 31.260e be the model with gcm (kg) technical capacity of 42000.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that both models 26.260e and 31.260e have a gcm (technical capacity) of 42,000 kg. So, my task is to check the table for these two models and verify their respective gcm values.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a specific model with various specifications. The columns include engine details, power, torque, GVM, and GCM. I need to focus on the \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\" column.\n\nI'll start by locating rows for models 26.260e and 31.260e in the table. Scanning through the list:\n\n- Model 26.220: Cummins C8.3215 P5 -0 - euro iii, GCM is 35,000.\n- Model 26.260e: MWM 6.12tcae - euro iii, GCM is 42,000.\n\nNext, model 31.260e:\n\n- Model 31.260e: MWM 6.12 tcae - euro iii, GCM is 42,000.\n\nSo both models have a GCM of 42,000 kg as per the table. However, I need to ensure that these are indeed the same models with this capacity. Wait, in the table, model 26.260e has a different engine (MWM 6.12tcae) compared to model 31.260e (MWM 6.12 tcae). Are they considered the same model? Or does the model number alone suffice?\n\nThe claim refers to \"model with gcm of 42000,\" so it's about having that capacity, regardless of other specs. Therefore, both models do have a GCM of 42,000 kg. \n\nI should verify each model's row in the table:\n\n- For 26.260e: The GCM is indeed 42,000.\n- For 31.260e: Similarly, the GCM is 42,000.\n\nThus, both models meet the condition stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that models 26.260e and 31.260e have a GCM of 42,000 kg.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"17.250e be the model with gcm (kg) technical capacity of 35000 and gvm (kg) technical capacity of 16000 and cummins interact 6.0 - euro iii (turbo intercooler) be the engine.\" \n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the models, I see that model 17.250e is present in the table. Let me find its row. Scanning through the rows: 8.120, 8.150e, 13.170e, etc., until I spot 17.250e. That's row index 14 (if we start counting from 0). Now, let's check the gcm and gvm for this model.\n\nIn the table, under \"gcm (kg) technical capacity,\" for model 17.250e, it says 35000 kg. And for \"gvm (kg) technical capacity,\" it's 16000 kg. So that part checks out: the model has the specified gcm and gvm.\n\nNext, I need to verify the engine make and details. The claim mentions \"cummins interact 6.0 - euro iii (turbo intercooler).\" Looking at the table, under model 17.250e, the engine is listed as cummins interact 6.0 - euro iii (turbo intercooler). So that matches too.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other models with the same gcm and gvm. Scanning through the table: model 24.220 has gvm 23000 and gcm 35000, which is different from 17.250e's values. Similarly, other models have either higher or lower capacities. So 17.250e is unique in having both 35000 kg gcm and 16000 kg gvm.\n\nAlso, the engine details for 17.250e exactly match the claim. No discrepancies there.\n\nSo putting it all together: the model number, the gcm, the gvm, and the engine type all align with the claim. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we checked the specified model (17.250e) against the table and confirmed that its gcm is 35000 kg and gvm is 16000 kg. Additionally, the engine details match exactly. Since all parts of the claim are supported by the table data, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gvm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"engine make / capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It has several columns: model, engine make/capacity, power (kw rpm), torque (nm rpm), gvm (kg) technical capacity, and gcm (kg) technical capacity. The claim is specifically about the \"technical capacity,\" so I should focus on the gvm and gcm columns.\n\nThe models in question are 26.260e and 31.260e. I'll need to find their respective gvm and gcm values from the table.\n\nStarting with model 26.260e: Looking through the rows, I see that the row for 26.260e has gvm as 23000 kg and gcm as 42000 kg. Wait, but the claim says \"maximum technical capacity of 41000.\" Hmm, so the claim is referring to 41,000, but model 26.260e's gvm is 23,000. That doesn't match the claim.\n\nNow checking model 31.260e: The row for 31.260e shows gvm as 23000 kg and gcm as 42000 kg. Same as 26.260e. So both models have a gvm of 23,000 kg and gcm of 42,000 kg.\n\nThe claim is stating that only these two models have the maximum technical capacity of 41,000. But looking at the table, other models like 24.220 and 24.250e also have higher gvm (23000) but their gcm is 35000, which is lower than 42000. Wait, no\u2014model 31.260e's gcm is 42,000 kg, which is the highest in the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"maximum technical capacity of 41000.\" So perhaps it's referring to either gvm or gcm? Or maybe the maximum between them? Let me re-read the claim: \"model 26.260e / 31.260e only have the maximum technical capacity of 41000.\"\n\nSo, does this mean that both models' gvm and/or gcm are at 41,000 kg? Looking back:\n\n- For model 26.260e, gvm is 23,000 and gcm is 42,000.\n- For model 31.260e, same as above.\n\nNeither of these reach 41,000; in fact, the highest I see is 42,000 for gcm in both models, but 41,000 isn't a value here. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because neither model reaches 41,000 kg in their technical capacity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to either gvm or gcm as 41,000, but in this case, it's not accurate because both have lower or higher values.\n\nWait, let me double-check the table data:\n\nLooking at model 26.260e: gvm=23000, gcm=42000.\n\nModel 31.260e: same as above.\n\nSo neither of these models has a technical capacity of 41,000 kg. Therefore, the claim is false because their maximum technical capacities are either 23,000 or 42,000 kg, not 41,000.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the table. Let me check again for model 31.260e: Yes, it's \"mwm 6.12 tcae - euro iii\" with gvm=23000 and gcm=42000.\n\nTherefore, neither model reaches 41,000 kg in either gvm or gcm. So the claim that they have a maximum technical capacity of 41,000 is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because both models have different technical capacities (23,000 and 42,000 kg) rather than 41,000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gvm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gvm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
