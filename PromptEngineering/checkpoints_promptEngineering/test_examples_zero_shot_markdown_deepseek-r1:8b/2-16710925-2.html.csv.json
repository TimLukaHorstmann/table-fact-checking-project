    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"On September 26, 1971, the attendance at the game was 57,895 crowd.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see what information it has. The table lists games from week 1 to week 14, each with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nI need to find the specific row that corresponds to September 26, 1971. Scanning through the 'date' column, I see that week 2 is on September 26, 1971. That's the relevant row for this claim.\n\nNext, I check the 'attendance' column for that particular week. The attendance listed is 57,895. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nSo, both the date and the attendance figure in week 2 align perfectly with the claim. There are no discrepancies here. Therefore, the claim should be considered TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the game on September 26, 1971. The table shows that in Week 2 of that date, the attendance was indeed 57,895.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"week 14 be on september 26 , 1971 and the attendance be 57895\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the week number (week 14) being on September 26, 1971, and the second part relates to the attendance figure being 57,895.\n\nI should look at each row in the table to check if any matches both conditions for week 14 and the specified date and attendance. Let me go through each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. I need to find a row where the week is 14, the date is September 26, 1971, and the attendance is 57,895.\n\nLet's start with week 14. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Week 1: Sept 19\n- Week 2: Sept 26\n- Week 3: Oct 3\n- ...\n- Week 14: Dec 19\n\nWait a minute, week 14 is on December 19, 1971, not September 26. So that's already a discrepancy. The claim says week 14 should be on Sept 26, but according to the table, it's actually in early December.\n\nSince the date doesn't match, I don't need to check further because both conditions have to be true for the claim to hold. However, since the date is wrong, the attendance figure might still be relevant if the week 14 row exists, but in this case, the week number and date are mismatched.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that on September 26, week 14 occurred? But looking at the table, the weeks progress in order: weeks increase as the dates go from Sept to Dec. So week 1 is earliest, then each subsequent week follows. Therefore, week 14 would be the last one, which is December 19.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly associates week 14 with September 26, which isn't accurate based on the table.\n\nAdditionally, even if I check the attendance for week 14, since it's not on Sept 26 but Dec 19, the attendance figure of 57,895 doesn't correspond to that week. Let me verify: in week 14, the attendance is listed as 75,954, not 57,895.\n\nSo both conditions are incorrect. However, the task is to check each condition and see if they're supported by the table cells.\n\nThe claim has two specific conditions:\n1. Week 14 on Sept 26, 1971\n2. Attendance of 57,895\n\nLooking at the table, there's no row with week 14 on Sept 26. The only week 14 is on Dec 19. Therefore, the first condition fails.\n\nSimilarly, checking for attendance of 57,895: looking through all rows:\n\n- Week 2 has attendance 57,895.\n\nSo if the claim were about week 2 having that attendance, it would be TRUE, but here the claim links it to week 14, which is incorrect.\n\nHence, since both conditions are not met for the same row, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates week 14 with September 26 and an incorrect attendance figure. The relevant cells are checked, confirming neither condition holds.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
