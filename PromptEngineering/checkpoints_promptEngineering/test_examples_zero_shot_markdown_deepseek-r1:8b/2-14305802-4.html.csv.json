    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977 - 78 season to the los angeles king.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components.\n\n1. **Team**: Philadelphia Flyer\n2. **Game Number**: 22nd game\n3. **Season**: 1977-78\n4. **Opponent**: Los Angeles Kings\n5. **Outcome**: Loss\n\nNow, looking at the table provided:\n\nThe table has columns: game, december, opponent, score, record, points.\n\nI need to find the row where:\n- The game number is 22.\n- The opponent is Los Angeles Kings.\n- The team in question is Philadelphia Flyer. Wait, looking at the table, I don't see a column for the home team. Hmm, that's an issue because without knowing who played at home, it's unclear.\n\nWait, the table lists the opponent, but not the home team. So if game 22 was between two teams, one of which is the Los Angeles Kings, but unless we know the other team, we can't confirm whether the Philadelphia Flyer lost or not.\n\nLooking at row 22:\n\n- Game: 22\n- Opponent: Los Angeles Kings\n- Score: 4 - 2 (I assume this is the score for the Flyers)\nBut wait, without knowing if it's a home game or away, the opponent could be either team. So if Philadelphia Flyer lost to Los Angeles Kings in game 22, that would mean they were at home? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't list home and away, so we need more information. Alternatively, perhaps the opponent is always the visiting team or something else. But from the table, it's unclear.\n\nIn row 22, the score is 4-2, which could mean Philadelphia scored 4 and lost to Los Angeles Kings with 2 goals. Or vice versa, but usually, in sports tables, the first team listed is the home team, so perhaps 4-2 means Flyers scored 4, Kings scored 2, so Flyers won.\n\nBut that contradicts the claim, which says Flyers lost. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the table might list the opponent as the away team, and the home team is not specified. So in row 22, the game was played against Los Angeles Kings, who are the away team, and scored 2 goals, while the home team (maybe Flyers) scored 4, leading to a Flyers win.\n\nBut the claim says Flyers lost to Kings, so that would mean the score should be something like Kings scoring more. However, in row 22, it's 4-2, which seems like Flyers won.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table structure. Maybe the score is for the opponent, but that doesn't make sense because usually, the home team's score comes first.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nIn row 22:\nopponent: Los Angeles Kings\nscore: 4 - 2\n\nIf the score is in the format of Home - Away, then 4-2 would mean Flyers scored 4 and Kings scored 2, so Flyers won. But that contradicts the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists the opponent's score first. So if it's 4 - 2, perhaps that's Kings' score. Then, if the Flyer lost, their own score would be lower.\n\nBut without knowing who is the home team, it's ambiguous. Since the table doesn't specify, I can't confirm whether the Flyers were at home or away in game 22.\n\nTherefore, there's insufficient information to verify the claim because we don't know if the Flyers were the home team or not in that game. Without that info, we can't determine if they lost.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"the cleveland baron score no point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify if there's a match between the Cleveland Barons and the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st in any of the games listed.\n\nI'll start by examining each row for the game number. The claim mentions \"cleveland baron,\" which matches the team name in some rows: specifically, rows 5 (game 27) and 8 (game 32).\n\nNext, I need to check when these games took place. For game 27, the December value is 11. That would be around December 11th. Game 32's December value is 23, which likely refers to December 23rd.\n\nNow, looking at both relevant games: none of them are on December 21st. The closest dates are December 11 and December 23, which don't align with the claim's date of December 21.\n\nAdditionally, checking other columns like opponent for these rows shows that in game 27, the Cleveland Barons played against the Chicago Black Hawks, and in game 32, they faced the New York Rangers. The Flyers aren't listed as opponents in any relevant games on those dates.\n\nTherefore, since there's no game where Cleveland Barons faced Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win the 24th and 25th game of the season against the new york ranger.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's saying. It mentions the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers winning their 24th and 25th games against the New York Rangers. So, I need to look for games where the Flyers played against the Rangers in those specific game numbers (24 and 25) during that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with the following columns: game number, December value, opponent, score, record, and points. The opponent column is important here because we're focusing on games against the New York Rangers.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row to check if any match the criteria:\n\n- Row 22: Opponent is Los Angeles Kings.\n- Row 23: Opponent is Colorado Rockies.\n- Row 24: Opponent is New York Rangers. So, game 24 is against the Rangers.\n- Row 25: Opponent is New York Rangers as well. Game 25 is also against them.\n\nWait a minute, so both game 24 and 25 are against the New York Rangers. But according to the claim, it's about Philadelphia Flyers winning those games. However, in the table, the team isn't specified\u2014it just lists the opponents. So I need to confirm which team is playing as the home team.\n\nIn hockey, typically, each game has a home and away designation. The opponent column doesn't specify whether it's the Flyers or Rangers; it only shows who they're playing against. So I need to figure out if in games 24 and 25, the Flyers are playing away or home.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't provide information about which team is the home team for each game. It just lists the opponent. Without that data, it's hard to determine whether the Flyers won those specific games. So perhaps I'm missing some information here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'game' column refers to the game number in the season, and the team is implied as the Flyers because they're playing against the Rangers. But that might not be accurate since both teams could have their own game numbers. However, looking at the opponents listed, for example, in row 24, opponent is New York Rangers, so maybe it's safe to assume that this is the Flyers' game.\n\nWait, but without knowing whether the Flyers are playing home or away, we can't confirm if they won those games because a team's performance varies depending on venue. So perhaps I need more information about which team is the visitor and which is the home team for each game.\n\nBut since the table doesn't provide that detail, maybe I'm supposed to assume that whenever a team plays against another, it's them as the home or away. Alternatively, perhaps the table is structured such that the 'game' column refers to the Flyers' game numbers. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column, in row 24 and 25, it's New York Rangers both times. So if these are games where the Flyers played against the Rangers, then maybe those are indeed the games the Flyers won. But without knowing who hosted, I can't be certain about the outcome based on the table.\n\nWait, but the 'score' column shows that in game 24, the score is 3-3, and in game 25, it's 7-4. So if those are the scores for the Flyers, then they would have tied and won respectively. However, without knowing which team is the home or away, I can't confirm whether these are wins for the Flyers.\n\nWait, no, the 'score' is probably in the format of goals for - goals against. But since it's listed as \"3-3\" and \"7-4\", that would mean the Flyers scored 3 and allowed 3, leading to a tie, and scored 7 and allowed 4, leading to a win.\n\nBut without knowing which team is at home, I can't be sure if those are wins for the Flyers or against them. So perhaps this isn't enough information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the context of the table, each row represents a game where the Flyers are playing away, so opponents like New York Rangers would mean that the game was played in New York. But again, without knowing that, it's unclear.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the instruction is to check the relevant cells based on the claim. The claim specifies that the Flyers won games 24 and 25 against the Rangers. So I need to find in the table if those two games exist where the opponent is Rangers, and perhaps the score reflects a win.\n\nLooking at game 24: opponent is NY Rangers, score 3-3. That's a tie, so not a win.\nGame 25: opponent is NY Rangers, score 7-4. That's a win for the Flyers (assuming it's their score). So if both games are against the Rangers and those scores are Flyers' scores, then perhaps they did win game 25 but tied game 24.\n\nBut the claim says \"win the 24th and 25th game,\" implying that both were wins. But in reality, game 24 was a tie, so it's not a win. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, the claim says they won both games 24 and 25 against the Rangers. So if game 24 was a tie, then the Flyers didn't win that one, making the claim FALSE.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding the 'score' column. Maybe it's the opponent's score first. For example, in row 22: opponent is LA Kings, score 4-2. If that's the opponent's goals against the Flyers, then the Flyers would have scored 2 and allowed 4. But that would mean they lost 4-2. Wait, no, the way scores work, it's usually presented as home team's goals first.\n\nBut without knowing which is home or away, I can't tell for sure whether the score reflects a win or loss for the Flyers. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this table, each game represents a home game for the Flyers, and their opponent is listed. So if in games 24 and 25 against NY Rangers, the Flyers won both, that would make sense.\n\nLooking at row 24: score 3-3. If that's the Flyers' goals versus the opponents', then it's a tie.\nRow 25: 7-4, which is a win.\n\nSo the claim says they won both games, but game 24 was a tie, so the claim is incorrect, making it FALSE.\n\nBut I'm not sure because without knowing who is home or away, I can't confirm whether those are wins for the Flyers. Maybe the table assumes that each game listed is a home game for the Flyers, which would mean they're playing against opponents like Rangers at their own rink.\n\nIn that case, if they scored 3 and tied 3, then it's a tie, not a win. Similarly, scoring 7-4 would be a win.\n\nSo the claim that the Flyers won both game 24 and 25 is incorrect because game 24 was a tie, so only game 25 was a win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this table, each game listed is a road game for the Flyers against opponents. So if they scored 3-3, that would mean they tied on the road, and 7-4 would be a win on the road.\n\nEither way, the claim says they won both, which isn't accurate because one was a tie. Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Philadelphia Flyers won both game 24 and 25 against the New York Rangers is incorrect. According to the provided table, while the Flyers did win game 25 with a score of 7-4, game 24 ended in a tie (3-3). Therefore, they did not win both games as stated.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because the Flyers tied game 24 and won game 25.",

Let's break down the claim: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win by 3 point against the minnesota north star\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are game number, December (I'm not sure what this refers to\u2014maybe the month or something else?), opponent, score, record, and points. Each row represents a different game, with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Philadelphia Flyer\" winning against \"Minnesota North Star\". Looking at the table, I need to find if there's any game where the opponent is Minnesota North Stars, and the Flyer won by 3 points.\n\nWait, in the table, the opponents listed are teams like los angeles kings, colorado rockies, new york rangers, etc. Scanning through them, I don't see \"Minnesota North Star\" as an opponent. The closest might be \"montreal canadiens\", but that's different. So maybe there isn't a game in this table where the Flyer plays against the Minnesota North Stars.\n\nIf that's the case, then the claim is false because there's no evidence of such a game in the table provided. Alternatively, if \"December\" refers to the month, perhaps it's looking for games played in December 1977 or 1978. But without knowing exactly when these games took place, it's hard to say. However, based on the opponents listed, there's no match against Minnesota North Stars.\n\nAlso, the score part: the claim mentions a win by 3 points. Looking at the table, scores are like \"4 - 2\", which might be goals for and against or something similar. I'm not sure if a 3-point win is standard in hockey, but regardless, without a game against Minnesota North Stars, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo, putting it together: since there's no game in the table where Philadelphia Flyer plays against Minnesota North Star and wins by 3 points, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific game involving the Philadelphia Flyers against the Minnesota North Stars with a score of 3-0.

The claim is: \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977 - 78 season to the colorado rockies.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are: game, december (probably a date or month?), opponent, score, record, and points.\n\nThe key elements in the claim are:\n\n1. Philadelphia Flyer\n2. They lose a specific game, the 22nd.\n3. Opponent is Colorado Rockies.\n4. Season is 1977-78.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for game 22.

So that's a problem. The claim says they lost to Colorado Rockies, but according to the table, they played against Los Angeles Kings in game 22.\n\nAlso, checking for the Flyer's opponent: in row 23, it's Colorado Rockies, but that's a different game.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer lose by 5 point to the boston bruin.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. It mentions a specific season (1977-78), the Philadelphia Flyers team losing to the Boston Bruins. They lost by 5 points.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list games from game 22 to 35, with details like the date in December, opponent teams, score, record, and points. I'm guessing each row represents a game played by the Philadelphia Flyers (since the opponents are various NHL teams).\n\nI need to identify which cells in the table are relevant to verify this claim. Let me break down the claim:\n\n1. Season: 1977-78\n2. Team: Philadelphia Flyers\n3. Opponent: Boston Bruins\n4. Result: Loss by 5 points\n\nNow, checking the table, I see that each game is numbered from 22 to 35, and the dates in December suggest these are the early games of the season.\n\nLooking for the opponent being the Boston Bruins, I can scan through the \"opponent\" column:\n\n- Game 24: New York Rangers\n- Game 28: Boston Bruins\n- Game 32: Boston Bruins\n\nSo, game numbers 28 and 32 have the Boston Bruins as the opponent.\n\nNow, for each of these games, let's check if the Flyers lost by 5 points. The \"score\" column has values like \"4 - 2\", \"6 - 3\", etc. I think this might represent the goals scored by each team in the game. But since it's a loss, the Flyers would have fewer goals.\n\nHowever, the \"points\" column shows numbers like 44, 48, etc., which probably represents the total points accumulated up to that game or something else. Wait, maybe \"points\" here is the team's point total after the game? Or perhaps it's the score in terms of points, not goals.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table headers: \"score\" and \"record.\" The \"score\" might be the final score of the game (e.g., 4-2 means Flyers scored 4, opponent scored 2). The \"record\" probably refers to wins, losses, ties so far in the season.\n\nBut the \"points\" column is a separate number. It might represent points earned in that game or total points for the season up to that point.\n\nIn any case, since we're looking for a loss by 5 points, I need to see if any of the games against the Bruins resulted in a Flyers' loss where they were down by exactly 5 points.\n\nLooking at game 28: opponent is Boston Bruins. The score is \"6 - 4.\" So the Flyers scored 6, Bruins scored 4. But that's a win for Flyers, not a loss. So that can't be it.\n\nNext, game 32: opponent is Boston Bruins again. Score is \"1 - 6.\" So Flyers scored 1, Bruins scored 6. That's a loss, but by how many points? The difference in goals is 5 (6-1=5). But the claim says they lost by 5 points. Wait, does that mean points or goal differential?\n\nIf it's about the goal differential, then 6-1=5, so yes, they lost by 5 points in terms of goals. However, the \"points\" column for game 32 is 48.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the \"score\" and \"points\" columns are separate. Maybe \"points\" refers to something else, like team points in the game or overall. But if we're talking about goal differential, then it's 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"points\" column is cumulative, so game 32 would be the Flyers' total points up to that game. Let me check: \n\nLooking at game 24, the Flyers have 36 points.\nGame 28: 44\nGame 30: 46\nGame 31:48\nGame 32:48\n\nWait, but in game 32, the score is 1-6, which seems like a big loss, and yet their total points are still 48. Maybe that's after multiple games.\n\nBut the key here is whether they lost by 5 points. If we consider goal differential as 5 ( Bruins scored 6, Flyers 1), then yes. But if it's about point differential in terms of season points, maybe not.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lose by 5 point,\" which could be a translation issue and might mean they lost by 5 goals. So in game 32, the difference is 5 goals (6-1=5), so that matches.\n\nBut looking back at the table, I see that the points column for game 32 is 48. Let me check if any other game against Bruins resulted in a loss with a differential of exactly 5.\n\nWait, game 24: score is 3-3 (Flyers didn't lose). Game 28: Flyers won. Game 32: lost by 5 goals. So that's the only game where they lost to Bruins by 5 goals.\n\nSo, in this case, the relevant cells would be game 32, columns \"opponent\" and \"score,\" and possibly \"points.\"\n\nBut wait, the claim says they lost by 5 points, not necessarily 5 goals. Maybe it refers to total points in the game? But I don't think so because the score is usually about goals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about point differential in the season standings, but that seems less likely since the \"record\" is separate.\n\nWait, looking at the table again: for each game, there's a date (December something), opponent, score, record, and points. The \"score\" is probably the goals scored by each team. So the difference would be in the score, not necessarily the \"points\" column.\n\nSo, if we're considering that they lost by 5 points, it's about the goal differential of 5 in that game.\n\nTherefore, looking for the cell where opponent is Bruins and score has a differential of 5 goals.\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n- Game 28: Flyers scored 6, Bruins 4 \u2192 difference +2 (Flyers win)\n- Game 32: Flyers 1, Bruins 6 \u2192 difference -5 (Flyers lose by 5)\n\nThat's the only one. So the relevant columns are opponent and score for game 32.\n\nBut the question is about being \"tasked to find which cells are relevant.\" So the key information needed is that in game 32 against Bruins, they lost with a goal differential of 5.\n\nSo, the specific cells would be:\n\n- Opponent: Boston Bruins\n- Score: 1 - 6 (Flyers scored 1, opponents 6)\n- Points: 48\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"points\" is necessary or just \"score.\" The claim says \"lost by 5 points,\" which could refer to goals, so maybe the score.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are game number 32 (though the task might be to find the specific numbers in those columns), opponent, and the score showing a difference of 5.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to identify which cells contain information about the Flyers losing to the Bruins by five points. Based on the analysis:\n\n- **Game Number**: 32\n- **Opponent**: Boston Bruins\n- **Score**: The Flyers scored 1 goal, and the Bruins scored 6 goals (difference of 5 goals).\n- **Points**: 48\n\nThese cells provide confirmation that the Flyers lost to the Bruins by five points.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Game #: 32\n- Opponent: Boston Bruins\n- Score: 1 - 6\n- Points: 48",

So there's no game 21 in this table.\n\nIf there's no game with the Philadelphia Flyers as the opponent on December 21st, then the claim can't be true because such a game doesn't exist. Alternatively, if game 21 exists but it's not in the table provided, that would mean the claim is false.\n\nAlso, even if the game existed and was in the table, I'd need to check if the Cleveland Baron scored more points than any other team against them on that date. But since the Flyers aren't listed as opponents, there's no data point relevant to this claim.\n</think>\n\nThe table provided does not contain a game where the opponent is the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers. Additionally, December 21st corresponds to game number 21, which isn't present in the given data. Without such a game entry, it's impossible for the Cleveland Baron to have faced them on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win most of the game of the season against the new york ranger.\" So, I need to determine if the Philadelphia Flyers won the majority of their games against the New York Rangers during the 1977-78 season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game. The columns are: game number, date in December, opponent, score (in the form of goals-for and goals-against), record, and points.\n\nI notice that the opponents listed include teams like the New York Rangers. So, I need to find all games where the opponent is the New York Rangers and then check if the Flyers won most of those games.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 22: Opponent is Los Angeles Kings. Not relevant.\n2. Game 23: Opponent is Colorado Rockies. Not relevant.\n3. Game 24: Opponent is New York Rangers. Let's note this game.\n4. Game 25: Opponent is New York Rangers again.\n5. Game 26: Opponent is Chicago Black Hawks. Not relevant.\n6. Game 27: Opponent is Cleveland Barons. Not relevant.\n7. Game 28: Opponent is Boston Bruins. Not relevant.\n8. Game 29: Opponent is Atlanta Flames. Not relevant.\n9. Game 30: Opponent is Montreal Canadiens. Not relevant.\n10. Game 31: Opponent is Cleveland Barons. Not relevant.\n11. Game 32: Opponent is Boston Bruins. Not relevant.\n12. Game 33: Opponent is New York Rangers. Another game against the Rangers.\n13. Game 34: Opponent is Minnesota North Stars. Not relevant.\n14. Game 35: Opponent is St Louis Blues. Not relevant.\n\nSo, from this table, there are only two games where the Philadelphia Flyers played against the New York Rangers: Game 24 and Game 33.\n\nLooking at the scores:\n\n- Game 24: Score is 3 - 3. That's a tie.\n- Game 33: Score is 4 - 3 in favor of the Flyers.\n\nWait, but the claim says they \"won most of the games.\" Let me count how many times they played against the Rangers and their results.\n\nFrom the table, only two games are against the Rangers. In one game (Game 24), it's a tie, and in the other (Game 33), they won. So out of two games, they have one win and one tie. That means they didn't win both, so they didn't win most of them.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to ensure there aren't more games against the Rangers that are not listed here. The table goes up to Game 35, but perhaps the season is longer? However, based on the data given, only two games are against the Rangers.\n\nSince they have one win and one tie, it's not a majority of wins. A majority would require more than half, which in two games would mean at least two wins. Since they have only one win, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I'm miscounting. The table lists each game with an opponent. It's possible that the season includes more games against the Rangers not captured here, but based on the provided data, there are only two such games.\n\nTherefore, the Flyers didn't win most of their games against the Rangers in the 1977-78 season as per the given data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we analyze the table for games between Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers. Only two games are identified with one win and one tie.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win by 3 point against the boston bruin\". \n\nFirst, I'll start by breaking down the claim into its components. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The team: Philadelphia Flyer\n2. The season: 1977-78\n3. The opponent: Boston Bruins\n4. The result: win by 3 points\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details like the date in December, opponent, score, record, and points. The columns are game number, december (date), opponent, score, record, and points.\n\nI need to check if there's a game where:\n\n- The home team is Philadelphia Flyer.\n- The season is during December 1977 or 1978? Wait, the table doesn't specify the year beyond the game numbers. But since it's a hockey season, typically each season corresponds to a specific set of games, so perhaps I need to see if any row lists Philadelphia Flyer as the opponent against Boston Bruins with a win by 3 points.\n\nWait, but looking at the table provided, the opponents listed are:\n\n- Los Angeles Kings\n- Colorado Rockies\n- New York Rangers\n- New York Rangers again\n- Chicago Black Hawks\n- Cleveland Barons\n- Boston Bruins\n- Atlanta Flames\n- Montreal Canadiens\n- Cleveland Barons again\n- New York Rangers again\n- Minnesota North Stars\n- St Louis Blues\n\nI don't see Philadelphia Flyer listed as an opponent in any of the games. That's a problem because the claim mentions them as the team winning against Boston Bruins.\n\nSo, the first red flag is that Philadelphia Flyer isn't even listed as an opponent. Therefore, there can't be a game where they play against Boston Bruins based on this table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misreading something. Let me check each row's opponent:\n\nRow 22: Los Angeles Kings\nRow23: Colorado Rockies\nRow24: New York Rangers\nRow25: New York Rangers\nRow26: Chicago Black Hawks\nRow27: Cleveland Barons\nRow28: Boston Bruins\nRow29: Atlanta Flames\nRow30: Montreal Canadiens\nRow31: Cleveland Barons\nRow32: Boston Bruins\nRow33: New York Rangers\nRow34: Minnesota North Stars\nRow35: St Louis Blues\n\nYes, the opponents are as above. So Philadelphia Flyer isn't present here. That means there's no game in this table where Philadelphia Flyer plays against Boston Bruins.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be FALSE because such a game doesn't exist in the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions a game involving the Philadelphia Flyers against the Boston Bruins during the 1977-78 season, but the table does not list any games with the Philadelphia Flyers as opponents. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer lose by 3 point to the boston bruin\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It mentions a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Boston Bruins during the 1977-78 season where the Flyers lost by 3 points. So, my goal is to find a matching game in the provided table that satisfies these conditions: it's a Philadelphia Flyers game, it's in the 1977-78 season, and they lost by 3 points against the Boston Bruins.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row corresponds to a specific game number (from 22 to 35), with details like the opponent, score, record, and points. The \"game\" column doesn't explicitly mention the season, but given that this is a single table, it's likely representing one particular season. However, since the claim refers to the 1977-78 season, I need to confirm if the games in the table fall within that timeframe.\n\nWait, the table might not have all the necessary information about the season. Each row has a \"game\" number and an opponent. For example, game 22 is against the Los Angeles Kings, game 23 against the Colorado Rockies, etc., up to game 35 against the St. Louis Blues. The opponents listed include teams like the Bruins, Rangers, Blackhawks, Flames, Canadiens, Barons, etc.\n\nNow, looking for games involving the Boston Bruins: in row 24, the opponent is the New York Rangers; row 28 is vs. Atlanta Flames; row 30 vs. Montreal Canadiens; row 32 vs. Boston Bruins (so that's a game where Flyers lost 1-6), and row 34 is against Minnesota North Stars.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the \"opponent\" for game number 32 is Boston Bruins, so let me check what the score was for that game. The score column says 1 - 6, which means the Flyers scored 1 goal and lost by 5 goals, not 3 points. So that's not the game.\n\nBut in the table, there are no games where the Flyers play against the Bruins with a loss of 3 points. Let me check all the rows again. Looking through each row:\n\n- Game 22: Opponent Kings, score 4-2 (Flyers win)\n- Game23: Rockies, 6-3 (win)\n- Game24: Rangers, 3-3 (tie)\n- Game25: Rangers, 7-4 (win)\n- Game26: Blackhawks, 4-2 (win)\n- Game27: Barons, 11-1 (win)\n- Game28: Bruins, 6-4 (Flyers win)\n- Game29: Flames, 4-3 (Flyers win)\n- Game30: Canadiens, 0-2 (lose by 2 goals)\n- Game31: Barons, 4-0 (win)\n- Game32: Bruins, 1-6 (lose by 5 goals)\n- Game33: Rangers, 4-3 (Flyers win)\n- Game34: North Stars, 5-2 (win)\n- Game35: Blues, 2-3 (Flyers lose by 1 goal)\n\nSo in none of these games do the Flyers lose to the Bruins by 3 points. The closest is game 32 where they lost 1-6, which is a 5-point loss. Therefore, the claim seems false based on the table provided.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the \"points\" column. The \"score\" is given as goals for and against, like 4 - 2, meaning Flyers scored 4, opponents scored 2. Then \"points\" could be total points earned in the game, perhaps? Or is it related to something else?\n\nWait no, looking back at the columns: \"score\" seems to represent the goal difference (e.g., 4-2 means Flyers scored more). The \"record\" column looks like their overall season record up to that point. So \"points\" might be the total points accumulated in the games played so far.\n\nBut regardless of the interpretation, the claim is about a specific game outcome: losing by 3 points against the Bruins. From the table, I don't see any such game where Flyers lost to Bruins with a 3-point margin. They either won, tied, or lost by more than 3 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe table provided does not contain a game where the Philadelphia Flyers lose to the Boston Bruins by 3 points during the 1977-78 season. After examining each relevant row, no such match is found.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
