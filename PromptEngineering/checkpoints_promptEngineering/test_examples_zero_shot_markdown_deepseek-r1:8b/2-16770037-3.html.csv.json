Looking at the table, each row represents a different team. The third row is \"dinamo - bucure\u015fti\".\n\nIn that row, there are several columns: tries for, tries against, try diff, points for, points against, points diff. \n\nThe claim mentions two specific figures: tries against should be 32 and points against should be 213. So I need to check these two columns in the relevant row.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"tries against\" for dinamo - bucure\u015fti, it's written as 32. And under \"points against\", it says 213. Both numbers match exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, both conditions are met. That means the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant: the row index for dinamo - bucure\u015fti is 2 (since it's the third row but indexing starts at 0).

Each row represents a different team with their respective statistics in these categories.\n\nThe claim is: \"for narbonne , the tries against be 6 , and the try diff be + 15.\" So I need to check if Narbonne has exactly 6 tries against and a try differential of +15.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find Narbonne's row. Scanning through the team names, I see Narbonne is the second row in the table. Now, focusing on the relevant columns for the claim: tries against and try diff.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Tries against for Narbonne is 6.\n- Try diff is +15.\n\nSo both conditions are met exactly as stated in the claim. The tries against is indeed 6, and the try differential is +15.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"for narbonne, the tries for be 21 , and the tries against be 6.\" So I'm looking at two specific pieces of information related to Narbonne in the table. \n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to Narbonne in the table. Let me scan through each team name:\n\n1. Castres Olympique\n2. Narbonne\n3. Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti\n4. Bridgend\n5. Bristol Shoguns\n6. Treorchy\n\nYes, Narbonne is the second row with index 1.\n\nNext, I need to check the relevant columns for tries. The claim mentions \"tries for\" and \"tries against,\" so these are the first two columns in each row: 'tries for' and 'tries against'.\n\nLooking at Narbonne's row (row index 1), let me extract those values:\n\n- Tries for: 21\n- Tries against: 6\n\nThe claim exactly matches these numbers. There's no discrepancy or variation; the tries for is indeed 21, and tries against is 6.\n\nNow, to make sure I'm following the instructions correctly, I should note down which cells are relevant. Each row has multiple columns, but only 'tries for' and 'tries against' are mentioned in the claim. So the relevant cells would be the second and third columns in Narbonne's row.\n\nBut wait, according to the table structure, the columns are:\n\n- team\n- tries for\n- tries against\n- try diff\n- points for\n- points against\n\nSo for Narbonne (row index 1), the 'tries for' column is at position 2 and 'tries against' at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 1, column name \"tries for\"\n- Row index 1, column name \"tries against\"\n\nI need to make sure that these are included in the \"relevant_cells\" list as specified.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. The user mentioned: \"for narbonne , the try diff be + 15 , and the point diff be + 71.\" So I need to check two things for Narbonne in the table: their try differential and their points differential.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team. The columns are \"team,\" \"tries for,\" \"tries against,\" \"try diff,\" \"points for,\" \"points against,\" and \"points diff.\" \n\nI'll focus on the row where the team is Narbonne. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. The first row after headers is Castres Olympique.\n2. Second row: Narbonne.\n3. Third: Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti.\n4. Fourth: Bridgend.\n5. Fifth: Bristol Shoguns.\n6. Sixth: Treorchy.\n\nSo Narbonne is the second row, which I'll consider as row_index 1 (since we start counting from 0). Now, looking at the columns relevant to the claim: \"try diff\" and \"points diff.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- For try diff: It's listed as +15.\n- For points diff: It's listed as +71.\n\nThe claim states that both these values are correct for Narbonne. Since both match exactly, it seems the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells in the table are relevant. Each cell corresponds to a row and column. So:\n\nFor try diff (third column), in Narbonne's row (row_index 1), the column name is \"try diff.\" Similarly, for points diff (last column), it's also in row_index 1 with column name \"points diff.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"try diff\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points diff\"}\n\nI think that covers all necessary checks.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"tries against be 32 when point against be 213\". I think it means that for a team, when their tries against is 32, their points against should be 213. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that in a particular row, both these numbers exist together. So I need to find if any team has exactly 32 tries against and exactly 213 points against.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team with various statistics. The columns involved here are \"tries against\" and \"points against\". My task is to check for each team whether their \"tries against\" equals 32 and their \"points against\" equals 213.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Castres Olympique: Tries against = 6, Points against = 71 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n2. Narbonne: Tries against = 6, Points against = 90 \u2192 No match.\n3. Dinamo - bucure\u015fti: Tries against = 32, Points against = 213 \u2192 This matches exactly the claim's numbers.\n4. Bridgend: Tries against =14, Points against=120\u2192No match.\n5. Bristol Shoguns: tries=12, points=99\u2192No.\n6. Treorchy: tries=23, points=178\u2192No.\n\nSo only Dinamo - bucure\u015fti has both 32 tries against and 213 points against. That means the claim is TRUE because there's a row where \"tries against\" is 32 when \"points against\" is 213.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones under \"tries against\" and \"points against\" for Dinamo - bucure\u015fti. Looking at the table:\n\n- For Dinamo - bucure\u015fti, row index is 2 (since it's zero-indexed).\n- The column names are \"tries against\" and \"points against\".\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 2, column_name: tries against\n- Row index 2, column_name: points against\n\nI should list these two as the relevant_cells in the JSON.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Dinamo - bucure\u015fti has both 32 tries against and 213 points against.

My task is to check each row in the table to see if any match these numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: team name, tries for, tries against, try diff, points for, points against, and points diff. The relevant columns here are \"tries for\" and \"tries against.\" I need to check each row to see if any have 21 in the \"tries for\" column and 6 in the \"tries against\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Castres Olympique**: Tries for = 29, tries against = 6. Hmm, their tries against is 6, which matches part of the claim, but their tries for is 29, not 21. So this doesn't fit exactly, but maybe there's another team that does.\n\n2. **Narbonne**: Tries for = 21, tries against = 6. Oh, wait, here we go. This row has exactly the numbers mentioned in the claim: 21 tries for and 6 tries against. That seems to match perfectly.\n\n3. **Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti**: Tries for =12, tries against=32.

Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"6 be tries against , when tries for be 21 and point diff be 171.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing with all the \"be\" and structure, but I think it's trying to say that there is a row in the table where the number of tries against is 6, and the tries for is 21, along with a points difference of 171. Wait, actually, looking closer, maybe it's phrased as when (tries for) is 21 and point diff is 171, then (tries against) is 6? That might make more sense.\n\nSo I need to look at each row in the table and check if any row has tries for of 21, points difference of 171, and tries against of 6. Let's go through each team one by one.\n\n1. **Castres Olympique**: Tries for = 29, Tries against = 6. Points diff is +136. So tries against is 6 here, but tries for isn't 21, it's 29, and points diff is 136, not 171.\n\n2. **Narbonne**: Tries for = 21, Tries against = 6. Points diff is +71. Okay, this row has tries for as 21, which matches the claim, tries against as 6, which also matches, but what about points difference? It's 71 here, not 171. So while two of the three conditions are met, the third isn't.\n\n3. **Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti**: Tries for = 12, Tries against =32. Points diff is +104. Doesn't match at all.\n\n4. **Bridgend**: Tries for=10, tries against=14. Points diff=26. No match.\n\n5. **Bristol Shoguns**: Tries for=11, tries against=12. Points diff=+29. No.\n\n6. **Treorchy**: Tries for=10, tries against=23. Points diff=106. Nope.\n\nLooking at the table, only Narbonne has tries for 21 and tries against 6, but its points difference is +71, not 171. So does this satisfy the claim? The claim says when (tries for) is 21 and (points diff) is 171, then (tries against) is 6. But in reality, Narbonne has 21 tries for, 6 tries against, but points diff of 71, not 171.\n\nWait, maybe I'm interpreting the claim incorrectly. Let me parse it again: \"6 be tries against , when tries for be 21 and point diff be 171.\" Maybe it's stating that for a team, they have 6 tries against, along with tries for being 21 and points diff being 171. But looking at the table, no team has all three of those numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that when (tries for) is 21 and points diff is 171, then tries against is 6. But in the table, there's no such row where both tries for is 21 and points diff is 171. The only row with tries for 21 is Narbonne, which has a points diff of +71.\n\nSo none of the teams have all three: tries against=6, tries for=21, and points diff=171.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"try diff be +15 when point against be 120.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand each part of the claim. It mentions two specific values that should align for a certain team: a try differential (+15) and points against being 120. So I need to look for a row where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related here would be \"try diff\" and \"points against\". The other columns like \"team\", \"tries for\", \"tries against\", \"points for\" might not be directly relevant unless needed for verification, but according to the instructions, I should only consider the specific cells mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo I'll focus on each row one by one. Let's go through each team:\n\n1. **Castres Olympique**: \n   - Try diff: +23\n   - Points against: 71\n   - Neither condition matches the claim. So not relevant.\n\n2. **Narbonne**:\n   - Try diff: +15\n   - Points against: 90\n   - Here, try diff is +15 which matches part of the claim. But points against are 90, not 120. So this row partially meets the condition but doesn't fully satisfy it.\n\n3. **Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti**:\n   - Try diff: 20\n   - Points against: 213\n   - Neither value matches, so not relevant.\n\n4. **Bridgend**:\n   - Try diff: 4\n   - Points against: 120\n   - Points against here are 120, which is what the claim mentions. But try diff is only +4, not +15. So again, partial but not full match.\n\n5. **Bristol Shoguns**:\n   - Try diff: +1\n   - Points against: 99\n   - Doesn't meet either condition.\n\n6. **Treorchy**:\n   - Try diff: +13\n   - Points against: 178\n   - Neither matches the claim's values.\n\nFrom this, only Narbonne and Bridgend have points against at 90 or 120 respectively, but only Bridgend has points against exactly 120, although try diff is off. The claim requires both try diff to be +15 and points against to be 120. Looking through each row, none of the teams satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. For each team:\n\n- Try diff must be +15: Only Narbonne has +15.\n- Points against must be 120: Only Bridgend has that.\n\nSo no single team has both these exact numbers at the same time. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by any row in the table.\n\nI think that's it. The claim is false because there's no team where both try diff is +15 and points against are 120.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"try diff\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, I should look for a team that has both exactly 23 tries against and exactly 213 points against.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n| team               |   tries for |   tries against | try diff   |   points for |   points against | points diff   |\n|:-------------------|------------:|----------------:|:-----------|-------------:|-----------------:|:--------------|\n| castres olympique  |          29 |               6 | + 23       |          207 |               71 | + 136         |\n| narbonne           |          21 |               6 | + 15       |          161 |               90 | + 71          |\n| dinamo - bucure\u015fti |          12 |              32 | 20         |          109 |              213 | 104           |\n| bridgend           |          10 |              14 | 4          |           94 |              120 | 26            |\n| bristol shoguns    |          11 |              12 | 1          |          128 |               99 | + 29          |\n| treorchy           |          10 |              23 | 13         |           72 |              178 | 106           |\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nStarting with castres olympique: tries against is 6, points against is 71. Doesn't match.\n\nNarbonne: tries against 6, points against 90. No match.\n\nDinamo - bucure\u015fti: tries against 32, points against 213. Wait, that's one part of the claim. So this row has points against as 213.\n\nTreorchy: tries against is 23, points against is 178. Hmm, so tries against is 23 but points against is not 213.\n\nLooking for a row where both tries against is 23 and points against is 213.\n\nBut in the table, treorchy has tries against as 23 but points against is 178. Dinamo - bucure\u015fti has points against 213, but their tries against are 32. So neither of these two rows have both 23 and 213 for the respective columns.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"tries against be 23 when point against be 213.\" Maybe it's saying that in a particular game or context where one team has 23 tries against and another has 213 points against? But looking at the table, each row represents a team's performance across all their matches. So for example, Dinamo - bucure\u015fti have 32 tries against and 213 points against. Treorchy have 23 tries against but only 178 points against.\n\nSo is there any team that has both 23 tries against and 213 points against? From the table, it doesn't look like it. The rows either don't match both or just one part.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because no single row in the table has both exactly 23 tries against and exactly 213 points against.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Perhaps the claim is trying to say that for a particular team, when their tries against is 23, their points against are 213. But looking at treorchy, they have 23 tries against but only 178 points against. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's saying that in a game where one team had 23 tries against, the other team scored 213 points against. But since each row is per team, I'm not sure if that's how it's structured. It might be better to think of each row as a team's performance across all matches.\n\nSo, putting it together, there's no team in the table where both tries against is exactly 23 and points against is exactly 213. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that for a particular team, when their tries against are 23, their points against total 213. However, upon reviewing the table, no such row exists where both conditions are met simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tries against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"when tries for be 21 then the tries against be 32.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. It has several columns: team, tries for, tries against, try diff, points for, points against, and points diff. Each row represents a different team with corresponding statistics.\n\nThe claim is in the format of \"when X then Y.\" Here, X is \"tries for be 21,\" meaning we're looking for a team where the number of tries for is 21. Y is \"the tries against be 32,\" so when that condition is met (tries for = 21), does the corresponding team have tries against equal to 32?\n\nSo, I'll start by scanning each row's \"tries for\" column to find which team has exactly 21 tries for. Looking at the table:\n\n- Castres Olympique: 29\n- Narbonne: 21 \u2192 This is our X.\n- Dinamo - bucure\u015fti: 12\n- Bridgend: 10\n- Bristol Shoguns: 11\n- Treorchy: 10\n\nOnly Narbonne has 21 tries for. Now, I need to check if this team also has tries against equal to 32.\n\nLooking at the \"tries against\" column:\n\n- Castres Olympique: 6\n- Narbonne: 6 \u2192 Hmm, that's not 32.\nWait, that doesn't match. So, according to the table, Narbonne has 21 tries for and 6 tries against, which doesn't satisfy Y.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The claim says when \"tries for be 21,\" so only Narbonne fits here. Now, does Narbonne have \"tries against\" equal to 32? No, it's 6. So the condition isn't met.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no team where tries for is 21 and tries against is 32. The relevant cells are the ones for Narbonne: specifically, \"tries for\" and \"tries against.\" So I should include those in the relevant_cells list.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. It says \"when tries for be 21 then the tries against be 32.\" So it's an implication where if a team has 21 tries for, they must have 32 against. Since no such team exists, the claim is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are Narbonne's row, columns \"tries for\" and \"tries against.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"when point diff be +71 then the try diff be -20.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Point diff and try diff refer to the differences between points for and against, and tries for and against, respectively. So, point diff is points_for minus points_against, and try diff is tries_for minus tries_against.\n\nThe claim seems to suggest that whenever there's a positive 71 point difference (points_diff = +71), there should be a corresponding negative 20 try difference (try_diff = -20). I need to check the table provided to see if any row matches this condition.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and calculate both the points_diff and try_diff. Let's see:\n\n1. **Castres Olympique**: points_for=207, points_against=71. So, points_diff = 207 - 71 = +136. Tries_for=29, tries_against=6. Try_diff = 29 - 6 = +23. So here, neither is +71 nor -20.\n\n2. **Narbonne**: points_for=161, points_against=90. Points_diff = 161 - 90 = +71. Tries_for=21, tries_against=6. Try_diff = 21 - 6 = +15. Oh, here we have a points_diff of +71 and try_diff is +15, not -20.\n\n3. **Dinamo Bucure\u015fti**: points_for=109, points_against=213. Points_diff = 109 - 213 = -104. Tries_for=12, tries_against=32. Try_diff = 12 - 32 = -20. So here, neither is +71.\n\n4. **Bridgend**: points_for=94, points_against=120. Points_diff = 94 - 120 = -26. Tries_for=10, tries_against=14. Try_diff = 10 - 14 = -4. Again, no match.\n\n5. **Bristol Shoguns**: points_for=128, points_against=99. Points_diff = 128 - 99 = +29. Tries_for=11, tries_against=12. Try_diff = 11 - 12 = -1. Doesn't fit.\n\n6. **Treorchy**: points_for=72, points_against=178. Points_diff = 72 - 178 = -106. Tries_for=10, tries_against=23. Try_diff = 10 - 23 = -13. No match here either.\n\nWait a second, in the Narbonne row, there is a points_diff of +71 and try_diff of +15. That's not what the claim says. The claim says when point diff is +71, try diff should be -20. So this row actually doesn't support the claim because the try diff isn't negative.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any row in the table where points_diff is +71 and try_diff is -20. The only row with a points_diff of +71 has a try_diff of +15 instead. So the claim seems to be false based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that whenever there's a points difference of +71, the tries difference should be -20.

The claim says, \"when point against be 213 then the try diff be -4.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and understand what each column represents. The columns are: team, tries for, tries against, try diff, points for, points against, and points diff. So, the relevant parts here are the 'tries against' and 'try diff' columns.\n\nThe claim mentions that when \"point against\" is 213, then \"try diff\" should be -4. I need to check if any team in the table has exactly 213 in the 'points against' column and whether their try difference corresponds to -4.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Castres Olympique: points against = 71\n2. Narbonne: points against = 90\n3. Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti: points against = 213\n4. Bridgend: points against = 120\n5. Bristol Shoguns: points against = 99\n6. Treorchy: points against = 178\n\nSo, the only team with points against as 213 is Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti. Now, let's check their try diff.\n\nDinamo - Bucure\u015fti has tries for = 12, tries against = 32, so try diff is 12 - 32 = -20. Wait, but the claim says try diff should be -4. That doesn't match.\n\nWait a second, maybe I miscalculated? Let me double-check. Tries for minus tries against: 12 - 32 equals -20. The try diff in the table is listed as 20. Oh, perhaps they wrote it with a plus and without, but actually, if it's positive or negative.\n\nWait, in the table, Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti has try diff as +20? Wait no, looking back:\n\nIn the markdown table, for Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti, \"tries against\" is 32, so tries for is 12. The try diff is listed as 20, but it's written with a plus sign: \"+20\". So that would mean their points for minus points against is also +20? Wait no, the 'try diff' is separate from 'points diff'. Let me make sure.\n\nIn the table:\n\n- For Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti:\n  - tries for =12\n  - tries against=32\n  - try diff=20 (but written as \"+20\", so maybe it's +20)\n  \nBut wait, the term \"try diff\" usually is calculated as tries for minus tries against. So 12-32= -20, but in the table, it says +20. That seems inconsistent. Maybe they have a different calculation, like points for minus points against? But no, that would be points diff.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the table presents it: if it's positive, then the team is ahead; negative, behind. So, if Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti has 12 tries for and 32 against, their try difference is 12-32= -20. But in the table, under 'try diff', it says +20. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait no, looking at the markdown:\n\n| dinamo - bucure\u015fti |          12 |              32 | 20         |\n\nSo for Dinamo, tries for =12, tries against=32, try diff is +20? So that would mean they have a +20 in their try difference. But mathematically, if you subtract tries against from tries for, it's -20. So perhaps the table is using points for minus points against as the try diff? Wait no, 'try diff' should be tries for minus tries against.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me re-express each row:\n\n- Castres Olympique:\n  Tries for:29\n  Tries against:6\n  Try diff:+23\n  Points for:207\n  Points against:71\n  Points diff:+136\n\n- Narbonne:\n  Tries for:21\n  Tries against:6\n  Try diff:+15\n  Points for:161\n  Points against:90\n  Points diff:+71\n\n- Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti:\n  Tries for:12\n  Tries against:32\n  Try diff:20\n  Points for:109\n  Points against:213\n  Points diff:104\n\nWait, so in the 'try diff' column, it's +23 for Castres, +15 for Narbonne, +20 for Dinamo, +4 for Bridgend, +1 for Bristol, and +13 for Treorchy.\n\nBut the calculation of try diff should be tries for minus tries against. So:\n\nFor Castres: 29 -6=+23 \u2705\n\nNarbonne:21-6=+15 \u2705\n\nDinamo:12-32=-20 \u274c but in table it's +20. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, so perhaps the table is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the term 'try diff'. Alternatively, could it be points for minus points against as try diff? Let me check:\n\nFor Dinamo, points for=109, points against=213. So 109-213=-104, but in the table, points diff is +104. That matches: if points diff is 109 -213= -104, but in the table it's written as +104, perhaps indicating that they have a positive point difference, meaning they scored more? Wait no, if points for is less than points against, their points diff should be negative.\n\nWait, maybe the way the table is presented, the sign indicates whether it's ahead or behind. So + means ahead, - means behind. So for Dinamo:\n\nTries diff: 12-32= -20, but in the table it says +20. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'try diff' is points for minus tries against? Let me check:\n\n109 (points for) -213 (points against)= -104, which doesn't match the try diff of +20. So that can't be.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the table because the try diff should logically be 12-32=-20, not +20. But perhaps it's a typo or a misinterpretation. However, regardless of that, the key point is whether when points against=213, the try diff is -4.\n\nLooking at Dinamo's data:\n\nPoints against=213, and their try diff is +20 (as per table). The claim says when points against=213, try diff should be -4. But in reality, it's +20. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when a team has 213 points against, their try difference should be -4. However, examining Dinamo - Bucure\u015fti, which has 213 points against, their try diff is actually +20, not -4.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points against\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"try diff\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
