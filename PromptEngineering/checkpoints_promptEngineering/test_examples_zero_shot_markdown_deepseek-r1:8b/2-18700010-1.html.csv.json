    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"Among the players in the df position, Dave Sutton has the most league goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing Dave Sutton's league goals to other players in the defensive forward (df) position. So, I need to look at all the players listed under the \"name\" column where their position is df and then check how many league goals each has.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"name\", \"position\", \"league apps\", \"league goals\", etc. But since the claim is about league goals specifically for df players, I should focus on the \"df\" position and the \"league goals\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Jim Bane\u011fan: df, 0 apps, 0 goals.\n2. Malcolm Brown: df, 46 apps, 2 goals.\n3. David Cowling: mf, so not relevant here because it's a different position.\n4. Peter Fletcher: fw, same reason.\n5. Keith Hanvey: df, 33 apps, 2 goals.\n6. Peter Hart: mf, irrelevant.\n7. Ian Holmes: mf, irrelevant.\n8. Steve Kindon: fw, irrelevant.\n9. Mick Laverick: mf, irrelevant.\n10. Bernard Purdie: df, 18 apps (4), 0 goals.\n11. Andy Rankin: gk, not df.\n12. Ian Robins: fw, nope.\n13. Fred Robinson: df, 30 apps, 1 goal.\n14. Tommy Smith: fw, irrelevant.\n15. Brian Stanton: mf, nope.\n16. Alan Starling: gk, nope.\n17. Dave Sutton: df, 46 apps, 6 goals.\n18. Chris Topping: df, 13 apps, 0 goals.\n\nSo, from the df players, their league goals are:\n\n- Jim Bane\u011fan: 0\n- Malcolm Brown: 2\n- Keith Hanvey: 2\n- Bernard Purdie: 0\n- Fred Robinson: 1\n- Dave Sutton: 6\n- Chris Topping: 0\n\nNow, the claim is that Dave Sutton has the most league goals among df players. Looking at these numbers, Dave has 6 league goals. Let's see if anyone else in df has more.\n\nMalcolm Brown has 2, Keith Hanvey also has 2, Fred Robinson has 1, and others have less. So Dave's 6 is higher than all of them. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: The relevant columns are \"position\" and \"league goals\". For each df player, we need their league goal count. So each row where position is df has a cell in \"league goals\".\n\nLooking at the table, rows 0,1,4,9,10,17 have position df.\n\nRow indices (assuming starting from 0):\n\n- Row 0: Jim Bane\u011fan\n- Row 1: Malcolm Brown\n- Row 4: Keith Hanvey\n- Row 9: Bernard Purdie\n- Row 10: Fred Robinson\n- Row 17: Dave Sutton\n- Row 18: Chris Topping\n\nWait, in the table provided, let me count the rows correctly.\n\nThe first row is index 0, and each subsequent row increases by 1. So the df players are:\n\nRow 0: Jim Bane\u011fan\n\nRow 1: Malcolm Brown\n\nRow 4: Keith Hanvey\n\nRow 9: Bernard Purdie\n\nRow 10: Fred Robinson\n\nRow 17: Dave Sutton\n\nRow 18: Chris Topping\n\nSo for each of these rows, the relevant column is \"league goals\". So the cells to include are:\n\n- Row 0: league goals (value 0)\n- Row 1: league goals (2)\n- Row 4: league goals (2)\n- Row 9: league goals (0)\n- Row 10: league goals (1)\n- Row 17: league goals (6)\n- Row 18: league goals (0)\n\nSo the relevant_cells array should include these rows and their respective \"league goals\" column.\n\nI think that's all. So now, I can structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the 2 player with the highest league apps be malcolm brown and peter hart.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. League apps refer to the number of league appearances each player has made. The claim says that the two players with the highest league apps are Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each player's \"league apps\" column. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Jim Bignagan: 0 league apps.\n- Malcolm Brown: 46 league apps.\n- David Cowling: 39 (1) league apps.\n- Peter Fletcher: 30 (8) league apps.\n- Keith Hanvey: 33 league apps.\n- Peter Hart: 46 league apps.\n- Ian Holmes: 6 (4) league apps.\n- Steve Kindon: 22 (1) league apps.\n- Mick Laverick: 45 league apps.\n- Bernard Purdie: 18 (4) league apps.\n- Andy Rankin: 24 league apps.\n- Ian Robins: 45 league apps.\n- Fred Robinson: 30 league apps.\n- Tommy Smith: 0 league apps.\n- Brian Stanton: 41 league apps.\n- Alan Starling: 22 league apps.\n- Dave Sutton: 46 league apps.\n- Chris Topping: 13 league apps.\n\nNow, I need to identify who has the highest number of league apps. Let's list them out:\n\n- Malcolm Brown: 46\n- Peter Hart: 46\n- Mick Laverick: 45\n- Ian Robins: 45\n- Dave Sutton: 46\n\nWait, so both Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart have 46 league apps each. That matches the claim that they are the two with the highest. \n\nBut then there's Mick Laverick and Ian Robins also at 45, and Dave Sutton at 46 as well. So actually, there are multiple players tied for the highest. But the claim specifically mentions only Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart.\n\nSo does the claim imply that they have the highest, or that no one else has higher? The wording is \"the 2 player with the highest league apps be malcolm brown and peter hart.\" That suggests that those two are the top two, but in reality, there might be others tied at 46 as well. \n\nBut wait, let me check each player's exact numbers:\n\n- Malcolm Brown: 46\n- Peter Hart: 46\n- Dave Sutton: 46\n\nSo all three have 46 league apps, which is higher than the next ones like Mick Laverick and Ian Robins at 45.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it only mentions two players when there are actually three who tied for the highest league apps. So the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The claim is about \"league apps,\" so I need the column name and their row indices.\n\nMalcolm Brown is at row 1 (since it's 0-indexed). League apps are in the third column, so column \"league apps\". Peter Hart is at row 13, same column. Dave Sutton is at row 18, but since he also has 46, do I need to include him? The claim only mentions Malcolm and Peter, but perhaps he's just pointing out that they are among the top two. But in reality, there are three. So the relevant cells would be for Malcolm (row1, league apps) and Peter (row13, league apps).\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart have the highest number of \"league apps.\" \n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Malcolm Brown** has 46 league apps.\n- **Peter Hart** also has 46 league apps.\n- Additionally, **Dave Sutton** also has 46 league apps.\n\nSince there are three players with 46 league apps (the highest), the claim that only Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart are the top two is false. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the players' names, positions, and league apps are listed because they directly relate to verifying the number of appearances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that Ian Robins has the most league goals among all the players listed in the table.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table to find the relevant information. The key column here is \"league goals,\" so I need to focus on that. Each row represents a player with their respective stats.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the number of league goals for each player:\n\n1. Jim Bannagan - 0\n2. Malcolm Brown - 2\n3. David Cowling - 10\n4. Peter Fletcher - 17\n5. Keith Hanvey - 2\n6. Peter Hart - 4\n7. Ian Holmes - 3\n8. Steve Kindon - 14\n9. Mick Laverick - 4\n10. Bernard Purdie - 0\n11. Andy Rankin - 0\n12.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 25 is higher than all. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\nLooking back at each player's \"league goals\" column:\n\n- Ian Robins: 25\n- Peter Fletcher: 17\n- Steve Kindon: 14\n- David Cowling: 10\n- Brian Stanton: 9\n\nYes, Ian Robins has the highest number of league goals with 25. So the claim is that he is the player with the highest number, which matches the table data.\n\nI should also check if there are any other players with higher numbers, but none seem to exceed 25.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the player with the highest number of total goal be ian robin.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The term \"total goals\" refers to the sum of all goals a player has scored across all competitions they've been involved in. So, for each player listed in the table, I need to find their total goals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player. The columns relevant here are \"name,\" \"total goals,\" and possibly others like \"league goals\" or \"fa cup goals,\" but since it's about total goals, that's the key column we're focusing on.\n\nI need to locate Ian Robin in the table. Scanning through the names: there's a row for \"ian holmes,\" \"ian robins.\" Oh, wait, no, \"ian holmes\" and \"ian robins\" are different people. So, the player in question is \"ian robins.\"\n\nNow, checking his total goals. In the table, for each player, their name is followed by various stats. For \"ian robins,\" under \"total goals,\" I see the number 27. That's a pretty high number compared to others.\n\nLooking at other players: \n- Malcolm Brown has 3 total goals.\n- David Cowling has 10.\n- Peter Fletcher has 18.\n- Ian Holmes has 4.\n- Steve Kindon has 14.\n- Mick Laverick has 4.\n- Bernard Purdie has 0.\n- Andy Rankin has 0.\n- Fred Robinson has 1.\n- Tommy Smith has 0.\n- Brian Stanton has 9.\n- Alan Starling has 0.\n- Dave Sutton has 7.\n- Chris Topping has 0.\n\nOut of all these, Ian Robins has the highest total goals with 27.

My task is to check each player's FA Cup goals and see if all others have zero except Peter.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the \"fa cup goals\" column. The players are listed from jim branagan down to chris topping. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Jim Bragan**: fa cup goals = 0\n2. **Malcolm Brown**: 0\n3. **David Cowling**: 0\n4. **Peter Fletcher**: 0\n5. **Keith Hanvey**: 0\n6. **Peter Hart**: 1 (since FA Cup apps are 1, and goals are 0?

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dave sutton have the list league goal in df position\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The name mentioned is \"dave sutton,\" and he's supposed to be in the \"df\" (defensive forward) position. The claim also mentions that he has the list league goal. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what \"list league goal\" exactly refers to. It might mean that Dave Sutton has a certain number of goals in the league.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the relevant cells for Dave Sutton. Let me scan through each row until I find his name. Here's the row:\n\n| dave sutton   | df         | 46            |              6 |             2 |              0 | 4                 |                  1 | 52           |             7 |\n\nSo, Dave Sutton is in the \"df\" position as stated. Now, the claim mentions something about \"league goals.\" In the table, under his name and position, we have several columns: league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, and total goals.\n\nI think \"league goals\" refers to the number of goals scored in the league competitions. Looking at the row for Dave Sutton, under \"league goals,\" it's written as 6. Wait, but sometimes there are numbers in parentheses. Let me check:\n\n- League apps: 46\n- League goals: 6 (without any parenthesis)\n- Fa cup apps: 2\n- Fa cup goals: 0\n- League cup apps: 4\n- League cup goals: 1\n\nSo, the league goals for Dave Sutton are 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the claim says \"dave sutton have the list league goal in df position.\" Wait, maybe it's a translation issue or wording confusion. It might mean that in his df position, he has some league-related goals. From the table, he does play in df and has 6 league goals, so that seems to support the claim.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused by \"list league goal.\" Does that refer to being included in a list of league goal-scorers, or just having a number of league goals? If it's about the count, then 6 is correct. But if it's about being listed as a goal-scorer, perhaps the wording is different.\n\nIn any case, based on the table, Dave Sutton has 6 league goals in his df position. So, the claim seems to be TRUE because he does have those statistics. Therefore, I should check which cells are relevant to confirm this.\n\nThe relevant cells would be:\n\n1. His row index: looking at the table, \"dave sutton\" is towards the middle, let me count to find his row index. Starting from 0, it's row number 14 because there are 26 players listed in total (let me check the initial markdown; yes, each row has a name and position, so there are 16 rows? Wait, no, the table starts with \"jim branagan\" as first row, then next until \"chris topping\" is last. Let's count:\n\n1. jim branagan\n2. malcolm brown\n3. david cowling\n4. peter fletcher\n5. keith hanvey\n6. peter hart\n7. ian holmes\n8. steve kindon\n9. mick laverick\n10. bernard purdie\n11. andy rankin\n12. ian robins\n13. fred robinson\n14. tommy smith\n15. brian stanton\n16. alan starling\n17. dave sutton\n18. chris topping\n\nWait, no, the table in markdown starts with jim branagan as row 1, and goes up to chris topping as row 26? Wait, actually, let me count the number of rows properly because the initial markdown shows each player's data on separate lines.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- The first player is jim branagan (row 0?), then malcolm brown (row 1), ..., up to dave sutton and chris topping. Let me list them out with their row indices as per programming, starting from 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are in order, so \"dave sutton\" is the 17th player if counting starts at 1. But for this purpose, I think each row has a unique index, and to get \"row_index,\" we need the position of Dave Sutton's row in the table.\n\nLooking at the markdown, it seems like each line is a separate row, so the first line is row 0: jim branagan, then next is row 1: malcolm brown, etc. So, dave sutton would be around row 16 or 17. But to get the exact number, let me count:\n\nRows from 0:\n\n0: jim branagan\n1: malcolm brown\n2: david cowling\n3: peter fletcher\n4: keith hanvey\n5: peter hart\n6: ian holmes\n7: steve kindon\n8: mick laverick\n9: bernard purdie\n10: andy rankin\n11: ian robins\n12: fred robinson\n13: tommy smith\n14: brian stanton\n15: alan starling\n16: dave sutton\n17: chris topping\n\nYes, so Dave Sutton is on row 16.\n\nThe relevant columns for his stats are:\n\n- League goals (column index 6)\n- League apps (column index 1)\n- Position (df, column index 2)\n\nSo the cells to check would be:\n\nrow_index: 16\ncolumns: \"league apps\" and \"league goals\"\n\nWait, but the claim is about having league goals in df position. So, maybe the relevant columns are:\n\n- Position (to confirm he's in df)\n- League goals\n\nTherefore, the cells to include are row 16 (dave sutton), column for position (df) and column for league goals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that he has a certain number of league goals. So, checking both the position and the number of league goals.\n\nSo, in the JSON response, I should include:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 16,\n  \"column_name\": \"Position\",\n  \"value\": \"df\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 16,\n  \"column_name\": \"League Goals\",\n  \"value\": 6\n}\n\nBut wait, in the table, the columns are: Name, Position, League Apps, League Goals, FA Cup Apps, FA Cup Goals, League Cup Apps, League Cup Goals, Total Apps, Total Goals.\n\nSo, each row has these columns. Therefore, for Dave Sutton's row:\n\nIndex: 16\nName: dave sutton\nPosition: df (column index 2)\nLeague Goals: 6 (column index 6)\n\nSo the relevant cells are position and league goals.\n\nThus, in the JSON, I should list both columns to verify that he is indeed in the df position and has 6 league goals.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"dave sutton have the list league goal in df position\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check specific data points from the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Dave Sutton's Row:**\n   - Scanning through each row of the table until finding the name \"dave sutton.\"\n   - Upon inspection, \"dave sutton\" is found in the 17th position when counting from 1. However, considering programming indices starting at 0, his row index is 16.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - **Position:** This column confirms his role (df for defensive forward).\n   - **League Goals:** This column lists the number of goals scored in league competitions.\n\n3. **Extract Data from Dave Sutton's Row:**\n   - **Position:** df\n   - **League Goals:** 6\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim suggests that Dave Sutton is in the df position and has a certain number of league goals.\n   - From the data, it is confirmed he is in the df position and has 6 league goals.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is TRUE as supported by Dave Sutton's statistics in the table.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 16,\n    \"column_name\": \"Position\",\n    \"value\": \"df\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 16,\n    \"column_name\": \"League Goals\",\n    \"value\": 6\n  }\n]\n```",

So, I should find Tommy Smith's league goals from this column.\n\nLooking at his row, in the 'league goals' cell, it says \"0.\" That means Tommy Smith scored 0 league goals during the season.\n\nNow, to evaluate the claim, I need to check if he has the highest number of league goals among all the players listed. The table includes many players, so I should compare his league goals with others.\n\nLooking at other players: for example, Ian Robins has 25 league goals, which is much higher than Tommy Smith's 0. Similarly, David Cowling and Ian Holmes have several goals as well, while others like Steve Kindon and Brian Stanton also have more than zero. \n\nEven looking at the 'fa cup goals' column might provide context, but since the claim specifically mentions \"league goals,\" I should only consider that column for comparison.\n\nSince Tommy Smith's league goals are 0, and other players have higher numbers, it's clear he does not have the highest number of league goals. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table structure. The columns are: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, and total goals. \n\nThe claim is specifically about \"league apps,\" so my focus should be on that column for both Chris Topping and Dave Sutton.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find their entries:\n\n- **Chris Topping**: His row doesn't show a position in the 'name' column. Wait, actually, I need to check each row's name. Let me scan down. Oh, there is a \"chris topping\" entry. He's listed as having 13 league apps.\n\n- **Dave Sutton**: Scanning further, his row shows he has 46 league apps. That's a higher number than Chris Topping's 13.\n\nNow, the claim says both have the highest. So I need to check if both of them are at the top in their league apps column. But wait, if Dave has 46 and Chris only has 13, then they don't both have the highest together because someone else might have more.\n\nWait, let me check all players' league apps:\n\nLooking through each row's \"league apps\" column:\n\n- jim branagan: 0\n- malcolm brown:46\n- david cowling:39\n- peter fletcher:30\n- keith hanvey:33\n- peter hart:46\n- ian holmes:6\n- steve kindon:22\n- mick laverick:45\n- bernard purdie:18\n- andy rankin:24\n- ian robins:45\n- fred robinson:30\n- tommy smith:0\n- brian stanton:41\n- alan starling:22\n- dave sutton:46\n- chris topping:13\n\nSo, the highest number of league apps is 46, which is shared by Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart, as well as Dave Sutton. So Dave has 46, same as others.\n\nThe claim says Chris Topping and Dave Sutton have the highest. But from the data, Chris only has 13, which isn't close to the top. The highest are at 46, achieved by multiple players, not both Chris and Dave together because Chris is far behind.\n\nSo, the claim is false because while Dave Sutton does have a high number of league apps (46), Chris Topping's 13 is much lower than that and doesn't make them both having the highest.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}, {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 2 player with the highest number of total goals ian robin and chris topping.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the column that has the total goals. Looking through the table headers, I see there's a column named \"total goals\". So each row represents a player, and their respective total goals in that column.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find out who has the highest number of total goals. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Jim Bragan has 0 total goals.\n- Malcolm Brown has 3 total goals.\n- David Cowling has 10 total goals.\n- Peter Fletcher has 18 total goals.\n- Keith Hanvey has 2 total goals.\n- Peter Hart has 5 total goals.\n- Ian Holmes has 4 total goals.\n- Steve Kindon has 14 total goals.\n- Mick Laverick has 4 total goals.\n- Bernard Purdie has 0 total goals.\n- Andy Rankin has 0 total goals.\n- Ian Robins has 27 total goals. \n- Fred Robinson has 1 total goal.\n- Tommy Smith has 0 total goals.\n- Brian Stanton has 9 total goals.\n- Alan Starling has 0 total goals.\n- Dave Sutton has 7 total goals.\n- Chris Topping has 0 total goals.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"Ian Robin\" and \"Chris topping.\" Looking at the table, I see that the player's name is \"Ian Robins,\" not \"Ian Robin.\" So maybe there's a typo in the claim. But regardless of the name, I need to check their total goals.\n\nLooking for Chris Topping: In row 18 (which is Chris Topping), the total goals are 0.\n\nSo Ian Robins has 27 total goals, which is the highest so far. The next highest would be Brian Stanton with 9 and Dave Sutton with 7. So only one player has the highest total goals. Therefore, there isn't another player who shares this highest number of total goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ian Robin and Chris Topping have the highest number of total goals. From the table, Ian Robins (not \"Robin\") has the highest total goals with 27, while Chris Topping's total goals are 0. Therefore, only one player has the highest total goals.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Identify the column for total goals.\n2. Check each player's total goals.\n3. Find that Ian Robins has the highest (27) and Chris Topping does not (0).\n4. Conclude only one player has the highest, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"2 other player apart from peter hart have fa cup goal.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The term \"fa cup goals\" in the context of the table refers to the number of goals each player has scored in the FA Cup competitions. So, I need to look for players who have at least one FA Cup goal listed in their records.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with several columns, including \"fa cup goals.\" My focus should be on the \"fa cup goals\" column and count how many players, excluding Peter Hart, have scored at least one FA Cup goal.\n\nLet me go through each player one by one:\n\n1. **Jim Breenan**: fa cup goals are 0.\n2. **Malcolm Brown**: fa cup goals are 0.\n3. **David Cowling**: fa cup goals are 0.\n4. **Peter Fletcher**: fa cup goals are 0.\n5. **Keith Hanvey**: fa cup goals are 0.\n6. **Peter Hart**: Let's skip him as per the claim.\n7. **Ian Holmes**: fa cup goals are 0.\n8. **Steve Kindon**: fa cup goals are 0.\n9. **Mick Laverick**: fa cup goals are 2. Wait, that's two goals, so he has FA Cup goals.\n10. **Bernard Purdie**: fa cup goals are 0.\n11. **Andy Rankin**: fa cup goals are 0.\n12. **Ian Robins**: fa cup goals are 0.\n13. **Fred Robinson**: fa cup goals are 0.\n14. **Tommy Smith**: fa cup goals are 0.\n15. **Brian Stanton**: fa cup goals are 0.\n16. **Alan Starling**: fa cup goals are 2. Another player with FA Cup goals.\n17. **Dave Sutton**: fa cup goals are 2. Third player with FA Cup goals.\n18. **Chris Topping**: fa cup goals are 0.\n\nSo, excluding Peter Hart, Mick Laverick and Alan Starling have FA Cup goals. That's three players, not two as the claim suggests. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims only two other players besides Peter Hart have FA Cup goals when in reality there are more.\n\nWait, let me double-check the table to ensure I didn't miss any. Looking again at each player:\n\n- Mick Laverick: 2\n- Alan Starling: 2\n\nThat's two, but wait, is that correct? Let me count again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread some players. Let me go through them one more time:\n\n- Peter Hart has 1 FA Cup goal (fa cup goals = 1).\n- Mick Laverick: fa cup apps = 2, so if he's scored any goals, it's likely at least 0 or more? Wait, the table might have 'fa cup goals' as 2 for him. So, yes, that counts.\n- Alan Starling: fa cup goals are 0? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the table, I think I made a mistake. Let me look at each player's \"fa cup goals\" column again.\n\nLooking row by row:\n\n- Jim Branagan: 0\n- Malcolm Brown: 0\n- David Cowling: 0\n- Peter Fletcher: 0\n- Keith Hanvey: 0\n- Peter Hart: 1 (since fa cup goals are 1)\n- Ian Holmes: 0\n- Steve Kindon: 0\n- Mick Laverick: 2\n- Bernard Purdie: 0\n- Andy Rankin: 0\n- Ian Robins: 0\n- Fred Robinson: 0\n- Tommy Smith: 0\n- Brian Stanton: 0\n- Alan Starling: 2\n- Dave Sutton: 2\n- Chris Topping: 0\n\nWait, now I see that Dave Sutton and Alan Starling both have 2 FA Cup goals. So excluding Peter Hart, there are at least two other players (Mick Laverick, Alan Starling, and Dave Sutton). That's three players with FA Cup goals.\n\nSo the claim says \"2 other player apart from peter hart have fa cup goal.\" But in reality, there are more than two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it doesn't correctly state the number of players who have FA Cup goals.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to count how many players (excluding Peter Hart) have scored at least one FA Cup goal.\n\n1. **Identify all players with \"fa cup goals\" > 0.**\n2. **Exclude Peter Hart.**\n3. **Count the remaining players.**\n\nFrom the table:\n- Mick Laverick: 2 goals\n- Alan Starling: 2 goals\n- Dave Sutton: 2 goals\n\nThus, there are three players, not two, who have FA Cup goals.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect because there are more than two other players with FA Cup goals. Therefore, the statement is **false**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",
