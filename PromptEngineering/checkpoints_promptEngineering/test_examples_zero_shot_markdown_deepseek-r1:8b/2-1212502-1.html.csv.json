    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"shrek be nominate for a tony award in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It mentions \"shrek\" being nominated for a Tony Award in 2009. So, I need to find any entries in the table where \"shrek\" is listed as the nominated work and the award is a Tony Award occurring in 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an instance of an award. The columns relevant here are 'year', 'award', 'nominated work', and 'result'. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if it matches the criteria:\n\n1. **Row 0 (2002):** Award is Tony, nominated work is \"thoroughly modern millie\". Not shrek.\n2. **Row 1 (2002):** Drama Desk, same work. No.\n3. **Row 2 (2002):** Drama League, same as above.\n4. **Row 3 (2002):** Outer Critics Circle, same category and work.\n5. **Row 4 (2002):** Astaire Award, same details. Not shrek.\n\nMoving to 2009:\n\n6. **Row 8 (2009):** Tony Award, best performance by a leading actress in a musical. Nominated work is \"shrek\". So this matches the claim.\n7. **Rows 9-10 (2009):** These are Drama Desk and League awards for shrek, but result is 'nominated', not 'won'.\n8. **Row 11 (2009):** Outer Critics Circle Award for shrek, but result is 'won'. This doesn't affect the Tony nomination claim.\n\nSo, in 2009, there's at least one row where \"shrek\" was nominated for a Tony Award. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2012 have a nominated result\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions \"2012 have a nominated result.\" So, it's about the year 2012 and whether there was a nomination in any category. My task is to check the table for the year 2012 and see if under that year, there's at least one 'nomination' listed as the result.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award or nomination with details like the year, award name, category, nominated work, and result. The rows are in markdown format, so I need to parse them correctly.\n\nI'll start by scanning the \"year\" column for 2012. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 2002\n- ...\n- Row 10: 2008\n- Row 11: 2009\n- Row 12: 2011\n- Row 13: 2012\n\nSo, the year 2012 is in row index 13. Now, I need to check what the result was for that specific row.\n\nLooking at row 13:\n\n| 2012 | teen choice award                | breakout star female                               | bunheads                 | nominated |\n\nSo, the result here is 'nominated'. Therefore, there's a nomination in 2012.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"have a nominated result.\" That means that for year 2012, at least one result is 'nomination.' Since row 13 shows a 'nominated' result under 2012, this supports the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows for 2012. From the table provided, I don't see another entry for 2012. The next entry is in 2013, which is beyond our focus year.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is row index 13, column \"result,\" which is 'nominated.'\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I'm not missing any other 2012 entries. Scanning through the table again, it goes up to 2013 and each subsequent row increments the year after 2012. So yes, only one entry for 2012.\n\nTherefore, since in 2012 there was a nomination, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on checking if year 2012 had any 'nomination' results. The table shows that in 2012, the 'teen choice award' for 'breakout star female' resulted in a nomination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"'shrek's nominated work won a drama award in 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. There are two main points: \n1. The nominated work was \"Shrek.\"\n2. It won a Drama Award in 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there's an entry where the category is Drama and the result is 'won' for \"Shrek\" in 2009.\n\nI'll go through each row from 2009. There are three rows:\n\n- Row 2008: nominated work is \"young frankenstein,\" so not relevant.\n- Rows 2009: all four columns mention \"shrek.\" Let's check each one.\n\nFor the first row in 2009 (row index 8), the award is Tony, and result is 'won.' But wait, the claim refers to a Drama Award, so this might be a different category. Next rows also for drama awards: same thing, result is 'nominated' except for outer critics circle, which says 'won.'\n\nWait, in row index 8 (2009), the column \"result\" is 'won,' but it's under the \"outer critics circle award.\" The claim mentions a Drama Award, so maybe that's not the right category.\n\nLooking again: the drama desk award and drama league award for 2009 are both 'nominated.' So none of them have 'won' in the result column. Only the outer critics circle awarded 'shrek' with a win. But that's under \"outer critics circle award,\" which is different from a Drama Desk or League Award.\n\nSo, did 'shrek' win any Drama Award (like Drama Desk) in 2009? From the table, it seems only the outer critics circle awarded them. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because the main drama awards didn't result in a win.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider if \"drama award\" refers to any of these categories or specifically the major ones like Tony or Drama Desk. If the claim is about winning a Drama Award in 2009, and only the outer critics circle says 'won,' but not the other drama awards, then technically, they didn't win all drama awards, just one.\n\nBut does \"drama award\" in the claim refer to any of these categories? The table has several: Tony, Drama Desk, Drama League, Outer Critics Circle, Astaire. So if the claim is about a specific type of award, maybe it's only referring to the major ones like Tony or Drama Desk.\n\nIn that case, since in 2009, 'shrek' was only awarded in the outer critics circle and others were nominated, not winning. Therefore, they didn't win a drama desk or league award in 2009, but only outer critics.\n\nSo the claim is partially true if considering all awards, but maybe incorrect if specifically referring to major drama awards like Tony or Drama Desk.\n\nBut looking at the table, 'shrek' was nominated for several categories in 2009. Only the outer critics circle awarded them as won. So depending on the exact award type, the claim could be misleading.\n\nTherefore, since the main drama desk and league didn't result in a win, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"shrek's nominated work won a drama award in 2009.\" After examining the table, we find that while 'shrek' was indeed nominated for several categories in 2009, only the outer critics circle awarded them, resulting in a win. However, the other main drama awards (Drama Desk and League) did not result in a win. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as it doesn't specify which award was won.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in 2012 , bunheads have win for breakout female star.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see if there's any information related to 2012 and bunheads winning a breakout female star award.\n\nLooking through each row, I can scan down the year column until I find 2012. The rows go from 2002 up to 2013, so 2012 is one of the years listed.\n\nIn the 2012 row, the award given is \"teen choice award,\" and the category is \"breakout star female.\" The nominated work is \"bunheads,\" but the result is \"nominated.\" So, bunheads were only nominated in 2012 for the teen choice award in the breakout star female category. They didn't actually win it.\n\nNow, checking other years: 2013 also mentions \"bunheads\" but it's for the critics' choice television award as best actress in a comedy series, and that was just nominated. So bunheads didn't win any awards after being nominated in 2012.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim says they won in 2012, but according to the table, they were only nominated, not winning. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in 2012, \"bunheads\" were nominated for a Teen Choice Award as Breakout Star Female, but they did not win.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
