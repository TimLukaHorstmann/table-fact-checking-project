    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the number in season for 4300062 be 19.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about a \"number in season\" associated with the production code 4300062 being 19. So, looking at the table, each row has several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, production code, and us viewers.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to the \"number in season.\" From the table headers, I can see that there's a column called \"no in season,\" which probably stands for \"number in season.\" That makes sense because each episode is part of a season, and each season has a number. For example, the first row has no in series 45 and no in season 1.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to find the row where the production code is 4300062 and check what the \"no in season\" value is for that row.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nI'll go through each row until I find the one with production code 4300062. Scanning down... \n\nRow 62 has production code 4300062. So, row_index is 62, and the column_name is \"no in season.\" The value there is 18.\n\nWait, but the claim says it should be 19. That means the actual number is 18, not 19. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo, I need to provide the relevant cells that confirm this. Since the production code is 4300062 and the column is \"no in season,\" these are the two relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"number in season\" for production code 4300062 should be 19. Upon examining the table, production code 4300062 corresponds to row 62 with a \"no in season\" value of 18, not 19.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
