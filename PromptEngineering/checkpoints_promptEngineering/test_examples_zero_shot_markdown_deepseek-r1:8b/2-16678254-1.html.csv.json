    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"week 8 on november 13 , 1949 have a w result with a score of 65 - 20.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and locate week 8. Let me go through each row. Week 1 is September 26, 1949. Then it goes up to week 12 in December. So week 8 would be November 13, 1949.\n\nLooking at the \"result\" column for that week. The result is listed as \"w 65 - 20\". That matches exactly what the claim is stating. So the score and the result both align with what's in the table.\n\nI should also check if any other columns might affect this, but since the claim specifically mentions week, date, opponent, result, and score, those are the only relevant columns. The opponent for week 8 is the New York Bulldogs, but the claim doesn't mention them, so it's not necessary to include that in the relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"there be a result of w 65 - 20 after week 9 on november 13 , 1949.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are the result (\"w 65 - 20\") and the specific week and date it's associated with.\n\nLooking at the table columns: week, date, opponent, result, record. So I need to look for a row where the week is 9 and the date is November 13, 1949. Also, the result should be \"w 65 - 20.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nWeek 1: Sep 26, 1949 \u2013 washington redskins, result w38-7\n\nWeek 2: Oct 2, 1949 \u2013 chicago bears, l17-7\n\nWeek 3: Oct 8, 1949 \u2013 philadelphia eagles, l28-3\n\nWeek 4: Oct 16, 1949 \u2013 green bay packers, w39-17\n\nWeek 5: Oct 23, 1949 \u2013 detroit lions, l24-7\n\nWeek 6: Oct 30, 1949 \u2013 new york giants, l41-38\n\nWeek 7: Nov 6, 1949 \u2013 detroit lions, w42-19\n\nWeek 8: Nov 13, 1949 \u2013 new york bulldogs, w65-20\n\nWeek 9: Nov 20, 1949 \u2013 los angeles rams, t28-28\n\nWait, so in week 8, the date is November 13, 1949, which matches part of the claim. The result for that week is \"w65-20,\" which exactly matches the claim's \"w65 - 20.\" However, the claim mentions \"after week 9 on november 13 , 1949.\" But looking at the table, week 8 is November 13, and week 9 is November 20. So the result of w65-20 happened in week 8, not week 9.\n\nSo the claim says it's after week 9, but according to the table, the game was on week 8. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the result occurred earlier than stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there was a result of \"w65 - 20\" after week 9 on November 13, 1949. Checking the table, the game against the New York Bulldogs with that result happened in week 8, not week 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
