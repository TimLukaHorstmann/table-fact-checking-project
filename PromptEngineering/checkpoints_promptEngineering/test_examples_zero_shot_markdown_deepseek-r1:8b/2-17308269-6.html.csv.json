    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ann strother (g) be from conneticut\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully examining the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it says that Ann Strother (g), who plays as a guard (g), is from Connecticut. The table provided lists various WNBA players with their details, including their former WNBA team, nationality, and other information.\n\nI need to find Ann Strother in the table. Let me go through each row one by one until I find her name.\n\nLooking at the \"player\" column:\n- Row 1: carla thomas (f)\n- Row 2: erika desouza (f)\n- Row 3: katie feenstra (c)\n- Row 4: roneeka hodges (f)\n- Row 5: ann strother (g) \u2192 Found her here. She's in row 5.\n\nNow, let me check the nationality for Ann Strother. The \"nationality\" column for row 5 says \"united states.\" So she is an American player.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that she is from Connecticut. I need to verify if this aligns with the table. Looking at the \"college / country / team\" column for row 5: it's listed as \"connecticut.\"\n\nWait, but the \"college / country / team\" might refer to where she played before or her origin. Since she's a WNBA player from the US, and her college is Connecticut, that aligns with being from Connecticut.\n\nBut let me double-check the \"former wnba team\" for Ann Strother. In row 5, it says \"indiana fever.\" So she was part of the Indiana Fever before joining the Atlanta Dream.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim states she is from Connecticut. The table shows her college as Connecticut and her nationality as US. Therefore, being from Connecticut makes sense in the context of a WNBA player's origin, especially if they are from the US without specifying a different location.\n\nI don't see any information that contradicts the claim. So based on the table provided, Ann Strother is from Connecticut.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Ann Strother (g) player be from Connecticut and be never play on Indiana Fever.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Ann Strother is a player.\n2. She is from Connecticut.\n3. She has never played for the Indiana Fever.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the player is Ann Strother and then check the relevant columns: nationality and former WNBA team.\n\nStarting with the table:\n\n|   pick | player                 | nationality   | new wnba team   | former wnba team         | college / country / team   |\n|-------:|:-----------------------|:--------------|:----------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------------|\n|      1 | carla thomas (f)       | united states | atlanta dream   | chicago sky              | vanderbilt                 |\n|      2 | erika desouza (f)      | brazil        | atlanta dream   | connecticut sun          | brazil                     |\n|      3 | katie feenstra (c)     | united states | atlanta dream   | detroit shock            | liberty                    |\n|      4 | roneeka hodges (f)     | united states | atlanta dream   | houston comets           | florida state              |\n|      5 | ann strother (g)       | united states | atlanta dream   | indiana fever            | connecticut                |\n|      6 | latoya thomas (g)      | united states | atlanta dream   | los angeles sparks       | mississippi state          |\n|      7 | kristen mann (f)       | united states | atlanta dream   | minnesota lynx           | uc santa barbara           |\n|      8 | ann wauters (c)        | belgium       | atlanta dream   | new york liberty         | belgium                    |\n|      9 | jennifer lacy (f)      | united states | atlanta dream   | phoenix mercury          | pepperdine                 |\n|     10 | kristin haynie (g)     | united states | atlanta dream   | sacramento monarchs      | michigan state             |\n|     11 | chantelle anderson (c) | united states | atlanta dream   | san antonio silver stars | vanderbilt                 |\n|     12 | betty lennox (g)       | united states | atlanta dream   | seattle storm            | louisiana tech             |\n|     13 | yelena leuchanka (f)   | belarus       | atlanta dream   | washington mystics       | belarus                    |\n\nLooking for Ann Strother: She is row 5. Now, checking her nationality. Column \"nationality\" says \"united states.\" So she's from the US, not Connecticut, because Connecticut is a state in the USA but nationality refers to country. Wait, no, actually, the column might be referring to where she plays or something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim says she is \"from Connecticut,\" which would likely mean her nationality, but sometimes people use \"from\" to refer to birthplace or state. However, in the context of a WNBA table, nationality is usually country-based. So Ann Strother's nationality is United States, not Connecticut.\n\nNow, checking whether she has played for Indiana Fever. The \"former wnba team\" column says \"indiana fever.\" So yes, she has played for them.\n\nWait, but the claim says she \"never play on indiana fever.\" That would be incorrect because according to the table, her former team is Indiana Fever. Therefore, she did play there. So the claim is false because she did play for Indiana Fever, and she isn't from Connecticut as per nationality; if it's about state, maybe, but I think in this context, nationality refers to country.\n</think>\n\nThe player Ann Strother is from the United States (nationality), not Connecticut, and she has played for the Indiana Fever team. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
