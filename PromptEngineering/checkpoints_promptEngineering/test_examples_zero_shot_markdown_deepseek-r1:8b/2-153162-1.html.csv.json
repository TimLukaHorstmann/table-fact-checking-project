    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me read through both carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporated in malaysia , except for taj madras air catering limit , which be incorporate in india.\" Hmm, I think there's a typo here, maybe they meant 'incorporated' instead of 'be incorporate'. But regardless, I need to check each relevant cell.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various companies under \"company\", their types like subsidiary or associate, and where they're incorporated. The claim is about subsidiaries and associates being incorporated in Malaysia, except for one that's in India.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row and see which ones are subsidiaries or associates. Then check their incorporation details.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. So this should be okay.\n2. ge engine services malaysia - joint venture, Malaysia. Not a subsidiary or associate, so not relevant for this claim.\n3. maswings sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n4. firefly sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n5. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n6. mas golden holidays sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n7. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n8. mas academy sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n9. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n10. taj madras air catering limited - associate, India. This seems to be the exception in the claim.\n11. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia. Good.\n12. lsg sky chefs - associate, Malaysia. So this is an associate incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says all subsidiaries and associates except Taj Madras are in Malaysia. But LSG Sky Chefs is an associate and incorporated in Malaysia, which fits the claim. However, I also notice that Taj Madras is an associate but incorporated in India. So it seems like only Taj Madras is the exception.\n\nLet me check if there are any other associates besides Taj Madras and LSG Sky Chefs. Looking at the table:\n\n- Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: associate, India\n- LSG Sky Chefs: associate, Malaysia\n\nSo yes, only Taj Madras is in India. All others listed as subsidiaries or associates (like maswings, firefly, etc.) are in Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct except for one company. So the answer should be TRUE because all except Taj Madras are in Malaysia. Wait, but the user's example included relevant cells, so I need to list which ones were checked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines are incorporated in Malaysia, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is incorporated in India.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where the company type is \"subsidary\" or \"associate.\"\n2. **Check Incorporation Details:** For each relevant row, verify if the incorporation country matches the claim.\n3. **Analyze Exceptions:** Only Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is associated with India; others are in Malaysia.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this decision. The claim is: \"Malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiaries.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various companies along with their types, principal activities, incorporation details, and equity shareholding information.\n\nI notice that the term \"Malaysia airline\" isn't explicitly present as a company name in the table, but there's an entity called \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd.\" However, this might be a subsidiary rather than the main Malaysia Airlines group. Wait, actually, looking back, I think the parent company of Malaysia Airlines is known as Malaysia Airlines Berhad, which isn't listed here, so perhaps in this context, \"Malaysia airline\" refers to companies within the group.\n\nThe claim says that they have 100% equity in 7 out of 9 subsidiaries. So I need to look for rows where the 'group's equity shareholding' is 100%. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 100%\n2. ge engine services malaysia: joint venture, equity 30%\n3. maswings sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 100%\n4. firefly sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 100%\n5. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 100%\n6. mas golden holidays sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 100%\n7. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 100%\n8. mas academy sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 100%\n9. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 80%\n10. taj madras air catering limited: associate, equity 20%\n11. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd: subsidiary, equity 60%\n12. lsg sky chefs: associate, equity 30%\n\nNow, let's count the number of subsidiaries where equity is 100%:\n\nRows 1,3-8, and 11 are subsidiaries with 100% equity. That's a total of 7 companies (rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7) if we index from 0. Wait, rows 0 is malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd. Then row1 is ge engine, which is joint venture, so no. So starting from row0: yes, then row2, etc., up to row8 (mas academy), that's 8 companies? Let me recount:\n\nRows with 100% equity and type 'subsidary':\n\n- Row 0: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd\n- Row2: maswings\n- Row3: firefly\n- Row4: mas aerotech\n- Row5: mas golden holidays\n- Row6: malaysian aerospace\n- Row7: mas academy\n- So that's 8 rows, not 7.\n\nWait, the table in markdown has 12 rows. Let me make sure:\n\nLooking at the markdown table again, each company is listed from index 0 to 11.\n\nRows with type 'subsidary' and equity 100% are:\n\n0: subsidiary, 100%\n1: joint venture, 30%\n2: subsidiary, 100%\n3: subsidiary, 100%\n4: subsidiary, 100%\n5: subsidiary, 100%\n6: subsidiary, 100%\n7: subsidiary, 100%\n8: abacus... 80%\n9: associate, 20%\n10: subsidiary, 60%\n11: associate, 30%\n\nSo the 'subsidary' companies with 100% equity are rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7. That's 7 rows.\n\nWait, row numbers 0 is index 0, then 2,3,4,5,6,7: that's 7 in total (including row0). So yes, there are 7 subsidiaries where equity is 100%. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"Malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiaries.\" The table shows 12 companies, but not all are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines. For example, some are joint ventures or associates.\n\nHowever, in this context, the term \"subsidiary\" refers to the type listed in the table. So the claim is about the number of subsidiaries (type 'subsidary') where equity is 100%. There are 7 such companies as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly 7 subsidiaries with 100% equity out of a total of 9 different types (since some are joint ventures or associates). Wait, but wait: in the table, how many 'subsidary' entries are there?\n\nLooking back, the 'type' column has:\n\n- subsidiary\n- joint venture\n- subsidiary\n- subsidiary\n- subsidiary\n- subsidiary\n- subsidiary\n- subsidiary\n- subsidiary (abacus)\n- associate\n- subsidiary (mas catering)\n- associate\n\nWait, actually, from the table:\n\ncompany type:\n\nRow0: subsidiary\nRow1: joint venture\nRow2: subsidiary\nRow3: subsidiary\nRow4: subsidiary\nRow5: subsidiary\nRow6: subsidiary\nRow7: subsidiary\nRow8: abacus is a subsidiary (type is 'subsidiary')\nRow9: associate\nRow10: subsidiary\nRow11: associate\n\nSo the total number of subsidiaries (type 'subsidary') is 9.\n\nLooking at their equity:\n\nRows 0,2-8,10: equity 100%, 30%, ..., wait no. Wait row8 is abacus and equity is 80%.\n\nWait, let me recount each row's type and equity:\n\nRow0: subsidiary, 100%\nRow1: joint venture, 30%\nRow2: subsidiary, 100%\nRow3: subsidiary, 100%\nRow4: subsidiary, 100%\nRow5: subsidiary, 100%\nRow6: subsidiary, 100%\nRow7: subsidiary, 100%\nRow8: abacus... type is 'subsidiary', equity 80%\nRow9: associate, equity 20%\nRow10: subsidiary, equity 60%\nRow11: associate, equity 30%\n\nSo the subsidiaries with 100% are rows0,2-7, and row10. That's 7 companies.\n\nThe total number of 'subsidary' entries is 9 (rows0,2-8,10). Wait, no:\n\nRows where type is 'subsidiary':\n\nRow0: yes\nRow1: joint venture, no\nRow2: yes\nRow3: yes\nRow4: yes\nRow5: yes\nRow6: yes\nRow7: yes\nRow8: abacus... the table says \"abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd\" is a 'subsidiary', so yes, type is 'subsidary'\nRow9: associate, no\nRow10: subsidiary, yes\nRow11: associate, no\n\nSo in total, there are 8 'subsidary' companies. Wait:\n\nRows0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10: that's 9 rows.\n\nBut wait row8 is abacus, type 'subsidiary', so yes.\n\nSo the claim says \"7 of their 9 different subsidiaries\". So in this case, out of 9 total 'subsidary' companies, 7 have 100% equity. That matches.\n\nTherefore, the statement is TRUE because there are exactly 7 subsidiaries (out of 9) where Malaysia Airlines has 100% ownership.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines has 100% equity in 7 out of its 9 different subsidiaries. By analyzing the provided table, we identify the following:\n\n- **Total Subsidiaries**: There are 9 companies listed with the type \"subsidiary.\"\n- **Subsidiaries with 100% Equity**: Among these, 7 have a 100% equity stake.\n\nThus, the claim is accurate as supported by the data provided.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is TRUE.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"Malaysia airline work with 2 different companies for catering: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about Malaysia Airlines working with two catering companies. So I need to find out if these two companies are indeed caterers for Malaysia Airlines as per the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a company with details like type, principal activities, incorporation country, and equity shareholding. The relevant columns here are \"company\" and \"principal activities,\" since we're interested in what each company does.\n\nI'll start by locating Taj Madras Air Catering Limited in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find it's row 10 with \"associate\" as its type and principal activity as \"catering.\" So that's one catering company mentioned in the claim.\n\nNext, looking for MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd, which is row 9. Its type is \"subsidary,\" and its principal activity is also \"catering.\" That fits too.\n\nNow, checking if these are both associated with Malaysia Airlines as their caterers. The table's rows show that Taj Madras has an equity shareholding of 20%, and MAS Cater (Sarawak) has 60%. Both are subsidiaries or associates, which likely means they work under Malaysia Airlines or related companies.\n\nWait, but does the table explicitly state that these companies are catering for Malaysia Airlines? The \"principal activities\" column says each company's main activity. For Taj Madras, it's catering, and for MAS Cater, it's also catering. Since both are associated with Malaysia Airlines (as seen in their incorporation details: Taj is from India but might still be linked via another group), they could be providing catering services.\n\nHowever, I should check if the claim says \"Malaysia airline\" specifically, which could refer to Malaysian Airline System or the national carrier. In any case, both companies are caterers for Malaysia Airlines groups.\n\nSo, the claim is about two different catering companies working with Malaysia Airlines: Taj Madras and MAS Cater. Both are listed in the table as providing catering services, so it seems TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Malaysia Airlines is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that Malaysia Airlines have a 30% equity shareholding in both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Services Malaysia, which are both not subsidiaries.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. The columns are company name, type, principal activities, incorporated in, and group's equity shareholding. I'll need to find rows where the parent company is Malaysia Airlines and see if they hold 30% equity. Also, check the type of each company to see if it's a subsidiary or not.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd** - It's a subsidiary with 100% equity shareholding. Not relevant since the claim is about 30%.\n\n2. **GE Engine Services Malaysia** - Joint venture, but the equity shareholding here is listed as 30%. Wait, in the table, this row shows that GE Engine Services Malaysia is a joint venture and has 30% equity from the group. But what's the parent? Is it Malaysia Airlines? Let me check the incorporated in column: It says Malaysia, so maybe the parent is MAS or another related entity.\n\nWait, actually, I'm trying to find if Malaysia Airlines (the main company) holds 30% in LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Services. So I need to see which rows have equity shareholding as 30%.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- **GE Engine Services Malaysia**: It's a joint venture with 30% equity shareholding from the group. The incorporated in is Malaysia, so possibly linked to MAS.\n\n- **LSG Sky Chef**: Wait, looking at the table, I don't see LSG Sky Chef listed. Hmm, maybe it's not directly in the table? Or perhaps the parent company of LSG Sky Chef is different. Wait, no, in the table provided, there's a row for LSG Sky Chef: \"lsg sky chefs\" is an associate with 30% equity shareholding and incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n- **LSG Sky Chef**: It's listed as an associate with 30% equity. So if the group is MAS or related, then yes, they have 30%.\n\n- **GE Engine Services Malaysia**: Also has 30% equity. But wait, is this company a subsidiary of MAS? The table says \"ge engine services malaysia\" is a joint venture, not a subsidiary.\n\nSo the claim states that both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Service are not subsidiaries but have 30% equity from Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- **GE Engine Services Malaysia**: It's a joint venture (type), so it's not a subsidiary. Equity is 30%.\n\n- **LSG Sky Chef**: Incorporated in Malaysia, type is associate, equity 30%. So it's also not a subsidiary.\n\nSo both companies have 30% equity and are associates/joint ventures, not subsidiaries.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true because both have 30% equity and are not subsidiaries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\" Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking closer, the claim says: \"of all the subsidiary of malaysia airline malaysia airline have the lowest equity shareholding in ma catering (sarawak) sdn bhd\". Hmm, perhaps there's a typo or misunderstanding here. It seems like they're referring to Malaysia Airlines as both the parent company and its subsidiaries, which doesn't quite make sense.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table, I see that \"Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd\" is listed as a subsidiary under the company column with type as subsidiary. Then there's another entry for \"MASwings Sdn Bhd\", \"Firefly Sdn Bhd\", etc., all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines. So perhaps the claim is about comparing the equity shareholdings among these subsidiaries, specifically in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\n\nBut wait, the table shows that \"mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd\" is a subsidiary with 60% equity owned by Malaysia Airlines. So perhaps the claim is saying that among all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, this particular one has the lowest equity shareholding, but actually, looking at the table, it's 60%, which might not be the lowest.\n\nWait no, let me look at all the 'group's equity shareholding' column:\n\n- MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: 60%\n- Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: 80%\n- Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: 20% (but this is under an associate, not a subsidiary)\n- LSG Sky Chefs: 30% (associate)\n\nSo among the subsidiaries, the equity shareholdings are as follows:\n\n- MAS Catering: 60%\n- Abacus Distribution Systems: 80%\n- MASwings: 100%\n- Firefly Sdn Bhd: 100%\n- MAS Aerotechnologies: 100%\n- MAS Academy: 100%\n- MAS Golden Holidays: 100%\n- Malaysian Aerospace Engineering: 100%\n- Malaysia Airlines Cargo: 100%\n\nWait, so all these subsidiaries except Abacus and LSG Sky Chefs (which are associates) have either 80%, 60%, or 30% (for LSG), but the highest is 100%, which seems to be for most of them. The lowest among the subsidiaries would be MAS Catering at 60%.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me list all the subsidiaries and their equity:\n\nSubsidiaries:\n- Malaysia Airlines Cargo: 100%\n- GE Engine Services: 30% (but this is a joint venture, not subsidiary)\nWait, no. Wait, in the table, \"ge engine services malaysia\" is a joint venture, not a subsidiary.

Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd - 100%\n7. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd - 100%\n8. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd - 80%\n9. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd - 60%\n\nThe claim says: \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\"\n\nWait, that seems to suggest that among all the subsidiaries, the parent company (Malaysia Airlines) has the lowest equity in MAS Catering. But looking at the table, the equity for MAS Catering is 60%, which is a subsidiary, and the parent's equity in it is 60%. So perhaps the claim is misphrased.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, the one with the lowest equity shareholding is MAS Catering, but that's not accurate because some subsidiaries have even lower. Wait, no, in the table, the subsidiaries' equity shareholdings are as follows:\n\n- 100% (most)\n- 80% (Abacus)\n- 60% (MAS Catering)\nSo among these, the lowest is MAS Catering at 60%, then Abacus at 80%, and others at 100%.\n\nBut wait, actually, LSG Sky Chefs is an associate with 30%, but it's not a subsidiary. So within subsidiaries, the lowest equity is 60% (MAS Catering).\n\nWait, no: the claim says \"of all the subsidiaries of malaysia airline malaysia airline have the lowest equity shareholding in ma catering\". So perhaps it's saying that among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, the parent company holds the lowest equity in MAS Catering. But the parent company's equity is 60%, which is higher than some others like LSG Sky Chefs (30%), but LSG is not a subsidiary.\n\nWait, no: in the table, for MAS Catering, it's a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines with group equity at 60%. So perhaps the claim is that among all subsidiaries, the parent company has the lowest equity in this particular subsidiary. But the parent's equity is 60%, which is higher than some other companies, but those are not subsidiaries.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe claim says: \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\"\n\nSo among all the companies that are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, it's claiming that the parent company, Malaysia Airlines, has the lowest equity in MAS Catering.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- For each subsidiary, their group's equity is listed. So for example, Abacus has 80% owned by the group (Malaysia Airlines), MAS Catering has 60%, and others have 100%.\n\nSo among all these subsidiaries, the one with the lowest equity is MAS Catering at 60%. The claim says that the parent company has the lowest equity in this particular subsidiary. But the parent's equity in it is 60%, which is correct because it's a subsidiary.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is misworded. It might be intended to say that among all the subsidiaries, the one with the lowest equity is MAS Catering, and that's true because 60% is lower than 80% and 100%.\n\nSo the user is asking whether the statement is correct, and in what way.\n\nThe original task was: \"You are tasked with determining whether a given statement is true or not.\"\n\nAssuming the statement is: \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\"\n\nBut looking at the table, the equity of the group in MAS Catering is 60%, which is less than the group's equity in Abacus (80%) and others. So the parent company holds a smaller percentage of MAS Catering compared to other subsidiaries. Therefore, among all the subsidiaries, the group has the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the equity percentages are for each subsidiary; the parent's ownership is fixed as 60% in this case.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is that within the subsidiaries, the parent company owns the smallest percentage in MAS Catering. So yes, among all the subsidiaries, the group's share in MAS Catering is the lowest (60%), while in others it's higher or equal.\n\nTherefore, the statement would be true if interpreted as: Among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, the equity shareholding by the parent company in MAS Catering is the lowest.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is that among all subsidiaries, the one with the lowest equity is MAS Catering, which is correct because 60% < 80% and others.\n\nSo depending on interpretation, it's true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd\" is **true**. This is because among all the subsidiaries listed, the group's equity shareholding in MAS Catering is the lowest at 60%, compared to other subsidiaries such as Abacus Distribution Systems (80%) and most others (100%). Therefore, the parent company holds the smallest percentage of ownership in MAS Catering within its subsidiaries.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is true.",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporated in india except taj madras air catering limit , which be not from india.\" So, according to this claim, all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines are incorporated in India, but there's one exception: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is not incorporated in India.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I need to verify whether each subsidiary and associate's incorporation aligns with this claim. The relevant columns here are \"company,\" \"type\" (which can be subsidiary or associate), \"incorporated in,\" and maybe \"group's equity shareholding.\" But since the claim is about incorporation, the key column is \"incorporated in.\"\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd**: Type is subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. So this doesn't apply because it's not in India.\n\n2. **GE Engine Services Malaysia**: Joint venture, incorporated in Malaysia. Again, not relevant for the claim.\n\n3. **Maswings Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, Malaysia. Not applicable.\n\n4. **Firefly Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, Malaysia. Not applicable.\n\n5. **MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, Malaysia. Not relevant.\n\n6. **MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, Malaysia. Not applicable.\n\n7. **Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, Malaysia. Not relevant.\n\n8. **MAS Academy Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, Malaysia. Not applicable.\n\n9. **Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Not relevant for the claim about India.\n\n10. **Taj Madras Air Catering Limited**: Associate, incorporated in India. The claim says this one isn't from India, but according to the table, it is. So this seems like a discrepancy.\n\n11. **MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd**: Subsidiary, Malaysia. Not relevant.\n\n12. **LSG Sky Chefs**: Associate, incorporated in Malaysia. Doesn't apply.\n\nSo, all subsidiaries and associates except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited are either from Malaysia or have their incorporation elsewhere, but the table shows that Taj Madras is incorporated in India. The claim states it's not from India, which contradicts the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's at least one counterexample where a subsidiary/associate is indeed incorporated in India (Taj Madras), and another associate (LSG Sky Chefs) is also from Malaysia.\n\nWait, but LSG Sky Chefs is an associate and it's incorporated in Malaysia, which aligns with the claim that all are not from India except Taj Madras. But the key point is that Taj Madras is from India according to the table, whereas the claim says it isn't. That's the main issue.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be the ones for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited because that's where the discrepancy lies.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and my analysis.\n\nThe claim states: \"Malaysia airline have 100% equity in each of their subsidiaries, like Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table lists several companies under the \"company\" column, along with their types (subsidiary, joint venture, etc.), principal activities, incorporation country, and equity shareholding.\n\nI need to find if Malaysia Airlines have 100% equity in all their subsidiaries. From the table, I see that Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary with 100% equity. Similarly, MASwings, Firefly, MAS Aerotechnologies, MAS Golden Holidays, Malaysian Aerospace Engineering, and MAS Academy are all subsidiaries with 100% equity.\n\nHowever, not all entries in the \"company\" column are directly under Malaysia Airlines. Some are joint ventures or associates, like GE Engine Services Malaysia (30%) and Taj Madras Air Catering Limited (20%). The claim specifically mentions Taj Madras as having 100% equity, but according to the table, it's an associate with only a 20% stake.\n\nAdditionally, some subsidiaries have varying equity shares. For example, Abacus Distribution Systems has an 80% share, which is less than 100%.\n\nTherefore, while Malaysia Airlines do have full ownership in many of their subsidiaries, not all of them have 100% equity, and the claim incorrectly states that Taj Madras has 100%, when it actually holds 20%. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if \"Malaysia airline\" owns 100% of each subsidiary listed in the table.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Subsidiaries:**\n   - The table lists several subsidiaries under \"company,\" such as Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd and MASwings Sdn Bhd, with equity shares of 100%.\n\n2. **Check Mentioned Company (Taj Madras):**\n   - Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is listed as an associate with a 20% equity share.\n\n3. **Determine Equity Percentage:**\n   - The claim states 100% equity in each subsidiary, but Taj Madras has only 20%.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since not all subsidiaries have 100% equity and the specific example given by the claim is incorrect, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Malaysia airline work with all subsidiary for cater except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Malaysia Airlines works with all their subsidiaries for catering services, but there's an exception with Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\n\nLooking at the table, I see various companies listed under \"company,\" their types, activities, incorporation details, and equity shareholding. My goal is to check if Malaysia Airlines uses all subsidiaries for catering except for Taj Madras Air Catering.\n\nFrom the table, I can see that Malaysia Airlines has several subsidiaries like Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd, MASwings Sdn Bhd, Firefly Sdn Bhd, etc., each with 100% equity. The term \"cater\" likely refers to catering services. I need to check if these subsidiaries are involved in catering.\n\nMAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd is listed as a subsidiary providing catering services and has an equity share of 60%. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, on the other hand, is categorized under \"associate\" with a 20% equity. So it's a different type\u2014associate rather than subsidiary.\n\nNow, the claim says that all subsidiaries are used for catering except Taj Madras. Let's check each relevant row:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, activity includes cargo. Not catering.\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia: joint venture, engine overhaul. Not catering.\n3. MASwings Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, airline. Not catering.\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, airline. Not catering.\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, MRO. Not catering.\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, tour operator. Not catering.\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, engineering. Not catering.\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, flight school. Not catering.\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, computer reservation system. Not catering.\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: associate, catering. It is an associate, not a subsidiary.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"except Taj Madras Air Catering limit\" which is correct because it's not a subsidiary. However, I need to ensure that all subsidiaries are used for catering except this one.\n\nLooking at the table, MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary involved in catering, with 60% equity. So, does Malaysia Airlines use its other subsidiaries for catering? From the list above, most subsidiaries don't provide catering services. Only Abacus Distribution Systems provides a computer reservation system, which might be related to catering indirectly, but not directly as a service provider.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The relevant columns are \"company,\" \"type,\" and \"principal activities.\" So, for catering, we should look at rows where the principal activity is catering.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, catering.\n- Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: associate, catering.\n\nSo, only these two companies in the table are involved in catering. The rest of the subsidiaries listed don't provide catering services directly. Therefore, the claim is stating that all subsidiaries (except Taj Madras, which isn't a subsidiary) are used for catering. But since other subsidiaries aren't involved in catering, does this make the claim false?\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"Malaysia airline work with all subsidiary for cater except Taj Madras Air Catering limit.\" So, it's about the subsidiaries that provide catering services. Only two companies in the table do: MAS Catering (Sarawak) and Taj Madras, but the latter is an associate.\n\nSo, if the claim says Malaysia Airlines works with all their subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras, which isn't a subsidiary, then it's correct because only MAS Catering is a subsidiary involved in catering. Therefore, the statement is TRUE because all subsidiaries (except those not involved in catering) are used, and the only exception is Taj Madras, which isn't a subsidiary.\n\nBut wait, the claim might be suggesting that all subsidiaries are used for catering except Taj Madras. From the table, it seems that only MAS Catering is a subsidiary involved in catering. So if there are other subsidiaries not providing catering services, then technically, the statement is TRUE because they are not using them for catering either. The exception is Taj Madras, which isn't even a subsidiary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering that all subsidiaries except Taj Madras are used for catering, but since other subsidiaries aren't involved in catering, it's still correct as they don't work with them for catering. Therefore, the statement holds true because it's only excluding Taj Madras, which isn't part of the subsidiaries.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to check would be the ones where the company is a subsidiary and principal activity is catering, and also the one that's an associate but provides catering services.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: row 9, columns type, principal activities.\n2. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: row 10, columns type and equity shareholding.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"except Taj Madras,\" so that's the only one excluded. The other subsidiaries not involved in catering don't need to be checked because they're not used for catering anyway. So, the relevant cells are where company is a subsidiary and provides catering services, and the associate providing catering.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check which companies are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines involved in catering services and whether Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an exception as per the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** We focus on the columns \"company,\" \"type,\" and \"principal activities\" to determine which subsidiaries provide catering services.\n2. **Check for Catering Services in Subsidiaries:**\n   - MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: Type - subsidiary, Principal Activity - catering.\n3. **Identify Non-Subsidiary Catering Provider:** Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is categorized as an \"associate,\" not a subsidiary.\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim states that all subsidiaries are used for catering except Taj Madras. Since only MAS Catering is a subsidiary involved in catering, and Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary, the claim holds TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd at row 9.\n- Taj Madras Air Catering Limited at row 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"company\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"company\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Malaysia Airlines have equal equity in each subsidiary\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's suggesting that Malaysia Airlines has an equal share in every listed subsidiary.\n\nLooking at the table, I see various companies under different types like subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, etc. Each of these companies might be part of the group structure, and the \"group 's equity shareholding\" column shows the percentage each has in the parent company or group.\n\nFirst, I'll check what Malaysia Airlines' role is. Wait, actually, the table lists companies like Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd as subsidiaries with 100% equity. But wait, I'm not sure if that's Malaysia Airlines itself or a different entity. Maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the parent company is MAS, which might be involved in multiple subsidiaries through various names. So, for example, MASwings, Firefly, etc., are subsidiaries with 100% equity each. Then there are other companies like Taj Madras and LSG Sky Chefs which are associates with different percentages.\n\nSo, to check if Malaysia Airlines have equal equity in each subsidiary, I need to identify which companies are considered part of Malaysia Airlines or their group. It's possible that the subsidiaries listed under \"Malaysia\" are all 100% owned by MAS or its subsidiaries, but other entries like Taj Madras and LSG Sky Chefs might be part of different groups.\n\nWait, looking at the table again: the company names include \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd,\" which is a subsidiary. Then there's \"mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd\" as a subsidiary with 100% equity. So perhaps these are all under Malaysia Airlines Group or related.\n\nBut then, in row 8, we have \"mas academy sdn bhd\" as a subsidiary, and so on. However, the term \"Malaysia Airlines\" might refer to the main company, which is likely MAS, but in the table, the main company isn't listed. The first row lists Malaysia Airlines Cargo as a subsidiary.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the claim refers to whether each subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines has equal equity, not that Malaysia Airlines itself owns each with equal shares. Or maybe it's about whether Malaysia Airlines holds equal shares across all subsidiaries.\n\nAlternatively, the term \"Malaysia Airlines\" might be referring to the main company, which is MAS, and in the table, several companies are listed under \"type\" as subsidiary. So for example, Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd (row 0) is a subsidiary of MAS with 100% equity. Similarly, other rows have subsidiaries with varying percentages.\n\nBut the claim says \"Malaysia airline have equal equity in each subsidy.\" Maybe it's about whether each listed company in the table has an equal percentage ownership by Malaysia Airlines. But looking at the table, some companies like Taj Madras Air Catering (row 9) are associates with only 20% equity. Others like Mas Academy (row 8) have 100%, and Abacus Distribution (row 10) is 80%.\n\nSo if the claim is that \"Malaysia Airlines\" has equal equity in each company listed, then it's false because the percentages vary across the table. For instance, some are 100%, others are 20%, 30%, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to clarify whether all these companies are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines or part of their group. For example, companies like Taj Madras and LSG Sky Chefs might be associated with other groups or different parent companies. So the claim is about having equal equity in each listed subsidiary, which they don't because some have 100%, others less.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all rows where the type is subsidiary and the company name might relate to Malaysia Airlines. So looking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n- Row1: GE Engine Services Malaysia - joint venture, not subsidiary\n- Row2: MASwings Sdn Bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n- Row3: Firefly Sdn Bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n- Row4: MAS Aerotech... - subsidiary, 100%\n- Row5: MAS Golden Holidays - subsidiary, 100%\n- Row6: Malaysian Aerospace Eng - subsidiary, 100%\n- Row7: MAS Academy - subsidiary, 100%\n- Row8: Abacus Distribution - subsidiary, 80%\n- Rows9 and10 are associates.\n\nSo for the claim, only the subsidiaries would matter. Among them, some have 100%, some have 80%. Therefore, the equity isn't equal across all listed companies. So the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}, {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}, {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}, {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}, {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}, {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}, {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}, {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"group 's equity shareholding\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that there are no Malaysian airlines that hold a 30% equity shareholding in any associates listed in the table. So I need to check each row related to \"Malaysia airline\" and their equity shares in any associated companies.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows where \"company\" is either \"Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd\", \"GE Engine Services Malaysia\", etc. Wait, actually, the first column lists the company names. So the claim mentions \"Malaysia airline,\" which probably refers to companies under the Malaysia Airlines group.\n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see a row where the company is explicitly named as \"Malaysia Airlines.\" The closest ones are \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd\", \"maswings sdn bhd\", etc. Maybe those are subsidiaries or associates of Malaysia Airlines.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate.\" So I need to check if any of the companies listed under the table hold a 30% equity shareholding in any of the associates (third column).\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia, 100% equity.\n2. ge engine services malaysia - joint venture, 30% equity.\n3. maswings sdn bhd - subsidiary, airline, 100%.\n4. firefly sdn bhd - subsidiary, airline, 100%.\n5. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - subsidiary, MRO, 100%.\n6. mas golden holidays sdn bhd - subsidiary, tour operator, 100%.\n7. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - subsidiary, engineering, 100%.\n8. mas academy sdn bhd - subsidiary, flight school, 100%.\n9. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - subsidiary, computer reservation system, 80% equity.\n10. taj madras air catering limited - associate, catering, 20% equity.\n11. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - subsidiary, catering, 60% equity.\n12. lsg sky chefs - associate, holding company, 30% equity.\n\nNow, the claim is about \"Malaysia airline\" having a 30% shareholding in none of the associates. So I need to look for any instance where a Malaysia airline (which might be a parent company) has a 30% stake in an associate.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- The first row: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd is a subsidiary, so it's not an associate. Equity is 100%, which doesn't match 30%.\n- Second row: GE Engine Services Malaysia is a joint venture with 30% equity, but the parent company isn't listed as a Malaysia airline.\n- Third to ninth rows: These are subsidiaries or associates, and their equity is either 100%, 80%, etc., not 30%. The parents here aren't explicitly \"Malaysia Airlines\" though.\n- Tenth row: taj madras air catering limited is an associate with 20% equity. The parent isn't Malaysia Airlines.\n- Eleventh row: mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd is a subsidiary, so not an associate.\n- Twelfth row: lsg sky chefs is an associate with 30% equity.\n\nWait, the twelfth row says lsg sky chefs are associates with 30% equity. The parent company for this is listed as Malaysia. So does \"Malaysia airline\" refer to the parent company? If so, then the claim would be incorrect because lsg sky chefs have a 30% shareholding through the associate.\n\nBut wait, in row 12, the group's equity shareholding is 30%. That means the parent (Malaysia) owns 30% of lsg sky chefs. But lsg sky chefs are listed as an associate, so according to the claim, Malaysia airline shouldn't have a 30% share in any associates.\n\nHowever, looking at the rows again, perhaps \"Malaysia airline\" refers specifically to companies like Malaysia Airlines (MAS), which isn't directly listed here but has subsidiaries. But the table doesn't show MAS itself; it shows subsidiaries and their equity shares.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about whether any of the associates are 30% owned by a \"Malaysia airline.\" So in row 12, lsg sky chefs have a 30% shareholding from the group (Malaysia). But since they're an associate, that means the parent company (Malaysia) has a 30% stake. Therefore, there is at least one associate where Malaysia airline holds a 30% share.\n\nBut in row 12, lsg sky chefs are listed as associates with 30% equity from the group, which is Malaysia. So yes, this would contradict the claim that \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines do not hold a 30% equity shareholding in any associates listed in the table. However, row 12 indicates that lsg sky chefs are an associate with a 30% equity shareholding from the group (Malaysia). This directly contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
