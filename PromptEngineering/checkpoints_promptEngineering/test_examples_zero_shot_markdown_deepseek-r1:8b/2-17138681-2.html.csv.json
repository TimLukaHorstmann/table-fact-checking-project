Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8.\" So I need to check if any row in the table has a rating/share of 3.2/8 and a viewers count greater than 12.42 million.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify which rows have \"rating / share\" equal to 3.2/8. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first entry is 5.4/9 with 9.2 viewers.\n- Then 4.4/7 with 7.81 viewers.\n- Next, 6.6/11 with 10.6 viewers.\n- 6.1/10 and 5.9/10 both have 3.1/8, not 3.2/8.\n- 7.2/11 has 12.42 viewers but the rating/share is 3.2/8? Wait, no, let me check that again.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nFor row 0: 5.4, 9, and rating/share is 2.6/7. So not 3.2/8.\n\nRow 1: 4.4, 7, 2.6/6. No.\n\nRow 2: 6.6,11,3.0/8. Close but not 3.2.\n\nRow3:6.1,10,3.1/8. Still not matching.\n\nRow4:5.9,10,3.1/8.\n\nRow5:7.2,11,3.2/8. Wait, yes! Here we go. So row index 5 has rating/share of 3.2/8.\n\nNow, let's check the viewers for this row. It says 12.42 million viewers.\n\nThe claim is whether there are more than 12.42 million viewers for that entry. The viewers here are exactly 12.42 million, not more than that. So does \"more than\" include equal? Probably not. So it's exactly 12.42, which doesn't meet the condition of more than.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's another row with 3.2/8 and higher viewers.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow6:7.1,11,3.8/10. No match.\n\nRow7:6.2,10,2.9/8. Not matching.\n\nRows 8-10 have n/a for rating/share, so not relevant.\n\nRow11:7.6,10, n/a. So the only row with 3.2/8 is row5, which has viewers of exactly 12.42 million.\n\nSo the claim says \"more than 12.42\", but the actual viewers are equal to that number. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me make sure I'm interpreting the table correctly. The \"rating / share\" column for row5 is indeed 3.2/8, and the viewers are 12.42 million.\n\nSo the claim says there's an entry with rating/share 3.2/8 and viewers >12.42. But in reality, the viewers are exactly 12.42, so it's not more than that. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait another thing: maybe I misread row numbers? Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow0: 5.4,9\nRow1:4.4,7\nRow2:6.6,11\nRow3:6.1,10\nRow4:5.9,10\nRow5:7.2,11\nWait, wait no, row5 is 7.2,11 and rating/share is 3.2/8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So viewers are 12.42 million.\n\nThus, the claim says more than 12.42 for this entry, but it's exactly 12.42. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing another row? Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row0: 5.4,9,2.6/7\n- Row1:4.4,7,2.6/6\n- Row2:6.6,11,3.0/8\n- Row3:6.1,10,3.1/8\n- Row4:5.9,10,3.1/8\n- Row5:7.2,11,3.2/8 (viewers 12.42)\n- Row6:7.1,11,3.8/10\n- Row7:6.2,10,2.9/8\n- Row8:6.1,10,n/a\n- Row9:6,10,n/a\n- Row10:6.8,9,2.0/7\n- Row11:7.6,10,n/a\n\nSo only row5 matches the rating/share 3.2/8 with viewers exactly 12.42 million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is saying that there exists an entry where viewers are more than 12.42 for this specific rating/share, but it's not true because they're equal.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is checking if any entry with a rating/share of 3.2/8 has more than 12.42 million viewers. From the table, only one row matches this rating/share (row5) and its viewers are exactly 12.42 million, not exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: FALSE\n\nRelevant cells: Only row5's \"viewers\" column needs checking.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
