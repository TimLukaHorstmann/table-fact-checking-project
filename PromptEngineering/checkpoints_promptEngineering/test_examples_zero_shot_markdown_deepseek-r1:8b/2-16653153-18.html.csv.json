    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is about a game score between Sydney Spirit and South Dragons on November 29th being 103 - 94.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and find the relevant information. The table has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. Since the claim is about a specific game's score, the key columns are \"date\" and \"score.\"\n\nI'll start by looking for the date November 29th in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that there are multiple games on November 29th. The fifth row (index 4) is Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons with a score of 103 - 94. Wait, but let me check each game to make sure.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 0: November 26, South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans\n- Row 1: November 26, Townsville Crocodiles vs Melbourne Tigers\n- Row 2: November 27, New Zealand Breakers vs Perth Wildcats\n- Row 3: November 29, Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks\n- Row 4: November 29, Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles\n- Row 5: November 29, Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers\n- Row 6: November 29, Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers\n- Row 7: November 29, Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons\n\nSo the game on November 29th between Sydney Spirit (home team) and South Dragons (away team) is in row 7. The score there is 103 - 94, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"melbourne tiger be the away team that play home team of perth wildcat on the 29 november.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two teams: Melbourne Tigers as the away team and Perth Wildcats as the home team. The game is supposed to take place on November 29.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any matches that fit this description. Each row in the table represents a game with specific details like date, home team, score, etc.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Date is November 26. Not our date.\n2. **Row 1:** Date is November 26. Again, not November 29.\n3. **Row 2:** Date is November 27. Still not the right date.\n4. **Row 3:** Date is November 29. This matches the claim's date.\n   - Home team: Adelaide 36ers\n   - Away team: Wollongong Hawks\n   So, this game doesn't involve Melbourne Tigers or Perth Wildcats.\n\n5. **Row 4:** November 29 again.\n   - Home team: Cairns Taipans\n   - Away team: Townsville Crocodiles\n   Not the teams in question.\n\n6. **Row 5:** November 29.\n   - Home team: Gold Coast Blaze\n   - Away team: New Zealand Breakers\n   Nope, not Melbourne or Perth.\n\n7. **Row 6:** November 29.\n   - Home team: Perth Wildcats\n   - Away team: Melbourne Tigers\n   Wait, this is the match we need. The home team here is Perth Wildcats, and the away team is Melbourne Tigers.\n\n8. **Row 7:** November 29.\n   - Home team: Sydney Spirit\n   - Away team: South Dragons\n   Not relevant.\n\nSo in row 6, on November 29, Perth Wildcats are playing as the home team against Melbourne Tigers. The claim says that Melbourne Tigers are the away team playing against Perth Wildcats, which is exactly what's happening here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. I need to list the cells that support this. Each relevant cell should be identified by their row index and column name.\n\nLooking back at the table structure:\n\n- \"date\" is in column 0.\n- \"home team\" is column 2.\n- \"away team\" is column 4.\n- The date in question is November 29, which is row 6.\n\nSo, for row_index=6:\n- Column \"date\" to check the date.\n- Column \"home team\" to see it's Perth Wildcats.\n- Column \"away team\" to confirm it's Melbourne Tigers.\n\nI think that's all. So the relevant_cells would be row 6, columns: date, home team, away team.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the november 29 melbourne tiger game be in the state sport centre venue.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe key elements are:\n1. Date: November 29.\n2. Team: Melbourne Tigers.\n3. Venue: State Sport Centre.\n\nI need to check if there's a game on November 29 where the Melbourne Tigers played at the State Sport Centre.\n\nLooking at the table, I should go through each row and see if any match these criteria.\n\nLet me list out all the games:\n\n1. November 26: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans - Hisense Arena.\n2. November 26: Townsville Crocodiles vs Melbourne Tigers - Townsville Entertainment Centre.\n3. November 27: New Zealand Breakers vs Perth Wildcats - North Shore Events Centre.\n4. November 29: Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks - Distinctive Homes Dome.\n5. November 29: Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles - Cairns Convention Centre.\n6. November 29: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers - Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n7. November 29: Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers - Marrara Stadium.\n8. November 29: Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons - State Sports Centre.\n\nNow, looking for the game on November 29 where Melbourne Tigers played. The 7th row has Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers on November 29 at Marrara Stadium. That's not the State Sports Centre.\n\nWait, but there is another game on November 29: Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons at State Sports Centre. But that's a different team, so it doesn't involve Melbourne Tigers.\n\nSo, in all the games on November 29, Melbourne Tigers are playing against Perth Wildcats at Marrara Stadium, not the State Sports Centre.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the game on November 29 involving Melbourne Tigers wasn't held at the State Sport Centre. Instead, they played elsewhere.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, I check each relevant row for the date and team mentioned in the claim. The claim specifies November 29 and the Melbourne Tigers. Reviewing the table:\n\n- **November 29**: Only one game features the Melbourne Tigers vs. Perth Wildcats at Marrara Stadium.\n\nNo match on November 29 between Melbourne Tigers and any opponent is held at the State Sports Centre. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
