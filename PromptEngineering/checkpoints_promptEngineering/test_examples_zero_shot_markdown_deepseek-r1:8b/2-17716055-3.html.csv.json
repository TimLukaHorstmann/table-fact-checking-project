    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"there have been no player drawn with 1 of 51 points and a number of loss larger than 5.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this claim means. It seems like it's referring to players (or teams) that have exactly 1 point from 51 possible points but also have more than 5 losses. Wait, actually, the term \"player drawn with 1 of 51\" is a bit unclear. Maybe it's about a player who has been drawn in 1 out of 51 matches or something similar? Or perhaps it's referring to teams that have exactly one point out of 51 possible points and more than five losses.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team with various statistics: played games, drawn games, lost games, goals for, against, goal difference, and points. So \"points\" seem to be the key here since the claim mentions 51 points. \n\nWait, in the table, I see the column labeled \"points 1.\" Maybe that's a typo or shorthand. It could mean points per game, but more likely, it refers to total points. So for each team, their total points are listed.\n\nThe claim is saying there have been no teams with exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses. Alternatively, maybe it's saying no player has drawn exactly one match out of 51 possible draws, which doesn't make much sense because the number of games played is fixed at 34 for each team. So that interpretation might not fit.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps \"1 of 51\" refers to a single point in a game where 51 points were up for grabs. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Alternatively, it could be that a player has been involved in a draw where the total points at stake were 51, but again, this is speculative.\n\nLooking back at the table, I'll focus on the \"points\" column and the \"lost\" column to see if any team meets both conditions: having exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about a player who has drawn once in 51 matches, but since each team plays 34 games, that seems off.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n- Row 1: Colne Dynamoes have 55 points, 4 lost. 4 \u22645, so not relevant.\n- Row 2: Warrington Town have 54 points, 4 lost. Same here.\n- Row3: Clitheroe has 51 points, 5 lost. So exactly 51 points and 5 losses. Wait, the claim says \"no player with 1 of 51 and more than 5 loss.\" So this team has exactly 51 points and exactly 5 losses. Since 5 is not more than 5, it doesn't meet the condition.\n- Row4: Prestwich Heys have 47, 5 lost. No.\n- Row5: Vulcan Newton has 36,11 lost. Doesn't reach 51.\n- Row6: Blackpool Mechanics have 35,10 lost. No.\n- Row7: Bacup Borough has 35,13 lost. No.\n- Row8: Atherton Collieries have 35,11 lost. No.\n- Row9: Whitworth Valley has 35,12 lost. No.\n- Row10: Nelson has28,11 lost. No.\n- Row11: Daisy Hill has30,14 lost. No.\n- Row12: Maghull has29,15 lost. No.\n- Row13: Ashton Town has29,17 lost. No.\n- Row14: Newton has28,14 lost. No.\n- Row15: Oldham Dew has28,16 lost. No.\n- Row16: Bolton St has24,19 lost. No.\n- Row17: Wigan Rovers have17,22 lost. No.\n- Row18: Ashton Athletic has14,23 lost. No.\n\nSo none of the teams have exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses. Wait, but in row3, Clitheroe has 51 points and 5 losses, which is not more than 5. So no team meets both criteria. Therefore, the claim that \"there have been no player drawn with 1 of 51 points and a number of loss larger than 5\" would be TRUE because there are no such players or teams in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misinterpreted \"player drawn.\" Perhaps it's about draws where the team has exactly one draw out of 51 possible. But each team plays 34 games, so 51 doesn't make sense here. Alternatively, if a player has been involved in exactly one draw across all their matches, that might be another angle, but again, the numbers don't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"player drawn\" refers to a situation where a player was part of a draw with a total of 51 points at stake, but that's unclear. Given the table's columns, it's more likely about the team's points and losses. Since no team has exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses, the statement holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that there have been no teams in the provided data with exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses. Analyzing each team's performance:\n\n- **Clitheroe** has the highest points (51) but also exactly 5 losses, which does not meet the condition of more than 5.\n- No other team reaches 51 points or has more than 5 losses simultaneously.\n\nThus, the statement is verified as true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true because no teams in the dataset have both exactly 51 points and more than five losses.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read through the claim again: \"there be no drawn that have point 1 of 49 and a lost larger than 3.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two specific conditions for a \"drawn\" (which I think refers to a team in the table). \n\n1. The drawn has points (probably points in column \"points 1\") equal to 49.\n2. The lost (column \"lost\") is larger than 3.\n\nSo, the claim says that there should be no such teams that meet both these conditions. Therefore, I need to check each team in the table to see if any have points 1 of exactly 49 and a lost count greater than 3.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one, focusing on the \"points 1\" column (I think it's labeled as \"points 1\") and the \"lost\" column. \n\nLet me start from the top:\n\n- Row 1: points 1 is 55, lost is 4. Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: points 1 is 54, lost is 4. No.\n- Row 3: points 1 is 51, lost is 5. Not matching.\n- Row 4: points 1 is 47, lost is 5. No.\n- Row 5: points 1 is 36, lost is 11. Doesn't fit.\n- Row 6: points 1 is 35, lost is 10. Still no.\n- Row 7: points 1 is 35, lost is 13. Nope.\n- Row 8: points 1 is 35, lost is 11. Not it.\n- Row 9: points 1 is 35, lost is 12. No match.\n- Row 10: points 1 is 28, lost is 11. Doesn't fit.\n- Row 11: points 1 is 30, lost is 14. Not matching.\n- Row 12: points 1 is 29, lost is 15. Nope.\n- Row 13: points 1 is 29, lost is 17. Doesn't fit.\n- Row 14: points 1 is 28, lost is 14. No.\n- Row 15: points 1 is 28, lost is 16. Doesn't match.\n- Row 16: points 1 is 24, lost is 19. Not applicable.\n- Row 17: points 1 is 17, lost is 22. Nope.\n- Row 18: points 1 is 14, lost is 23. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait a minute, I just realized that the points 1 column might be labeled as \"points\" instead of \"points 1\". Let me double-check the table headers. The last column is labeled \"points 1\", so it's definitely points 1, not another metric. So my initial assumption was correct.\n\nNow, scanning through all the rows, I don't see any team with points 1 equal to 49. The highest points 1 in the table seems to be 55 for Colne Dynamoes. So, there are no teams with points 1 of exactly 49. \n\nSince the claim states that there should be no such drawn (team) with points 1 of 49 and a lost count larger than 3, but since there's no team with points 1 of 49 at all, this condition is trivially true. There can't be any teams meeting both criteria because none meet one of them.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
