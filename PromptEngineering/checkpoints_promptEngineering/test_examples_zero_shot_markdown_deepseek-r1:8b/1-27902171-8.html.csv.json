    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game on march 19 have a score of 112 - 91\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the task entails.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, etc. Each row represents a different game. My goal is to verify if the specific claim matches any of these games accurately.\n\nThe claim mentions a game on March 19 with a score of 112 - 91. So I need to find the corresponding row in the table where the date is March 19 and check if the score matches this value.\n\nLooking at the table, each row starts with the game number. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Game 58: March 1\n- Game 59: March 3\n- Game 60: March 5\n- Game 61: March 7\n- Game 62: March 8\n- Game 63: March 10\n- Game 64: March 11\n- Game 65: March 15\n- Game 66: March 17\n- Game 67: March 19\n\nAh, here we go. Game 67 is on March 19. Now I need to check the score for this game.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column for game 67: It's listed as \"w 112 - 91\". So the score is indeed 112 - 91, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all the specified conditions are met in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says: \"the team with a record of 34 - 27 have 7 high assist by n mcmillan.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the record is exactly 34 - 27. Scanning through the table, I see that there are two such entries. Wait, no\u2014looking again, each row has a unique game number and different dates. Let me check each one:\n\n- Game 62: March 8, Portland Trail Blazers, record 34 - 28. Not 34-27.\n- Game 63: March 10, Detroit Pistons, record 34 - 29. No.\n- Game 64: March 11, LA Clippers, 35 - 29. No.\n- Game 65: March 15, Dallas Mavericks, 36 - 29. No.\n- Game 66: March 17, Golden State Warriors, 36 - 30. No.\n- Game 67: March 19, Houston Rockets, 37 - 30. No.\n- Game 68: March 21, San Antonio Spurs, 37 - 31. No.\n- Game 69: March 22, Dallas Mavericks, 38 - 31. No.\n- Game 70: March 24, Houston Rockets, 39 - 31. No.\n- Game 71: March 27, Milwaukee Bucks, 40 - 31. No.\n- Game 72: March 28, NY Knicks, 40 - 32. No.\n\nWait a minute, I might have missed it. Let me go row by row:\n\nGame 58: Record 32-26\nGame 59: 33-26\nGame 60: 33-27\nAh, here's one! Game 60, March 5, Phoenix Suns, record 33 - 27. So that's the team with 33-27.\n\nThe claim says \"the team with a record of 34 - 27,\" but this is 33-27. Wait, maybe I need to double-check if there's another game with 34-27. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n- Game 58: 32\n- 59:33\n-60:33\n-61:34-27? No, game 61 is 34-27 but that's after March 7, and the record is 34-27. Wait, no, game 61 has a record of 34 -27. So actually, there are two teams with 34-27?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nGame 60: Phoenix Suns, l 105 -118, score, and record is 33-27.\n\nGame 61: March 7, New Jersey Nets, w 109-98. Record is 34 -27.\n\nSo two teams have 34-27? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see:\n\nEach row has a 'record' column. Game 60: 33-27, game 61: 34-27, game 62: 34-28, etc.\n\nWait no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's list out all the records:\n\nGame 58: 32 -26\n59:33-26\n60:33-27\n61:34-27\n62:34-28\n63:34-29\n64:35-29\n65:36-29\n66:36-30\n67:37-30\n68:37-31\n69:38-31\n70:39-31\n71:40-31\n72:40-32\n\nSo, the team with a record of 34 -27 is only in Game 61. So the claim refers to the team with 34-27.\n\nNow, looking at that row (Game 61), what's the high assist?\n\nIn the 'high assist' column, for game 61, it says \"7 high assist by n mcmillan.\" Wait, no\u2014the table shows each row has a 'high assist' value. Let me check Game 61:\n\nLooking back at the table: Game 61 is March 7, New Jersey Nets, with record 34-27.\n\nIn that row, under 'high assist', it says \"7 high assist by n mcmillan.\" So yes, the team has a high assist of 7 by N Mccollin? Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table, each game's data includes a 'high assist' entry. For Game 61, it says \"7 high assist by n mcmillan.\"\n\nSo yes, that team (34-27) has 7 high assists by N Mccollin.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct: the team with record 34-27 has 7 high assists by N Mccollin.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"high assist\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"golden state warrior be the name of the team when the location attendance be hemisfair arena 16057.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's saying two things:\n1. The team's name is \"golden state warrior.\"\n2. The location attendance is at \"hemisfair arena\" with a number of 16057.\n\nI need to check if there's any row in the table where both these conditions are met. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from row 58, I see the team is the Cleveland Cavaliers. Not matching. Then row 59: Denver Nuggets. Nope. Row 60: Phoenix Suns. Still no. Moving on, row 61: New Jersey Nets. Doesn't fit. Next, row 62: Portland Trail Blazers. No match.\n\nContinuing, row 63: Detroit Pistons. Not it. Row 64: Los Angeles Clippers. No. Then row 65: Dallas Mavericks. Nope. Row 66: Golden State Warriors. Oh, wait! The team's name here is \"golden state warriors,\" which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow check the location attendance for this game. According to row 66, the location is San Francisco (probably) but the venue listed is Seattle Center Coliseum with an attendance of 13163. Wait, that doesn't match the hemisfair arena number given in the claim, which is 16057. So even though the team name matches, the location and attendance numbers don't.\n\nI should check all rows to make sure there's no other game where \"golden state warriors\" play at \"hemisfair arena\" with that attendance. Let me scan through the rest of the table quickly. The next row is 67: Houston Rockets, not relevant. Row 68: San Antonio Spurs. No. Then 69: Dallas Mavericks. 70: Houston Rockets again. 71: Milwaukee Bucks. 72: New York Knicks.\n\nNone of these rows have \"golden state warriors\" as the team and hemisfair arena with 16057 attendance. So even though row 66 has the correct team name, the location doesn't match the required one. Therefore, the claim is false because both conditions aren't met in any single row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a specific team (\"golden state warrior\") plays at \"hemisfair arena\" with an attendance of 16057. However, upon examining each table row:\n\n- The only row where \"golden state warriors\" are listed is **row 66**, but it's at \"seattle center coliseum\" with 13163 attendees.\n- No other rows match both the team name and location criteria.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by any single row in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"the total number of high assist (8) for g payton occur at the game on march 10.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim means. It mentions two specific things:\n\n1. There was a game where G Payton had 8 high assists.\n2. That game took place on March 10.\n\nSo, I need to find in the table if there's a row corresponding to March 10 (game date) where G Payton has an assist count of 8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details. The columns relevant here are:\n\n- date\n- high assists\n\nI should focus on these two columns to check the claim.\n\nStarting by looking for the game on March 10. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\nRow 63: march 10\n\nThat's the row we need because it's the game on March 10.\n\nNow, checking the 'high assists' for that game. In row 63, under high assists, it says g payton (9). So G Payton had 9 assists in that game.\n\nBut the claim states that the total number of high assist was 8 for G Payton in that game. That doesn't match because the actual number is 9, not 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it's claiming there were 8 assists when there were actually 9.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the date for score of w 112 - 91 be after march 19\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two things: the date and the score of a game where the result was a win (w) by a score of 112-91. Then it states that this date should be after March 19.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the row where the score is w 112 - 91. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 58: Score is w 113 - 107. Not matching.\nRow 59: w 111 - 92. No.\nRow 60: l 105 - 118. Loss, so not relevant for a win.\nRow 61: w 109 - 98. Different score.\nRow 62: l 97 - 109. Loss again.\nRow 63: l 92 - 98. Another loss.\nRow 64: w 104 - 96. Not matching.\nRow 65: w 109 - 100. Not 112-91.\nRow 66: l 107 - 119. Loss.\nRow 67: w 112 - 91. Ah, here we go! This is the game where they won with a score of 112-91.\n\nNow, I need to check the date for this game. According to the table, row 67 (since it's the 7th row in markdown, but let me count: starting from 58 as the first, so 58,59,...67 is the 10th row, but row_index starts at 0 perhaps? Wait, looking back at the instructions, the example uses row indexes like 0,1. So probably each row is numbered starting at 0.\n\nWait, let me look at the table structure:\n\nThe first row is game 58, then 59, etc., up to 72. So in the JSON response, the relevant_cells are supposed to have \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". The rows in the table correspond to each game, so I think the row index would be based on their position in the table.\n\nBut in any case, for this claim, we're focusing on the game where they scored 112-91 as a win. That's row 67 (since starting from 58, adding up: 58,59,60,...67 is the 10th entry). But in the JSON example, it seems like row_index starts at 0, so perhaps each game is listed in order, and row 67 would be index 9 if starting from 0. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nThe table shows:\n\ngame | date     | team ... etc.\n\nSo each row corresponds to a specific game. The first game (row 58) is the first one in the table. So row_index would start at 0 for game 58, 1 for game 59, up to row 69 as index 11? Wait, no: the games go from 58 to 72, which is 15 games. So rows are 15 in total, so indexes 0-14.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, the first column is \"game\" with values starting at 58 and incrementing by 1 each row. The last game is 72. So there are 15 games (72 - 58 + 1 = 15). Therefore, row indices would be from 0 to 14, corresponding to games 58-72.\n\nBut in the table provided, let's count:\n\nRow 1: game 58\n\n...\n\nRow 9: game 67 (since 58+9=67)\n\nWait no, because 58 is the first, so row_index 0 is 58, row_index 1 is 59, up to row_index 14 being 72.\n\nSo for game 67, it's row index 9 (because 58 + 9 = 67).\n\nNow, checking the date for this game: in row index 9 (game 67), the date is \"March 19\". The claim says that the date should be after March 19. But here, the date is exactly March 19. So does \"after\" include the same day? Typically, \"after\" would mean strictly after, so after March 19 would be March 20 or later.\n\nTherefore, if the game was on March 19, it's not after March 19. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nSo to verify, I need to check which cells are relevant. The claim talks about two things: the date and the score (w 112-91). Therefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n1. The row where the game was played on or after March 19. But actually, since it's exactly March 19, maybe we don't need to go further. Alternatively, perhaps just checking that there is a game with w 112-91 and its date.\n\nWait, but in this case, the claim is about a specific score (w 112-91) having a date after March 19. So I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- The row where the score is w 112 -91: which is row index 9 (game 67), column \"date\", and also the same row's \"score\" column to confirm the score.\n\nWait, but in the JSON example, it only includes two columns. So maybe for this claim, we need to check both the date and the score.\n\nSo relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For the game where the score is w 112 -91: find that row (row index 9) and note the \"date\" column (March 19) and perhaps the \"score\" column? Or maybe just the date, as the claim is about the date being after March 19.\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically about the date for that score. So I think it's sufficient to look at the row where the game was w 112 -91 and check its date.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For the game with score w 112 -91: find its row index (9) and check the \"date\" column.\n\nTherefore, in JSON, the relevant_cells would include {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"date\"}.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps checking that the score is indeed w 112-91, but since the claim is about the date, maybe it's enough to check the date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both cells are needed because the claim mentions both the score and the date.\n\nWait, the claim says: \"the date for score of w 112 - 91 be after march 19\". So it's tying the date to that specific score. Therefore, we need to confirm two things:\n\n1. There is a game with the score w 112-91.\n\n2. The date of that game is after March 19.\n\nBut looking at the table, the only game with a score of w 112 -91 is on March 19. So it's not after March 19; it's exactly on March 19.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- Find the row where the game was w 112 -91: that's row index 9 (game 67).\n\n- Check its date: March 19.\n\nSince March 19 is not after March 19, the claim is false.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nThe relevant cells are the row for game 67 and the date column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
