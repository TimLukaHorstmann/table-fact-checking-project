The relevant columns are 'theme,' 'song choice,' and 'original artist.'\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Audition**: Theme is \"auditioner's choice,\" song is \"last,\" artist is Glenn Miller. Doesn't match.\n\n2. **Hollywood - First solo performance**: Theme is \"first solo performance,\" song is \"for once in my life,\" artist is Stevie Wonder. This matches the claim exactly.\n\n3. **Hollywood - Group performance**: Song is \"no one.\" Not relevant.\n\n4. **Hollywood - Second solo**: Song is \"chasing pavements.\" Doesn't match.\n\n5. **Top 24 (12 women)**: Song is \"feeling good.\" No match.\n\n6. **Top 20 (10 women)**: Song is \"put your records on.\" Not relevant.\n\n7. **Top 16 (8 women)**: Song is \"breakaway.\" Nope.\n\n8. **Top 12**: Song is \"wild horses.\" Doesn't fit.\n\n9. **Top 11**: Song is \"big girls don't cry.\" No match.\n\n10. **Top 10**: Song is \"chain of fools.\" Not relevant.\n\n11. **Top 9**: Song is \"let it be.\" Doesn't match.\n\nSo, only one cell matches: row index 2 (since indexing starts at 0), and the columns are 'theme,' 'song choice,' and 'original artist.'

The claim says: \"For the Rolling Stones theme, Katie be number 6 in order.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see if there's a relevant row that matches this claim. Let me scan through each week to find where \"the rolling stones\" are mentioned as the theme.\n\nLooking at the table, the weeks are audition, hollywood, top 24, top 20, etc. Scanning further down, I see a row labeled \"top 12\" where the theme is \"the rolling stones.\" The song choice there is \"wild horses,\" and the original artist is also \"the rolling stones.\" The order for that week is 6.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"Katie\" in the context of being number 6. So I need to see if there's an entry where Katie is listed as the artist or participant with that order number. However, looking through the table provided, under the original artists column, I don't see any mention of \"Katie.\" The names listed are glenn miller, stevie wonder, alicia keys, adele, cy grant, corinne bailey rae, kelly clarkson, fergie, and the beatles.\n\nWait, that's interesting. None of these original artists are named Katie. So if the claim is saying that \"Katie\" was number 6 in order for the Rolling Stones theme, there's no evidence of that in the table. The order 6 is associated with \"the rolling stones,\" but not Katie specifically.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold because Katie isn't listed as an artist in that row or anywhere else in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"theme\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"order\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the song chosen for the Rolling Stone theme was originally performed by The Rolling Stones.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find all relevant entries. The table has columns like week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result.\n\nI'm focusing on the themes related to \"The Rolling Stones\" because the claim mentions that specific theme. Scanning through the table, I see a row with \"theme\" as \"lennonmccartney\" and another with \"the rolling stones.\"\n\nLooking at the first relevant row: the theme is \"lennonmccartney,\" but the song choice is \"let it be,\" performed by The Beatles. That doesn't match because The Rolling Stones aren't mentioned here.\n\nNext, the relevant row for \"the rolling stones\" as the theme: the song chosen is \"wild horses,\" and the original artist is also listed as The Rolling Stones. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo, since there's a row where both the theme and the original artist are The Rolling Stones (with their song \"wild horses\"), the claim is supported by this data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, I need to check if any row in the table matches both the theme and the original artist being The Rolling Stones.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:** Look for rows where the theme is \"the rolling stones.\"\n2. **Check song choice and artist:** For each such row, verify that the original artist is The Rolling Stones.\n3. **Determine if match exists:** In this case, one row matches both criteria.\n\n**Conclusion:** There's a matching row, so the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim first: \"big girl don't cry be the choice song where the original artist be stevie wonder.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying which columns and rows are relevant. The table has several columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. The claim mentions two specific things: the song title \"big girl don't cry\" and the original artist \"stevie wonder.\"\n\nFirst, I need to find the row where the song choice is \"big girl don't cry.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- Week 1: audition... no.\n- Week 2: hollywood... for once in my life... nope.\n- Week 3: hollywood... no one... not it.\n- Week 4: hollywood... chasing pavements... nope.\n- Week 5: top 24 (12 women)... feeling good... not it.\n- Week 6: top 20 (10 women)... put your records on... nope.\n- Week 7: top 16 (8 women)... breakaway... nope.\n- Week 8: top 12... wild horses... that's \"the rolling stones.\"\n- Week 9: top 11... big girls don't cry... yes, here it is. So the row index here is 9.\n\nNext, I check the original artist for this song in row 9. The column says \"fergie,\" not stevie wonder. That's a discrepancy. So the original artist isn't stevie wonder as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while \"big girl don't cry\" does appear as a song choice in the table, it's by fergie, not stevie wonder.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"9 be katie 's order number when the theme be the rolling stone.\" \n\nI need to break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **\"9 be Katie's order number\":** This suggests that the order number is 9.\n2. **\"when the theme be the rolling stone\":** This implies we're looking for a row where the theme is \"the rolling stones.\"\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided and analyze each relevant column to verify these points.\n\nThe columns in the table are:\n- week\n- theme\n- song choice\n- original artist\n- order\n- result\n\nI need to check the 'theme' column for any entry that matches \"the rolling stones\" (note: case sensitivity might matter, but the table seems consistent in title case). Also, I'll look at the 'order' column to see if there's an order number 9.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- The rows are:\n  - audition\n  - hollywood\n  - hollywood\n  - hollywood\n  - top 24 (12 women)\n  - top 20 (10 women)\n  - top 16 (8 women)\n  - top 12\n  - top 11\n  - top 10\n  - top 9\n\nWait, the last row is \"top 9,\" but looking at the 'theme' column:\n\n- Row 8: theme is \"the rolling stones\"\n\nSo that's a match for the second part of the claim. Now, checking the 'order' column for this row (row index 8). The order is 6. But the claim says it should be 9.\n\nHmm, so in the table, when the theme is \"the rolling stones,\" the order number is 6, not 9. This means the second part of the claim is FALSE because 6 \u2260 9.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the row indices and themes:\n\nRow 8: top 12 | theme: the rolling stones | order: 6\n\nSo yes, when theme is \"the rolling stones,\" the order is 6, not 9. Therefore, the claim that it's 9 is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other rows where the theme is \"the rolling stones.\" Scanning through, only row 8 has that theme. So no other rows apply here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the order number when the theme is \"the rolling stones\" is 6, not 9.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"order\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in markdown format, and the claim is: \"the rolling stone be the original artist of the chosen song when the theme be r&b / soul.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that whenever the theme is R&B/Soul, the original artist of the chosen song is The Rolling Stone. So, to verify this, I need to look for rows in the table where the \"theme\" column is \"r&b / soul\" and check if the corresponding \"original artist\" is The Rolling Stone.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nI see several rows. Let's go through each one:\n\n1. **Week: audition**, theme: auditioner's choice, song: last, original artist: Glenn Miller and his orchestra, order: n/a, result: advanced.\n   - Theme here is \"auditioner 's choice\", not R&B/Soul.\n\n2. **Hollywood**: \n   - First solo performance: theme is first solo performance, song is \"For Once in My Life\" by Stevie Wonder. So, the original artist is Stevie Wonder, not The Rolling Stone.\n   - Group performance: Alicia Keys. Again, different from The Rolling Stone.\n   - Second solo: Adele. Also not The Rolling Stone.\n\n3. **Top 24 (12 women)**:\n   - Theme: billboard hot 100 hits, song: \"Feeling Good\" by Cy Grant. Not R&B/Soul? Wait, Cy Grant is in R&B or soul? I think so, but the theme here is Billboard Hot 100 Hits, not specifically R&B/Soul. So maybe this row doesn't count for the claim.\n\n4. **Top 20 (10 women)**:\n   - Song: \"Put Your Records On\" by Corinne Bailey Rae. Again, R&B/soul artist, but the original artist is Corinne Bailey Rae, not The Rolling Stone.\n\n5. **Top 16 (8 women)**:\n   - Song: \"Breakaway\" by Kelly Clarkson. She's more in pop/rock, so not matching.\n\n6. **Top 12**:\n   - Theme: the rolling stones, song: \"Wild Horses\" by The Rolling Stones. So here, the original artist is The Rolling Stone, and theme is specifically \"the rolling stones\". Wait, but the claim refers to the theme being R&B/Soul. The Rolling Stones are more of a rock band, so their theme might not be R&B/Soul.\n\n7. **Top 11**:\n   - Theme: billboard 1 hits, song: \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" by Fergie. Not relevant.\n\n8. **Top 10**:\n   - Theme: r&b / soul, song: \"Chain of Fools\" by Aretha Franklin. So here, the theme is R&B/Soul, and the original artist is Aretha Franklin, not The Rolling Stone.\n\n9. **Top 9**:\n   - Song: \"Let It Be\" by The Beatles. Theme is Lennon-McCartney, which doesn't relate to R&B/Soul.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have missed that in the Top 12 row, the theme is \"the rolling stones,\" and the original artist is also The Rolling Stones. But does that fall under R&B/Soul? Probably not, since they're a rock band. So for the claim to be true, we need rows where theme is R&B/Soul and the original artist is The Rolling Stone.\n\nLooking again, in the Top 12 row, the theme is \"the rolling stones,\" which might not exactly match \"r&b / soul.\" Also, the song is \"Wild Horses\" by The Rolling Stones. So that's a possible match, but I'm not sure if \"the rolling stones\" counts as an R&B/Soul theme.\n\nIn the Top 10 row, the theme is r&b / soul, and the original artist is Aretha Franklin, who is in R&B/soul. But it's not The Rolling Stone, so that doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, another row: looking at the table again, maybe I missed something. Let me list all rows where the theme is \"r&b / soul.\" From the table:\n\n- **Top 10**: r&b / soul, artist: Aretha Franklin.\n- Any others? No, it seems like only Top 10 in this case.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, another row: top 24 (12 women): theme is billboard hot 100 hits. Similarly, top 20 (10 women) has the same theme, but song by Corinne Bailey Rae, who's R&B/soul, but her artist name isn't The Rolling Stone.\n\nSo in the table, there are only a few rows where the theme is explicitly r&b / soul. Looking:\n\n- **Top 10**: theme r&b/soul, song \"Chain of Fools\" by Aretha Franklin.\n- **Top 12**: theme is the rolling stones, which may not be r&b/soul.\n\nSo in the table, only Top 10 has a theme of r&b/soul. But that row's original artist is Aretha Franklin, not The Rolling Stone.\n\nTherefore, there are no rows where the theme is R&B/Soul and the original artist is The Rolling Stone. So the claim would be FALSE because it's claiming that whenever the theme is R&B/Soul, the original artist is The Rolling Stone, but in reality, when the theme is R&B/Soul (like Top 10), the original artist is someone else.\n\nWait, but wait another moment: looking at the top 12 row again. The theme is \"the rolling stones,\" which might be a specific theme related to that week. The song is by The Rolling Stones, so maybe that's relevant. But the claim specifies when the theme is R&B/Soul, not specifically when it's about The Rolling Stones.\n\nSo, in summary, there are no rows where both the theme is R&B/Soul and the original artist is The Rolling Stone. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that whenever the theme is R&B/Soul, the original artist of the chosen song is The Rolling Stone. By examining each row, we find that only one row has an R&B/Soul theme (Top 10), and in that case, the original artist is Aretha Franklin, not The Rolling Stone. Therefore, there's no evidence supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"theme\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"original artist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
