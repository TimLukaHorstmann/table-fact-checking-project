    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"series 32 originally aired on December 21, 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. It has several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, and prod code. Each row represents a different episode with its corresponding details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"series 32.\" In the context of TV shows or seasons, \"series\" often refers to an individual episode within a season. The table has two columns related to numbering: \"no in series\" and \"no in season.\" From the table, it seems that \"no in series\" is a running number for each episode across all seasons, while \"no in season\" likely denotes the episode's position within a specific season.\n\nLooking at the data, I see that the no in series column goes up to 43, and each entry corresponds to an episode with its own details. For example, series 23 is titled \"back to school,\" directed by Andy Cadiff, written by Rob Lazebnik & Rob Lotterstein, and aired on September 10, 2006.\n\nNow, the claim specifically refers to series 32. I need to find the corresponding row in the table for series 32. Scanning through the no in series column, I see that series 32 is indeed present at row index 9 (since it starts counting from 23, so each row increments by 1). At row index 9, the details are:\n\n- no in series: 32\n- no in season: 10\n- title: love is blind\n- directed by: Andy Cadiff\n- written by: Earl Davis\n- original air date: December 21, 2006\n- prod code: 3t5610\n\nSo, the original air date for series 32 is December 21, 2006. The claim states that this is correct. Therefore, the claim aligns with the information provided in the table.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant columns to confirm further. The \"prod code\" is a unique identifier per episode; in this case, it's 3t5610 for series 32. Since the claim doesn't mention the prod code, maybe I don't need that unless I suspect a discrepancy, but here it seems consistent.\n\nAdditionally, the \"no in season\" is 10, which indicates it was the 10th episode of that particular season. The claim doesn't specify the season, so I think that's not necessary for this verification.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, series 32 did indeed air on December 21, 2006. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"series 32 originally aired on December 21, 2006,\" we need to check the relevant columns in the provided table. The key column here is \"original air date.\" By locating series 32's row (row index 9), we find that the original air date matches December 21, 2006.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking against the given table. The claim is: \"a bitter pill to swallow directed by andy cadiff, originally aired on november 19, 2006.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to see what each part needs to verify.\n\n1. **Title**: The show is called \"a bitter pill to swallow.\" Looking at the table, I need to find a row where the title matches this exactly. \n\n2. **Director**: The claim says it's directed by andy cadiff. So, I should look for rows where the director's name is andy cadiff.\n\n3. **Original Air Date**: The claim mentions november 19, 2006 as the original air date. I need to find a row with this date in the \"original air date\" column.\n\nNow, going through each row:\n\n- Row 35 has title \"it 's not easy being green.\" Not matching.\n- Next, looking for the exact title \"a bitter pill to swallow.\" Scanning the rows, I see that it's not listed in the table provided. Wait, the table goes up to row 43 with titles like \"a bitter pill to swallow\" at row 35? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking back: The titles are:\n\nRow 23: back to school\n\n...\n\nRow 34: put on a happy face\n\nRow 35: it 's not easy being green\n\n...\n\nRow 43: a bitter pill to swallow\n\nAh, yes, row 43 has the title \"a bitter pill to swallow.\" So that's the relevant row for the title.\n\nNow, checking the director for row 43. The director is andy cadiff, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, check the original air date for row 43. According to the table, it was originally aired on April 1, 2007. But the claim says november 19, 2006. That doesn't match. \n\nSo, even though the title and director match, the original air date does not. Therefore, the claim is false because the dates don't align.\n\nWait, but wait: Looking at row 43, it's April 1, 2007. So that's different from november 19, 2006. Therefore, the claim's date is incorrect, making the entire statement false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes a mismatched original air date for \"a bitter pill to swallow.\" While the title and director match, the air date in the table doesn't.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
