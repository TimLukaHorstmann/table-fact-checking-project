    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim about the Toronto Blue Jays playing in an 8-game series with attendance greater than 5000 in May 1991 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a specific series: 8 games, against an opponent, with attendance over 5000 fans during May of the 1991 season. So I should look for any rows where the Blue Jays played a game that month and check both the number of games they played in that series and the attendance.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list various opponents, dates, scores, loss details, attendance, and the team's record. The opponents listed are rangers, royals, white sox, athletics, and angels. I don't see any mention of Toronto Blue Jays as the home team here. Wait, actually, looking closer, perhaps the table is about another team? Because it lists opponents like rangers, royals, etc., which are other MLB teams, but not Blue Jays.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check each row's \"opponent\" column. The opponents are Rangers, Royals, White Sox, Athletics, Angels. None of them are Blue Jays. So perhaps the table is about these teams' games in May 1991. That would mean that the Blue Jays aren't even playing here; it's other teams' schedules.\n\nBut then, how can there be a claim about Blue Jays if they're not in this table? Unless I'm misunderstanding the purpose of the table. Maybe the table is supposed to include all games in May 1991 across MLB, but only showing some opponents.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake and the table isn't about the Blue Jays at all. But the claim is specifically about the Blue Jays. So if they're not present in the table, then the claim can't be supported by this data. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE because there's no relevant information about the Blue Jays' games in May 1991 here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me double-check each row to see if any of them are about the Blue Jays. Looking through the opponents: rangers, royals, white sox, athletics, angels\u2014no Blue Jays listed. So unless one of these teams is playing against the Blue Jays, which isn't indicated, the claim can't be supported.\n\nTherefore, there's no data in the table that relates to the Blue Jays playing an 8-game series with attendance over 5000. The relevant cells would need to show Blue Jays' games, but since they're not present, it's impossible to verify the claim based on this information.\n</think>\n\nThe table provided lists opponents such as rangers, royals, white sox, athletics, and angels, but does not mention Toronto Blue Jays. Since the claim specifically refers to the Blue Jays, there is no relevant data in the table to support or refute it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the Toronto Blue Jays win 2 of the last 3 games they play in May 1991\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the Blue Jays winning two out of their last three games in May 1991. So, I need to find the relevant information in the table that pertains to the Blue Jays and their game outcomes around May 31st or so, since \"last\" typically refers to towards the end of the month.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, opponent, score, loss details, attendance, and record. The dates go up to May 31. I need to identify if there are three consecutive games near the end of May where the Blue Jays won two and lost one.\n\nWait, but in the table, the opponents are listed as \"rangers\", \"royals\", \"white sox\", \"athletics\", and \"angels\". There's no mention of Toronto Blue Jays here. That might be a problem because if the table doesn't include their games, then there's nothing to check.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the table is from 1991, or includes May 1991? Wait, the dates are in May, but the year isn't specified beyond \"may\". If this is May 1991 for the Blue Jays, but in the table, they might be playing other teams in a different context.\n\nWait, the table seems to list opponents as Texas Rangers, Royals, White Sox, Athletics, and Angels. So unless the Blue Jays are playing these teams in May 1991, their games aren't shown here. Therefore, if the claim is about the Blue Jays winning two of their last three games in May 1991, but the table doesn't include those games, then there's no data to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the dates: may 1 to may 31. The opponents are other teams, not Blue Jays. So none of the games listed are against the Blue Jays. That means if the claim is about the Blue Jays winning two of their last three games in May 1991, the table doesn't provide any relevant information because those games aren't included.\n\nTherefore, there's no data to confirm or deny the claim based on this table. So the answer should be FALSE because the necessary information isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not include any Blue Jays games, so it cannot verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the toronto blue jay play the ranger 3 time in may during the 1991 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions three things:\n1. The team being played against: Toronto Blue Jay.\n2. The opponent referred to as \"the ranger,\" which might be a typo. In the table, I see opponents like 'rangers' and 'royals,' but not 'Blue Jay.' Wait, actually, the table has opponents such as rangers, royals, white sox, etc., but not Blue Jays. Hmm, that's odd because the claim mentions \"the ranger,\" which might imply a specific team, possibly the Texas Rangers.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, I see entries against 'rangers' on May 1 and May 7, 9, etc. So in the table, when the opponent is rangers, they are playing against that team. Now, the Blue Jays aren't directly mentioned in the opponents column, but maybe one of the teams in the table is the Texas Rangers, so if a game was played against them three times in May during 1991, it would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if \"the toronto blue jay\" is playing \"the ranger.\" Wait, no, the opponent is referred to as 'ranger,' but in the table, it's either rangers or another team. So perhaps the claim is saying that Blue Jays played against Texas Rangers three times in May 1991.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I don't see any entries where the opponent is \"Blue Jay\" or \"Rangers.\" Wait, no\u2014the table has opponents like rangers, royals, white sox, etc. So if the claim is that Blue Jays played against Texas Rangers three times in May 1991, we need to check for games involving both teams.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row has a date, opponent, score, loss details, attendance, and record. The opponents listed are rangers, royals, white sox, etc. So perhaps \"the ranger\" refers to Texas Rangers, but in the table, it's spelled as 'rangers.' Let me check the table.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- May 1: opponent is rangers.\n- May 2: royals.\nSo on and so forth.\n\nNow, I need to see if Blue Jays played against Texas Rangers three times in May 1991. But looking through the table, all opponents are either rangers, royals, white sox, angels, or athletics. There's no mention of Blue Jays or Texas Rangers as an opponent except for 'rangers' and possibly others.\n\nWait, maybe \"the toronto blue jay\" is a typo, and it should be another team? Or perhaps the claim is incorrect because in the table, there are no games where both teams are Texas Rangers and Blue Jays. Wait, but the opponents listed are either rangers or other teams, so if the Blue Jays played against rangers three times in May 1991, then those would be the relevant cells.\n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see any game where both teams are named 'ranger' as the opponent and Blue Jay. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is that Blue Jays played Rangers three times, which would mean three games where their opponents were Rangers.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- May 1: rangers\n- May 7: rangers\n- May 9: white sox\nWait, May 1 is against rangers, and May 7 is also against rangers. That's two games already. Are there three? Let me check further.\n\nLooking down the table:\nMay 31: angels\n\nSo May 1 (rangers), May 7 (rangers), and maybe another date. Wait, May 9 is against white sox, not rangers. So only two games against rangers in May. Therefore, the claim that they played three times might be incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all the dates where opponent is rangers:\n\nLooking at each row's opponent column:\n- Row 0: rangers\n- Row 1: royals\n- Row 2: royals\n- Row 3: white sox\n- Row 4: white sox\n- Row 5: angels\n- Row 6: angels\n- And so on, up to row 30, which is against angels.\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. May 1: rangers\n2. May 2: royals\n3. May 3: royals\n4. May 4: white sox\n5. May 5: white sox\n6. May 6: angels\n7. May 7: rangers\n8. May 8: angels\n9. May 9: white sox\n10. May 10: white sox\n11. May 11: angels\n12. May 12: rangers? Wait, no, looking at the table provided by the user, I think it's better to check each row.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the dates where opponent is rangers:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: date May 1, opponent rangers\nRow 7: date May 7, opponent rangers? Wait, in the initial table provided by the user, let me count properly.\n\nWait, actually, the user's table starts with May 1 as the first row, and goes up to May 31. Let me list out each row:\n\n1. May 1: opponent rangers\n2. May 2: royals\n3. May 3: royals\n4. May 4: white sox\n5. May 5: white sox\n6. May 6: angels\n7. May 7: rangers\n8. May 8: angels\n9. May 9: white sox\n10. May 10: white sox\n11. May 11: angels\n12. May 12: ?\nWait, perhaps the user's table is as provided, and I need to check each row for opponent being rangers.\n\nLooking at the given table:\n\nThe opponents are:\n\nRow 0: rangers\n\nRow 1: royals\n\nRow 2: royals\n\nRow 3: white sox\n\nRow 4: white sox\n\nRow 5: angels\n\nRow 6: rangers (May 7)\n\nRow 7: angels\n\nRow 8: white sox\n\nRow 9: white sox\n\nRow 10: angels\n\nRow 11: ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the rows where opponent is rangers:\n\n- May 1: rangers\n- May 7: rangers\nThat's two games. Therefore, the Blue Jays played against rangers twice in May.\n\nBut the claim says three times. So that would make the claim FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, the opponent in the table is 'rangers,' not 'the ranger' as in the claim. The term \"the ranger\" might be a misnomer or specific to a team, but in the table, it's spelled as 'rangers.' So perhaps the relevant cells are rows 0 and 6 (May 1 and May 7).\n\nWait, but the opponent is 'rangers,' which could be Texas Rangers. The claim says \"the toronto blue jay play the ranger 3 time in may during the 1991 season.\" So it's about Blue Jays playing against Rangers three times in May 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, if Blue Jays played against Texas Rangers (opponent: rangers) three times, then the relevant cells would be those rows where opponent is rangers. But from the table provided, only two games are against rangers in May.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they only played twice, not three times.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that Blue Jays are indeed playing against Texas Rangers in these games. The opponents in the table are either rangers, royals, etc., so if rangers correspond to Texas Rangers, then yes. Therefore, the two games would be May 1 and May 7.\n\nHence, the claim is incorrect because it states three times, but only two games are present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Toronto Blue Jays played \"the ranger\" (Texas Rangers) three times in May 1991 is FALSE. According to the provided data, the Blue Jays faced the Texas Rangers (opposed as \"rangers\") on May 1 and May 7, which accounts for only two games. Therefore, they did not play three times during that month.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false. The Toronto Blue Jays played the Texas Rangers twice in May 1991, not three times.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says: \"the game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jay season was played against the Royal.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in May (since it's about May games) and find out which game had the lowest attendance. To do this, I'll go through each row from may 1 to may 31 and note down the attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' column:\n\n- May 1: 33439\n- May 2: 22896\n- May 3: 20809\n- May 4: 22628\n- May 5: 22588\n- May 7: 44622\n- May 8: 43211\n- May 9: 47236\n- May 10: 50198\n- May 11: 50206\n- May 12: 50108\n- May 13: 44275\n- May 14: 43357\n- May 15: 50113\n- May 17: 30095\n- May 18: 34861\n- May 19: 41015\n- May 20: 24631\n- May 21: 22738\n- May 24: 26408\n- May 25: 36732\n- May 26: 45307\n- May 28: 50299\n- May 29: 50262\n- May 30: 50271\n- May 31: 50252\n\nNow, I need to identify the lowest attendance. Let me list them in order:\n\nLooking at the numbers, the smallest ones are May 21 with 22738 and May 20 with 24631. Comparing these two, 22738 is lower than 24631. So May 21 has the lowest attendance.\n\nNow, I need to check what the opponent was for that game on May 21. Looking at the 'opponent' column for May 21: it's \"athletics\". The claim says it was against the Royal, but the actual opponent was Athletics, not Royal. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me double-check. May 21 is against Athletics, so the game with the lowest attendance was played against Athletics, not the Royal. That means the claim's assertion about the opponent is wrong.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to check would be the row for May 21 and the columns 'date' and 'opponent'. The row index for May 21 is... let me count. Starting from may 1 as row 0? Wait, no, looking at the table's markdown, each row corresponds to a specific date in May.\n\nWait, the table starts with may 1 as the first row, so row_index 0 is May 1, row 1 is May 2, and so on. So May 21 would be row index 20 because it's the 21st day (since row 0 is May 1). Wait no: May 1 is row 0, May 2 is row 1,... May 21 would be row 20.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\n- May 1: 0\n- May 2:1\n- ...\n- May 21:20\n\nYes, so May 21 is row_index 20. The columns are 'date', 'opponent', etc. So to verify the claim, I need to look at row 20's opponent and date.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about the game with the lowest attendance being against Royal. Since the game on May 21 was against Athletics, not Royal, that makes the claim false. Therefore, the relevant cell is the 'opponent' column for May 21 (row_index 20) and perhaps the date to confirm it's May 21.\n\nSo in terms of JSON structure, I need to list the cells that are relevant to verify this. The cells needed would be the row index and the column name where the data is stored that confirms whether the opponent was Royal or not.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include:\n\n- Row 20 (May 21) for 'opponent' because that's where we check who the game was against.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game with the lowest attendance in May was played against the Royal.

The claim says: \"the toronto blue jays lose 3 consecutive game between the 25th and the 28 may 1991.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's talking about three consecutive losses by the Blue Jays during May 25 to May 28, specifically in 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to see if there are any games played by the Blue Jays (opponents listed as \"angels\" and \"white sox\") around that timeframe where they lost three in a row. Wait, actually, in the table, the opponents include rangers, royals, white sox, angels, and athletics. Since the claim mentions Blue Jays, I need to see if any of these are referred to as the Blue Jays. Hmm, perhaps in the table, the Blue Jays might be listed under a different opponent name or maybe the table doesn't list them directly? Wait, looking at the table, the opponents are \"rangers,\" \"royals,\" \"white sox,\" \"angels,\" and \"athletics.\" There's no mention of Blue Jays here. So perhaps the claim refers to the Blue Jays losing three consecutive games, but in this table, they might be listed under a different name.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table seems to show various teams; perhaps the Blue Jays are not included here because they weren't playing against themselves? Or maybe their opponents were other teams. So I need to check if there's any data about the Blue Jays losing three in a row around May 25-28.\n\nBut looking through the table, I don't see any mention of the Blue Jays as an opponent. The closest are \"white sox,\" \"angels,\" and others. Maybe the table is about another team, like the Twins or something else, but no, it's about various opponents.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is about a specific team, and the Blue Jays are their opponents in some games. So I need to check if between May 25 and May 28, the team listed lost three consecutive games against the Blue Jays.\n\nLooking at the dates in the table: from May 1 to May 31. Let's focus on May 25 to May 28.\n\nOn May 25, the team played the angels, score was 5 - 0, and they lost (stottlemyre). Wait, so if this is the team whose data we're looking at, then they lost that game.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. The claim is about Blue Jays losing three consecutive games in May 25-28, 1991. But in the table, on May 25, it's the team vs angels, so perhaps if this team is the Blue Jays, then the data would be relevant. Alternatively, if the Blue Jays are the opponents, their game results would matter.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify: The claim says Blue Jays lost three consecutive games between May 25-28. So in that period, they must have lost three times in a row.\n\nLooking at the table, let's check if any team lost three consecutive games during May 25-28.\n\nFirst, on May 25, it's against angels, and the team won (5 - 0). Then May 26: 6 - 2 loss. So if this is the Blue Jays losing, but wait, May 26, opponent is angels; if the claim is about Blue Jays losing, then perhaps they lost that game.\n\nWait, no, the table shows for each date who the home team was or something? Or maybe it's just the matchups without designating which is home or away. So I need to check if between May 25-28, the Blue Jays lost three consecutive games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes the Blue Jays as opponents, so let me look through all dates around May 25-28.\n\nLooking at May 25: angels vs some team, result was a loss (5 - 0). So maybe that's not relevant unless it's the Blue Jays losing. But I don't know who the opponent is.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't include the Blue Jays, so their games are not listed here. That would mean the claim is not supported by this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the team in the table is the Blue Jays, and they lost three consecutive games against another team between May 25-28.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nMay 25: team vs angels, lost? No, it was a win (5 - 0).\nMay 26: team vs angels, score 6 - 2. Wait, but in the table, May 26 is an entry where the team played against someone and scored 8 - 6, which was a loss. Wait no, May 30 is 8-6. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 24: May 25, opponent angels, score 5 - 0 (team won)\nRow 25: May 26, opponent angels, score 6 - 2? Wait no, looking again: May 26 is not in the table. Let me check the rows.\n\nWait, the table starts at row 0 as May 1, up to May 31. So:\n\nMay 25: index 24 (row 24), opponent angels, score 5-0 (win)\nMay 26: index 25, opponent not sure? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, the table is a list of games from May 1 to May 31. Let's list them out:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: May 1 vs rangers (team lost)\n...\nContinuing, but maybe it's better to focus on May 25-28.\n\nMay 25: opponent angels, team won (5-0). So not a loss.\nMay 26: opponent angels, score 6 - 2. Wait, no, looking at the data:\n\nWait, row 24 is May 25: \"angels\" opponent, 5-0, so win.\n\nRow 25: May 26? Let me check: May 26 would be index 25. Looking at the table, the entries are:\n\nAfter May 21 (index 21), May 22: index 22, opponent rangers, result not shown but perhaps a loss or win.\n\nWait, I think this approach is getting too confusing. Maybe instead, focus on the claim's timeframe: May 25-28.\n\nLooking for three consecutive losses by Blue Jays in that period.\n\nIn the table, between May 25 and May 28:\n\nMay 25: team lost? No, they won.\nMay 26: Looking at the table, May 26 is not explicitly shown. Wait, perhaps I need to count correctly.\n\nWait, the table has entries for each day from May 1 (index 0) to May 31 (index 30). So May 25 is index 24, May 26 is 25, May 27 is 26, May 28 is 27.\n\nLooking at May 25: opponent angels, team won (5-0).\nMay 26: Let's check what happened. Wait, row 25 would be May 26. Looking at the table data:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out the relevant rows for May 25 to May 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for any three consecutive losses in that timeframe by the same team (assuming Blue Jays are the team losing).\n\nBut without knowing which team is the Blue Jays, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the table includes the Blue Jays as an opponent, so their games would be relevant.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the Blue Jays losing, so perhaps I need to check if they lost three in a row during that period.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nMay 25: Blue Jays lost? If they played on May 25, and it's a loss, then...\n\nBut without knowing which team is playing whom each day, it's difficult. Alternatively, maybe the claim refers to a specific series or event where the Blue Jays lost three in a row, and I need to see if that aligns with the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently: The claim says between May 25 and May 28, Blue Jays lost three consecutive games. So from May 25 to May 27, inclusive, they lost each day. So I need to check those dates for a loss by the Blue Jays.\n\nLooking at May 25: If it's a loss, that would be one.\nMay 26: another loss.\nMay 27: third loss.\n\nBut without knowing who is playing whom, it's hard to tell if it's the Blue Jays losing. Alternatively, perhaps the team in the table lost on May 25, 26, and 27, making three losses.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 24 (May 25): opponent angels, score 5-0 (so team won, not a loss).\nRow 25: May 26, opponent not clear. Wait, looking at the table entries:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all rows from May 25 to May 28.\n\nBut this is taking too long. Maybe it's better to accept that without more info, it's unlikely the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether the Blue Jays lost three consecutive games between May 25 and May 28 based on the provided table of game outcomes. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Dates**: The timeframe is May 25, 26, 27, and 28 (inclusive).\n2. **Examine Each Date**:\n   - **May 25**: The Blue Jays won against the Angels (5-0), so no loss.\n   - **May 26**: No direct evidence from the table; further clarification is needed.\n   - **May 27**: There's no specific entry for this date in the provided data.\n   - **May 28**: Similarly, no entry exists, making it impossible to confirm a loss.\n\nWithout clear entries for May 26, 27, and 28, the claim cannot be definitively supported. \n\n**Answer**: The Blue Jays did not lose three consecutive games between May 25 and May 28 according to the provided data.",

The claim is: \"the toronto blue jays lose 2 of the last 3 game they play in may 1991.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The Toronto Blue Jays are a team, and the claim is about their performance in May 1991, specifically that they lost two out of their last three games.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with dates, opponents, scores, loss details, attendance, and record. But I notice something odd: all the dates range from May 1 to May 31, but there are no entries for May 1991. The years mentioned in the table go up to 1991 because May 31 is the last date shown. Wait, actually, looking again, all the games listed are in May 1991? No, wait, the table seems to list multiple months and years beyond 1991. But that can't be right for a baseball season.\n\nWait, no, actually, it's possible that the table is from a specific source, but perhaps it's not accurate because May only has 31 days, so May 31 is the last date here, which would imply all these games are in May 1991. But that seems like too many games for one month\u201431 days, so maybe some games are on the same day, which isn't realistic. So perhaps this table is incorrect or from a fictional context.\n\nBut regardless, the claim refers to May 1991. The relevant part is whether the Blue Jays lost two of their last three games in that month. So I need to look at the last three games they played in May 1991 and see if they lost two.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, opponent, score, etc. But the opponents listed are rangers, royals, white sox, athletics, angels. There's no mention of Blue Jays or Toronto anywhere. That's odd because the claim is about the Blue Jays. So maybe this table doesn't include their games.\n\nSo if the Blue Jays' games aren't in the table, then it's impossible to verify whether they lost two out of three games. Therefore, there's no data to support the claim. Hence, the answer would be FALSE because we can't confirm it based on the given information.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Perhaps \"last 3 game\" refers not to May 1991 but another context, but the table doesn't cover that period. Alternatively, perhaps this table is a misrepresentation or from a different context where Blue Jays are involved. However, without their games in the table, we can't check.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the Toronto Blue Jays losing two of their last three games in May 1991 cannot be verified because their games aren't listed in the table provided. Therefore, there's no data to support or refute the claim.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about the Toronto Blue Jays playing in 8 games with attendance lower than 5000 in May of the 1991 season is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim. It says that the Blue Jays played 8 games in May 1991 where their attendance was below 5,000. To verify this, I need to check the table for any entries related to the Blue Jays during May 1991 and see if there are exactly 8 games with attendance less than 5,000.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a game played on a specific date in May against a particular opponent. The columns include details like score, loss (pitcher and score), attendance, and record. I'm particularly interested in the 'opponent' column for the Blue Jays because the claim is about their games.\n\nScanning through the table, I notice that most of the opponents are \"white sox\", \"royals\", \"rangers\", \"athletics\", and \"angels\". There's no mention of the Toronto Blue Jays as an opponent in this table. This makes me wonder: does the table only include games for one team or multiple teams? The headers don't specify, but given that all entries are under 'opponent', it seems like each row represents a game for whichever team is playing against whom.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the claim mentions the Blue Jays as the team in question. If they aren't listed as opponents here, maybe this table isn't capturing their games. Alternatively, perhaps the table does include them but I'm missing it. Let me go through each row again to ensure I haven't overlooked any Blue Jays entries.\n\nGoing row by row:\n\n- May 1: Opponent is rangers\n- May 2: royals\n- May 3: royals\n- May 4: royals\n- May 5: royals\n- May 7: rangers\n- May 8: rangers\n- May 9: white sox\n- May 10: white sox\n- May 11: white sox\n- May 12: white sox\n- May 13: royals\n- May 14: royals\n- May 15: royals\n- May 17: white sox\n- May 18: white sox\n- May 19: white sox\n- May 20: athletics\n- May 21: athletics\n- May 22: athletics\n- May 24: angels\n- May 25: angels\n- May 26: angels\n- May 28: athletics\n- May 29: athletics\n- May 30: athletics\n- May 31: angels\n\nI don't see any row where the opponent is the Blue Jays. Therefore, if this table doesn't include their games, there's no way to verify whether they played 8 games with low attendance in May 1991.\n\nBut wait, maybe the Blue Jays are the home team in some of these games. However, looking at the 'opponent' column, none of them are Blue Jays. So perhaps this table doesn't cover their season, or it's incomplete.\n\nIf I consider that the Blue Jays aren't present as opponents in this table, then the claim can't be verified because there's no data on their games during May 1991. Without their game details, we can't check attendance figures for their specific matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is from a different source and doesn't include all their games, or it's structured differently. But based on what's provided, I don't see any Blue Jays games.\n\nTherefore, since there's no relevant data in the table about the Blue Jays playing 8 games with attendance under 5,000 in May 1991, the claim can't be supported. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because the Blue Jays aren't listed as opponents in the provided table, and thus no relevant data exists to check their attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"the Toronto Blue Jay play the Angel 3 times in May during the 1991 season.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. They mention three games between the Blue Jays and the Angels in May 1991. So I need to check if there are any matches in the table where both teams are these, specifically looking for Toronto Blue Jay (probably referred to as Blue Jays) against the Angels, and happening in May 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, opponent, score, loss details, attendance, and record. I'll need to go through each row to find relevant matches.\n\nStarting from May 1 onwards:\n\n- May 1: Opponent is Rangers.\n- May 2: Royals.\n- May 3: Royals again.\n- May 4: Royals.\n- May 5: Royals.\n- May 7: Rangers.\n- May 8: Rangers.\n- May 9: White Sox.\n- May 10: White Sox.\n- May 11: White Sox.\n- May 12: White Sox.\n- May 13: Royals.\n- May 14: Royals.\n- May 15: Royals.\n- May 17: White Sox.\n- May 18: White Sox.\n- May 19: White Sox.\n- May 20: Athletics.\n- May 21: Athletics.\n- May 22: Athletics.\n- May 24: Angels.\n- May 25: Angels.\n- May 26: Angels.\n- May 28: Athletics.\n- May 29: Athletics.\n- May 30: Athletics.\n- May 31: Angels.\n\nNow, focusing on the dates in May. The claim is about three games in May 1991. So I need to see if there are exactly three matches between Blue Jays and Angels in May of that year.\n\nLooking at the table, the only opponents labeled as \"Angels\" are from May 24, 25, 26, and 31. That's four dates. Wait, but let me check each one:\n\n- May 24: Opponent is Angels.\n- May 25: Opponent is Angels.\n- May 26: Opponent is Angels.\n- May 31: Opponent is Angels.\n\nSo that's four games against the Angels in May. The claim says three times, so there seems to be a discrepancy here. However, perhaps I made a mistake because sometimes teams might not be referred to by their full names.\n\nWait, the table lists opponents as \"rangers\", \"royals\", etc., but for example, May 9 is against \"white sox\" which probably stands for White Sox. Similarly, looking at the opponents, maybe \"angels\" is a shorthand for Angels.\n\nSo if that's the case, then in May, there are four games against the Angels: May 24,25,26,31. So more than three. The claim says exactly three times, so this would make it FALSE because there are four, not three.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread something else. Let me double-check if any of these opponents are actually the Blue Jays. Looking at the table, the opponents listed are Rangers, Royals, White Sox, Athletics, and Angels. There's no mention of Blue Jays in the opponent column. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"Toronto Blue Jay\" as playing against the Angel. So I need to check if any row has the opponent as Blue Jays. From the table provided, it seems that the opponents are other teams like White Sox, etc., but none of them mention Blue Jays. That suggests there might be a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete or uses abbreviations. Maybe \"Blue Jay\" is referred to as another team name. But given the information, I don't see any row where the opponent is the Blue Jays or Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to both teams as playing each other: Blue Jays vs Angels. So in the table, I'm looking for rows where the home team is Blue Jays and the opponent is Angels. But from what's given, the opponents are other teams like White Sox, etc., with no mention of Blue Jays.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the columns. Let me check again. The table has a column called \"Opponent,\" so each row shows who they played against. So if any of these rows have \"Blue Jays\" as either home or away, that would be relevant.\n\nLooking through each opponent:\n\n- May 1: Rangers\n- May 2: Royals\n- May 3: Royals\n- May 4: Royals\n- May 5: Royals\n- May 7: Rangers\n- May 8: Rangers\n- May 9: White Sox\n- May 10: White Sox\n- May 11: White Sox\n- May 12: White Sox\n- May 13: Royals\n- May 14: Royals\n- May 15: Royals\n- May 17: White Sox\n- May 18: White Sox\n- May 19: White Sox\n- May 20: Athletics\n- May 21: Athletics\n- May 22: Athletics\n- May 24: Angels\n- May 25: Angels\n- May 26: Angels\n- May 28: Athletics\n- May 29: Athletics\n- May 30: Athletics\n- May 31: Angels\n\nSo no, none of the opponents are Blue Jays. Therefore, according to this table, there are zero games between Blue Jays and Angels in May 1991.\n\nBut wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought where I saw four games against the Angels. So perhaps the claim is FALSE because either there aren't three games (there are four) or because Blue Jays didn't play them at all (since they're not listed).\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the Toronto Blue Jay play the Angel 3 time in May during the 1991 season.\" So it's about Blue Jays vs Angels. Since the table doesn't show any games against Blue Jays by anyone else, or vice versa, then there are zero such games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Blue Jays didn't play the Angels three times in May 1991 as per the table.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting information. The user's table shows four games between White Sox and someone (maybe not Blue Jays). So perhaps it's possible that there were four games between White Sox and another team, but no games between Blue Jays and Angels.\n\nSo based on the table, Blue Jays didn't play against the Angels in May 1991 at all. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are none because Blue Jays did not play the Angels three times in May 1991 according to the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The columns are date, opponent, score, loss (which seems to show the losing pitcher's name and their stats), attendance, and record.\n\nThe key here is to find the game with the lowest attendance in May 1991 for the Blue Jays. So I'll need to look at all the games in May and compare their attendances.\n\nLooking at the table, the dates range from May 1 to May 31. Each row has a date, opponent, score, loss details, attendance, and record.\n\nI think the first step is to go through each game in May and note down the attendance figures.

May 3 vs Royals - 20,809\n4. May 4 vs Royals - 22,628\n5. May 5 vs Royals - 22,588\n6. May 7 vs Rangers - 44,622\n7. May 8 vs Rangers - 43,211\n8. May 9 vs White Sox - 47,236\n9.

May 30 vs Athletics - 50,271\n27. May 31 vs Angels - 50,252\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest attendance among these numbers.\n\nLooking at each number:\n\n- 24,631 (May 20 vs Athletics)\n- 22,738 (May 21 vs Athletics)\n- 34,028 (May 22 vs Athletics)\n- 43,357 (May 14 vs Royals)\n- 44,275 (May 13 vs Royals)\n- 50,108 (May 12 vs White Sox)\n- 50,198 (May 10 vs White Sox)\n- 50,206 (May 11 vs White Sox)\n- 30,095 (May 17 vs White Sox)\n- 34,861 (May 18 vs White Sox)\n- 41,015 (May 19 vs White Sox)\n- 26,408 (May 24 vs Angels)\n- 36,732 (May 25 vs Angels)\n- 45,307 (May 26 vs Angels)\n- 50,299 (May 28 vs Athletics)\n- 50,262 (May 29 vs Athletics)\n- 50,271 (May 30 vs Athletics)\n- 50,252 (May 31 vs Angels)\n\nThe smallest attendance is on May 21 against the Athletics with 22,738.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this game was indeed in May and part of the Blue Jays' schedule. Since all dates are in May, that seems correct.\n\nNow, checking if this game was against the Athletics: yes, May 21 vs Athletics.\n\nSo, according to the table, the game with the lowest attendance in May had the Athletics as the opponent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the lowest attendance game was against the Athletics.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones for May 21 and the opponent column. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the toronto blue jays lose 1 consecutive game between the 25th and the 28 may 1991.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see if there are any games involving the Blue Jays around that time period.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it lists opponents, dates, scores, loss details, attendance, and record. The dates go up to May 31, but I need to focus on May 25th to May 28th.\n\nI should check if there are any games for the Blue Jays during those days. From the table:\n\n- May 24: Opponent is angels\n- May 25: Opponent is angels\n- May 26: Opponent is angels\n- May 27: Not listed, but the next game is May 28 against athletics.\n\nWait, May 28th is a game against athletics. So, between May 25 and May 28, there are games on the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 28th.\n\nBut the claim refers to consecutive losses between May 25 and May 28. So I need to check if the Blue Jays lost any consecutive games in that range.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- May 24: Opponent is angels; score is 3 - 2 (Blue Jays win), loss by finley\n- May 25: Opponent is angels; score is 5 - 0 (Blue Jays win)\n- May 26: Opponent is angels; score is 6 - 2 (Blue Jays win)\n\nNone of these are losses for the Blue Jays. Then, May 28th is a game against athletics where the Blue Jays lost 8 - 6. But that's only one loss.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014May 27 isn't listed in the table provided. So if there was a game on May 27 that the Blue Jays lost, that could make two consecutive losses between May 25 and May 28. However, since May 27 is not present in the table, I can assume there wasn't a game that day or it's not included.\n\nSo the only loss in that period is on May 28 against the athletics, making it just one loss. There are no consecutive losses between May 25 and May 28 because the Blue Jays didn't lose any games from May 25 to May 26; they won both. Therefore, there isn't a period of two consecutive losses between those dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to losing one game, not necessarily consecutive. But the term \"consecutive\" implies multiple in a row. So since there's only one loss during that stretch, the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe Blue Jays did not lose any consecutive games between May 25 and May 28.
