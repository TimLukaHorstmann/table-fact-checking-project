Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe claim is: \"76059 attend when the result be l 20 - 17.\" Hmm, breaking that down, it seems like someone is saying that there was an attendance number of 76,059 where the game's result was a loss (l) with the score 20-17. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. My task is to check if any row matches both the attendance figure and the result specified in the claim.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse the claim into two parts: the attendance number (76059) and the result (l 20 -17). So, I'm looking for a game where the attendance was exactly 76,059 and the result was a loss with the score of 20 to 17.\n\nNow, let me go through each row of the table to see if any match both criteria. \n\nStarting from week 1: \n- Attendance is 57406, which doesn't match. Result is l 27 -0, so not the same as l20-17.\n\nWeek 2:\n- Attendance 62063, result w23-17. Not a loss, so no match.\n\nWeek3:\n- Attendance 69814, result l20-7. Close score, but attendance doesn't match.\n\nWeek4: \n- Attendance44433, l21-14. Different score and attendance.\n\nWeek5: \n- Attendance64578, l20-6. Again, different score.\n\nWeek6: \n- Attendance52728, l31-14. Not the 20-17 score.\n\nWeek7:\n- Attendance76059. Oh, here's where attendance matches exactly 76,059. Now, what was the result? It shows l20-17. Yes! That matches both criteria.\n\nSo, in week7, we have the exact attendance number and the specified loss with a 20-17 score. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row.\n\nWait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Are there any other rows with attendance 76059? Scanning through all the weeks, it seems week7 is the only one with that exact number. So, no other relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cell is week7's result column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",
