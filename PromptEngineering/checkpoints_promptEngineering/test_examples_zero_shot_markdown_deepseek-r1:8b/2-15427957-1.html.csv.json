    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the first time they be in tier 1 be in 1999\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: season, tier, league, postseason, and european competitions. The claim is specifically about their first time being in tier 1. So, my focus should be on the \"tier\" column to find when they moved into tier 1.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1997-98: Tier 2\n- 1998-99: Tier 2\n- 1999-00: Tier 1\n\nSo, according to this, in the 1999-00 season, they first entered tier 1. That would make the claim true because the first occurrence of tier 1 is indeed in 1999.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if there are any other relevant columns that might affect this conclusion. The claim mentions \"they be in tier 1,\" so it's about their tier classification. Other columns like league or postseason don't directly relate to the tier level. Therefore, the only relevant column here is \"tier.\"\n\nSo, the key row to look at is 1999-00 where tier becomes 1. That means the first time they were in tier 1 was during that season, which aligns with the claim.\n\nI should also consider whether there are any other interpretations of the claim. For instance, does \"be in tier 1\" mean anything else? No, it's pretty straightforward\u2014it refers to their placement in the competition hierarchy.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing each row and focusing on the relevant column, I can confidently say that the claim is true because the first occurrence of tier 1 is in 1999.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the \"tier\" column where the first entry for tier 1 is in 1999. The relevant cell is from the 1999-00 season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tier\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the league be oberliga the last time the tier be 3.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the league being \"oberliga\" and the second part mentions it happening \"the last time the tier was 3.\" So essentially, I'm looking for the last instance where the tier was 3 and then checking if the league at that same point was the oberliga.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find where the tier is 3. Let me scan each season:\n\n- 1997-98: Tier 2\n- 1998-99: Tier 2\n- 1999-00: Tier 1\n- 2000-01: Tier 1\n- 2001-02: Tier 1\n- 2002-03: Tier 1\n- 2003-04: Tier 1\n- 2004-05: Tier 3\n- 2005-06: Tier 2\n- 2006-07: Tier 2\n- 2007-08: Tier 2\n- 2008-09: Tier 2\n- 2009-10: Tier 1\n- 2010-11: Tier 1\n- 2011-12: Tier 2\n- 2012-13: Tier 1\n\nFrom this, the only row where tier is 3 is 2004-05. So that's the last time tier was 3 because after that, in 2005-06 and onwards, the tier goes back to 2, then 1, etc.\n\nNow, I need to check what league corresponds to the 2004-05 season. Looking at the table, for 2004-05, the league is \"oberliga.\" So yes, when the tier was last 3 (in 2004-05), the league was oberliga.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because both conditions are met: during the last time tier was 3, the league was indeed oberliga.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tier\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"between 2000 and 2003, the only league represented be bundesliga.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various seasons from 1997-98 to 2012-13. Each row has columns for season, tier, league, postseason, and European competitions.\n\nMy task is to check between 2000 and 2003 (so seasons 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03) what leagues are listed. \n\nStarting with the 2000-01 season: The league is Bundesliga. \nNext, 2001-02: Also Bundesliga.\nThen, 2002-03: This one says \"-\". Hmm, so in that year, there's no data or perhaps they didn't participate in a league at that level.\n\nSo for 2000-01 and 2001-02, the only league is Bundesliga. But in 2002-03, it's missing. Therefore, between 2000 and 2003, were other leagues represented?\n\nWait, the claim says \"the only league represented be bundesliga.\" So does that mean there are no other leagues in that timeframe? \n\nLooking at the table, from 2000 to 2003:\n\n- 2000-01: Bundesliga\n- 2001-02: Bundesliga\n- 2002-03: No data (blank or dash)\nSo in those years, only Bundesliga is present. But wait, let me check if any other leagues appear in that range.\n\nLooking at seasons around it: \n\nIn 1998-99, they were in 2.bbl, but that's before 2000.\nIn 2004-05, they got promoted to Oberliga, which is a lower tier. But 2004 is after the timeframe specified (up to 2003).\n\nSo within 2000-03, only Bundesliga exists for those three seasons. Therefore, the claim says between 2000 and 2003, only Bundesliga was represented.\n\nBut wait, I notice that in 2002-03, there's a dash indicating no participation or no league data. So does that mean they weren't in any league? Or perhaps not listed because they were relegated?\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nIn 1999-00: Bundesliga and quarterfinalist.\n2000-01: Bundesliga, quarterfinalist, played Korac Cup.\n2001-02: Bundesliga, relegated.\n2002-03: Bundesliga with no data.\n2003-04: Bundesliga, FibA Europe Cup champion.\n\nSo in the seasons between 2000 and 2003 (including 2000-01 to 2002-03), the only league mentioned is Bundesliga except for 2002-03 which might not be listed. But perhaps in that season they were promoted or something else.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about the \"league\" represented. So if in 2002-03, there's a dash, maybe they weren't in any league at that tier? Or perhaps the table just doesn't list it because they were promoted to Bundesliga again.\n\nBut regardless, for the seasons between 2000 and 2003 (inclusive of both ends), only Bundesliga is mentioned. So the claim says that in this timeframe, the only league represented was Bundesliga.\n\nWait, but I should check if any other leagues are present during those years. For example, checking neighboring seasons:\n\nIn 1998-99: 2.bbl\n1999-00: Bundesliga\n2000-01: Bundesliga\n2001-02: Bundesliga\n2002-03: possibly no league or not listed.\nSo no other leagues in that period.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because only Bundesliga is present between 2000 and 2003. However, I need to check if any other cells might contradict this.\n\nWait, looking back at the table again:\n\nIn 2000-01: tier 1, Bundesliga\n2001-02: tier 1, relegated\n2002-03: tier 1, no data.\nSo in those three seasons (assuming 2000 to 2003 includes 2000-01, 2001-02, and 2002-03), only Bundesliga is mentioned. No other leagues are present.\n\nTherefore, the claim that between 2000 and 2003, the only league represented was Bundesliga seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis confirms that during the seasons from 2000 to 2003, the only league listed in the table is Bundesliga. No other leagues are mentioned for those years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells in the table that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"they be in the fiba europe cup champion european competition before 2005.\" To break this down, I think it's referring to whether any team associated with a particular European competition was a champion of the FIBA Europe Cup before the year 2005.\n\nLooking at the table provided, which seems to track information about seasons, tiers, leagues, postseason achievements, and European competitions participated in. The columns are: season (as years), tier, league, postseason, and European competitions.\n\nSo, the claim is about a team's participation in the FIBA Europe Cup as champions before 2005. I need to check if any row in the table indicates that a team was a champion of this competition before 2005.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one, starting from 1997-98 up to 2012-13, but since the claim is about before 2005, I can focus on rows up until 2004-05.\n\nStarting with 1997-98: tier 2, league 2.bbl, no postseason, no European competitions mentioned. So, no relevant info here.\n\n1998-99: tier 2, same league as above, promotion playoffs, but again, no European competition details. Not helpful.\n\n1999-00: tier 1, Bundesliga, quarterfinalist in the postseason, and mentions \"played korac cup.\" Wait, that's a different competition\u2014Korac Cup. So, not relevant to FIBA Europe Cup.\n\n2000-01: tier 1, Bundesliga again, quarterfinalist, but now it says they \"played korac cup\" as well. Again, Korac Cup is separate from the FIBA Europe Cup. So, no champions here either.\n\n2001-02: tier 1, Bundesliga, relegated from the league, no European competition info. No help.\n\n2002-03: tier 1, Bundesliga, no postseason details mentioned, and again no FIBA Europe Cup entry.\n\n2003-04: tier 1, Bundesliga, no postseason info, but now it says they were \"fiba europe cup champion.\" Wait, this row is for the season 2003-04. The claim is about before 2005. So, 2003 is definitely before 2005. Therefore, in this row, under \"European competitions,\" it's stated that they won the FIBA Europe Cup.\n\nThat seems to directly support the claim. Therefore, the relevant cell is for the 2003-04 season, specifically the European competitions column.\n\nI should also check if any other rows after 2004 might affect this, but since the claim is about before 2005, only up to 2004 is relevant. The next row is 2004-05: tier 3, Oberliga, promoted, no European competition mention. So, no impact here.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant cell is in the 2003-04 season under the \"European competitions\" column where it says they were FIBA Europe Cup champions.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that a team was a FIBA Europe Cup champion before 2005, we look for any entry in the table indicating such an achievement. The relevant cell is found in the 2003-04 season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"european competitions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the first time they be relegate in the postseason be before the first time they be promote in the postseason.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. Relegation and promotion are about the team moving up or down divisions. In sports leagues, teams can get promoted for winning enough games to move higher, or relegated for finishing too low, sometimes dropping into lower divisions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season from 1997-98 to 2012-13. The columns include tier, league, postseason details, and European competitions. I think the relevant parts here are when they were promoted or relegated in the postseason.\n\nI need to find two specific events: \n1. The first time they were relegated in the postseason.\n2. The first time they were promoted in the postseason.\n\nOnce I have those two times, I can see if the relegation happened before the promotion.\n\nStarting with the first relegation: Scanning each row for \"relegated\" under postseason. \n\n- 1997-98: No\n- 1998-99: Promotion playoffs (so not a relegation)\n- 1999-00: Quarterfinalist, no mention of relegation.\n- 2000-01: Quarterfinalist again.\n- 2001-02: Relegated. So that's the first time they were relegated in the postseason.\n\nNow for the first promotion in the postseason:\nLooking for \"promoted\" under postseason.\n\n- 1997-98: No\n- 1998-99: Promotion playoffs, which is a promotion.\nSo the first promotion in the postseason was 1998-99.\n\nWait, but the claim says the first time they be relegate in the postseason before the first promote. So their relegation happened in 2001-02 and promotion in 1998-99. But 1998 is earlier than 2001, so the promotion happened before the relegation. That would make the claim false because the first relegation was after the first promotion.\n\nBut I need to double-check if there's any other instance of promotion or relegation in the table that might affect this.\n\nLooking through the rest:\n\n- 1999-00: Quarterfinalist, no.\n- 2000-01: Quarterfinalist.\n- 2001-02: Relegated.\n- 2002-03: No.\n- 2003-04: Champion in some competition, but not sure if that's a promotion or European success.\n- 2004-05: Promoted (from Oberliga to 2. BBL), but was it in the postseason? The column says \"promoted,\" which is a result of their performance during the season, so I think it counts.\nWait, so 2004-05: promoted. That's another promotion.\n\nSo the promotions are at 1998-99 and 2004-05, and the first relegation is at 2001-02.\n\nSo the first promotion was in '98-'99, then the first relegation in '01-'02. So the claim would say that the first relegation happened before the first promotion, but actually, the promotion came first.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that the first promotion occurred in 1998-99 and the first relegation in 2001-02. Since promotion precedes relegation, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that during the years 2000-2003, among all leagues in those years, only the Bundesliga wasn't represented.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season with details like tier, league, etc. The years in the table are from 1997-98 up to 2012-13, but I'm focusing on 2000-03, which corresponds roughly to rows for 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03, and maybe 2003-04.\n\nWait, let me check the seasons: 2000-01 is row 4, 2001-02 is row5, 2002-03 is row6, 2003-04 is row7. So I need to look at these rows (rows 4 to 7) and see what leagues are present.\n\nThe claim says that in this period, the only league not represented is Bundesliga.

So the claim is saying that Bundesliga was not represented between those years, but according to the table, it's actually the opposite.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the last time they be in tier 1 be 1999.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. They're talking about the last time a team was in tier 1. Tier seems to refer to the competition level or division, like Bundesliga being tier 1 and others lower.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a \"tier\" column which has values like 2, 3, etc., but I don't see tier 4 or higher. So, perhaps tier 1 is the highest league in some contexts here. \n\nNext, the claim mentions the last time they were in tier 1 was 1999. So I need to find when a team was in tier 1 for the last time before 1999 and whether it's still in tier 1 after that or not.\n\nLooking at the table, let's see each season:\n\n- 1997-98: Tier 2\n- 1998-99: Tier 2\n- 1999-00: Tier 1\n- 2000-01: Tier 1\n- 2001-02: Tier 1\n- 2002-03: Tier 1\n- 2003-04: Tier 1\n- 2004-05: Tier 3\n- 2005-06: Tier 2\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, the claim says \"last time they be in tier 1 be 1999.\" But according to the table, after 1999-00 (tier 1), there are subsequent seasons where they were still in tier 1. For example, 2000-01 is tier 1, 2002-03 as well.\n\nSo maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It could be that the team was promoted back to tier 1 at some point and then again, but perhaps the last promotion or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to being relegated from tier 1, meaning they were in tier 1 until a certain point and then dropped down. Looking through the table:\n\nIn 2001-02, tier 1, but in 2002-03, still tier 1? No, let me check again.\n\nWait, the table shows for 1999-00: tier 1\n2000-01: tier 1\n2001-02: tier 1\nThen 2002-03: tier 1\n2003-04: tier 1\n2004-05: tier 3\nSo after 2004, they were in tier 3 and lower. Then later seasons show them back in tier 1 starting 2009-10.\n\nWait, in 2004-05, tier 3, then 2005-06: tier 2, 2006-07: tier 2, 2007-08: tier 2 (pro a), 2008-09: tier 2 promoted to pro a (maybe?), but I'm not sure. Then 2009-10: tier 1 again.\n\nSo in 2009-10, they were back in tier 1. So the last time before that would be 2004-05, when they were promoted from tier 3 to tier 2, or perhaps a different point.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the last time they be in tier 1 be 1999.\" So is it saying that the last time they were in tier 1 was in 1999? But according to the table, they stayed in tier 1 for several seasons after 1999. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because they were still in tier 1 later than 1999.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to their last promotion or something else. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the \"tier\" column and the \"postseason\" and \" european competitions\" columns might not be directly relevant unless the claim is about more than just being in a tier.\n\nWait, the claim is only about being in tier 1. So I need to focus on the \"tier\" column.\n\nFrom the table, after 1999-00 (tier 1), they were still in tier 1 until 2003-04. Then in 2004-05, they moved down to tier 3, but later seasons show them back in tier 2 or higher.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n2004-05: tier 3\n2005-06: tier 2\n2006-07: tier 2\n2007-08: tier 2 (pro a)\n2008-09: tier 2 promoted to pro a? Or is it that after 2008-09, they were promoted and hence in a higher tier?\n\nWait, the table for 2008-09 has \"promoted\" under league. Maybe that means they moved up to tier 1 or another higher tier.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The exact movement between tiers can be complex based on promotions and relegations.\n\nLooking back at the claim: it says the last time they were in tier 1 was 1999. So, if the table shows that after 1999-00, they stayed in tier 1 for several more seasons (2000-01, 2002-03, etc.), then the last time before 2009-10 would be 2003-04.\n\nWait, but according to the table:\n\n- 1997-98: tier 2\n- 1998-99: tier 2\n- 1999-00: tier 1\n- 2000-01: tier 1\n- 2001-02: tier 1\n- 2002-03: tier 1\n- 2003-04: tier 1\n- 2004-05: tier 3\n\nSo, the last time before 2004-05 when they were in tier 1 was 2003-04. Then they dropped to tier 3.\n\nBut then in 2009-10, they're back at tier 1 again. So if the claim is about the last time being 1999, that's incorrect because they spent several years after that in tier 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a specific event beyond just the tier level. For example, perhaps it was their last appearance in a European competition or something else. Looking at the \" european competitions\" column:\n\n- 1997-98: -\n- 1998-99: -\n- 1999-00: -\n- 2000-01: played korac cup\n- 2001-02: -\n- ... and so on.\n\nIn 2000-01, they played the korac cup. Then in 2003-04, is there anything? Doesn't look like it from the table provided.\n\nSo maybe the claim is trying to say that their last European competition was in 1999, but according to the data, it's 2000-01 for the korac cup.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. The claim is about being in tier 1, so perhaps not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific competition or event beyond just the tier level, but based on the info given, it seems they stayed in tier 1 until 2003-04.\n\nSo, if the claim says that the last time was in 1999, and according to the data, they were still in tier 1 until at least 2003-04, then the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer would be that the claim is false because they remained in tier 1 after 1999.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting something. Maybe the user is referring to a specific type of competition or tier within tier 1, but based on what's provided, it seems they were still in tier 1 for multiple seasons after 1999.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be that the last time they were in tier 1 was not in 1999 but several years later, such as 2003-04.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the last time the team was in Tier 1 was in 1999 is incorrect. According to the provided data, the team remained in Tier 1 until at least the 2003-04 season. Therefore, they were still competing in Tier 1 after 1999.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false. The team stayed in Tier 1 beyond 1999, with their last season there being during the 2003-04 campaign before moving down to Tier 3.",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"oberliga be promote in the postseason before the last time the tier be 3.\"\n\nSo, I'm looking for instances where 'oberliga' was promoted during the postseason when the tier was 3. \n\nLooking at the table, the 'tier' column is important. We're interested in rows where the tier is 3. From the table, tier 3 occurs only once: in 2004-05 season, with the tier being 3 and league as oberliga.\n\nNow, check if that particular row has a promotion in the postseason. The 'postseason' column for 2004-05 is \"promoted.\" So yes, they were promoted that season.\n\nNext, I need to find the last occurrence where the tier was 3. Since it only happens once (tier 3 in 2004-05), there isn't a later instance to compare before or after.\n\nSo, the condition is met for that one row: when tier is 3 and league is oberliga, promotion happened in the postseason. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying which cells are relevant. The relevant rows would be where both 'tier' is 3 and 'league' is oberliga. That's only row 2004-05 (index 8), columns: tier and league.\n\nSo, the JSON should include that cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tier\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"they be in the fiba europe cup champion europ[ean competition before 2005\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It seems to be saying that during a certain season before 2005, the team was the FIBA Europe Cup champion in European competitions.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a season from 1997-98 up to 2012-13. The columns include 'season', 'tier', 'league', 'postseason', and 'european competitions'. \n\nI need to check if any of these seasons before 2005 (so up to 2004) have the team listed as a FIBA Europe Cup champion in their European competitions column.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n- 1997-98: tier 2, league 2.bbl. Postseason is -, European competitions are -. So no.\n- 1998-99: tier 2, same as above, and postseason is promotion playoffs. No mention of FIBA Europe Cup.\n- 1999-00: tier 1 in Bundesliga, quarterfinalist, and European competitions say played korac cup. Not FIBA Europe Cup.\n- 2000-01: tier 1, Bundesliga, quarterfinalist again, but European competitions now include 'played korac cup'. Still not FIBA Europe Cup.\n- 2001-02: tier 1, relegated, and European comps are -. No.\n- 2002-03: tier 1, no info in European comps. No.\n- 2003-04: tier 1, Bundesliga, and European comps say 'fiba europe cup champion'. Wait, that's the row for 2003-04. But 2004 is still before 2005, right? Because 2003-04 season ends in 2004.\n\nSo the claim says \"before 2005\", which would include seasons up to and including 2004. So the 2003-04 season's European competitions entry is 'fiba europe cup champion', which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a season before 2005 where they were FIBA Europe Cup champions in their European competitions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"european competitions\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"the first time they be relegate in the postseason be after the first time they be promote in the postseason.\" So, we're looking for two specific events in the table: the first promotion in the postseason and the first relegation in the postseason. The claim claims that the first relegation happens after the first promotion.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify when each team was promoted or relegated during the postseason. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from 1997-98, the tier is 2 and league is BBL. Postseason result is '-', so no action there.\n\n1998-99: Tier 2, BBL, promotion playoffs. This seems like a promotion scenario, but I need to check if it's the first promotion in the postseason.\n\n1999-00: Tier 1, Bundesliga, quarterfinalist. No promotion or relegation here.\n\n2000-01: Tier 1, Bundesliga, quarterfinalist, and they played the Korac Cup. Not relevant for promotion or relegation.\n\n2001-02: Tier 1, Bundesliga, relegated. That's a relegation, but I need to see if it's their first in the postseason.\n\nWait, let me note that in 1998-99, there was a promotion playoff, which is a promotion. Then in 2001-02, they were relegated. So the first promotion in the postseason happened in 1998-99 and the first relegation in the postseason happened in 2001-02. \n\nSo according to the table, the first promotion was in 1998-99, and the first relegation was later in 2001-02. Therefore, the first relegation occurred after the first promotion.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure there are no earlier promotions or relegations. Let's check if any other rows show promotions or relegations before 2001-02.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n1997-98: No\n1998-99: Promotion playoffs (promotion)\n1999-00: Quarterfinalist, not promoted or relegated.\n2000-01: Played Korac Cup, not promotion or relegation in the league.\n2001-02: Relegated.\n\nSo yes, the first promotion in the postseason was 1998-99, and the first relegation was 2001-02. So the claim holds true because the first relegation happened after the first promotion.\n\nWait a second, but I need to confirm if \"postseason\" is clearly indicated. For example, in 1998-99, it's mentioned as promotion playoffs. Does that count as a promotion in the postseason?\n\nYes, promotion playoffs are part of the postseason process where they get promoted. So that counts as a promotion in the postseason.\n\nSimilarly, in 2001-02, they were relegated during the season, which would be considered in the postseason context.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is true because the first time they were relegated in the postseason was after the first time they were promoted in the postseason.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are row indices 2 (2001-02) for relegation and row index 1 (1998-99) for promotion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
