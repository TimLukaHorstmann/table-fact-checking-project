    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"mark farraway be pick 7 pick after chad folk\" is true based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Mark Farraway was picked in the 7th position after Chad Folk. So, I need to check if Mark Farraway is indeed picked at pick number 7 and if Chad Folk was picked before him, i.e., with a lower pick number.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find both players. \n\nStarting from row 1: The first pick is Chad Folk for the Toronto Argonauts as an OL from Utah. So that's Chad Folk at pick 1.\n\nNext, I need to find Mark Farraway. Scanning down, in row 8, it says Mark Farraway was picked by Edmonton as a DL from St. Francis Xavier. The pick number here is 8. Wait, but the claim says he was picked at position 7. That's conflicting.\n\nSo, according to the table, Mark Farraway is pick 8. But the claim states that he was pick 7. That already seems incorrect.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Looking back:\n\nPick 1: Chad Folk\nPick 2: Ben Fairbrother\nPick 3: Ian Franklin\nPick 4: Tim Prinsen\nPick 5: Doug Brown\nPick 6: Steve Charbonneau\nPick 7: Jason Clemett\nPick 8: Mark Farraway\n\nSo yes, Mark is pick 8. The claim says he was picked at position 7 after Chad Folk. That's wrong because he was actually picked later.\n\nAlso, Chad Folk was pick 1 and Mark Farraway was pick 8, so the order is correct that Chad was picked before Mark, but their positions are different from what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cfl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"both doug brown and jason clemett be pick that come from simon fraser.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that both Doug Brown and Jason Clemett were selected (picked) by teams from Simon Fraser. So, I need to check each player mentioned in the claim against the table to see if they are picked by teams affiliated with Simon Fraser.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows. Each row has a pick number, CFL team name, player, position, and college attended. \n\nStarting with Doug Brown: From the table, I see that Doug Brown is listed in pick #5 under the Calgary Stampeders. His college is Simon Fraser. So that's one part of the claim checked.\n\nNext, Jason Clemett: Looking through the table, pick #7 lists Jason Clemett as a player for the Calgary team. However, his college is also listed as Simon Fraser. Wait, but in the table, under row 7, the college column says \"simon fraser\" (with a typo, probably). So both Doug Brown and Jason Clemett are from Simon Fraser.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check each player's details. Let me go through each relevant pick:\n\nPick #5: Calgary Stampeders, Doug Brown, college Simon Fraser. That matches.\nPick #7: Calgary, Jason Clemett, college Simon Fraser. That also matches.\n\nSo both players are from Simon Fraser and were picked by teams (Calgary in this case). The claim says \"both...be pick that come from simon fraser.\" So it seems to hold true based on the table.\n\nI need to find which cells are relevant. For each player, I'll note their row index and the columns checked: primarily the 'player' and 'college' columns.\n\nFor Doug Brown:\n- Row index 5.\n- Columns checked: player (Doug Brown) and college (Simon Fraser).\n\nFor Jason Clemett:\n- Row index 7.\n- Columns checked: player (Jason Clemett) and college (Simon Fraser).\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 5 and 7, specifically the 'player' and 'college' columns where applicable.\n\nI should make sure there's no mistake. Let me check each pick again.\n\nPick #5 is Calgary Stampeders, Doug Brown, position DL, college Simon Fraser. Correct.\nPick #7 is Calgary, Jason Clemett, position LB, college Simon Fraser. Correct.\n\nNo other picks in the table mention Simon Fraser besides these two. So both players are indeed from Simon Fraser and were picked by their respective teams, which are part of the CFL.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify that both Doug Brown and Jason Clemett are players selected (picks) by teams affiliated with Simon Fraser University.\n\n1. **Doug Brown**: \n   - Found in pick #5 under Calgary Stampeders.\n   - College: Simon Fraser.\n   \n2. **Jason Clemett**:\n   - Found in pick #7 under Calgary.\n   - College: Simon Fraser.\n\nBoth players are from Simon Fraser and were picked by teams, fulfilling the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"draft pick from calgary stampeders , montreal alouettes and edmonton play the position dl\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of this claim means. It seems like it's saying that in the draft picks for these three teams (Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, Edmonton), there are players who are playing the 'dl' (defensive lineman) position.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each team mentioned and see if any of their draft picks are listed as defensive linemen. The relevant columns in the table are 'cfl team', 'player', 'position', and 'college'.\n\nStarting with Calgary Stampeders: In row 5, the player is Doug Brown with a position of dl and college Simon Fraser. So that's one player from Calgary who plays dl.\n\nNext, Montreal Alouettes: There's no entry for them in this table, as the table only goes up to pick number 8 and doesn't list all teams. Since there's no data on Montreal, I can\u2019t confirm if they have any draft picks at dl based on this table.\n\nThen, Edmonton: In row 3, Ian Franklin is listed with position cb (cornerback), so that's not a defensive lineman. There's also pick number 8 for Edmonton, which is Mark Farraway playing dl. So that's another player from Edmonton who plays dl.\n\nSo, out of the three teams mentioned in the claim\u2014Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, and Edmonton\u2014we have information for Calgary (Doug Brown) and Edmonton (Mark Farraway). Both are defensive linemen. Since at least some draft picks from these teams play the position dl, the claim seems to hold true based on the provided data.\n\nHowever, since there's no data for Montreal Alouettes in the table, I can't confirm if they have any such players. But the presence of two out of three teams with defensive linemen picked up would still make the overall statement TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be 1 more dl position than there be player who play the position of ol.\" So, I need to check if the number of players in the 'dl' (defensive lineman) position is exactly one more than the number of players listed as offensive linemen ('ol').\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a pick number, team name, player, position, and college. My focus here is on two columns: 'position' and possibly 'player', but mostly 'position'. I need to count how many times 'dl' appears in the 'position' column and how many times 'ol' does as well.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Pick 1: Toronto Argonauts, Chad Folk, OL, Utah. So that's an 'ol'.\n2. Pick 2: Saskatchewan Roughriders, Ben Fairbrother, OL, Calgary. Another 'ol'.\n3. Pick 3: Edmonton Eskimos, Ian Franklin, CB. Not relevant for either.\n4. Pick 4: Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Tim Prinsen, OG. Also not relevant.\n5. Pick 5: Calgary Stampeders, Doug Brown, DL. So that's a 'dl'.\n6. Pick 6: Montreal Alouettes, Steve Charbonneau, DL. Another 'dl'.\n7. Pick 7: Calgary, Jason Clemett, LB. Not relevant.\n8. Pick 8: Edmonton, Mark Farraway, DL. That's another 'dl'.\n\nWait, let me count the 'ol' positions first. From rows 1 and 2, there are two 'ol' players.\n\nNow for 'dl': rows 5,6,8 have 'dl', so that's three players.\n\nSo, the claim says there should be one more 'dl' than 'ol'. Let me check: 3 (dl) minus 2 (ol) equals 1. So yes, there is exactly one more 'dl'.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let me go through each again quickly:\n\n- Row 1: OL\n- Row 2: OL\n- Row 3: CB\n- Row 4: OG\n- Row 5: DL\n- Row 6: DL\n- Row 7: LB\n- Row 8: DL\n\nYes, that's correct. So the count is two 'ol' and three 'dl'. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table.

The claim is: \"the draft pick by calgary be pick pick before the player , mark farraway.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, I see each row has columns: pick, cfl team, player, position, college. So, to verify the claim, I need to find where Calgary is the CFL team and Mark Farraway is the player.\n\nStarting with the CFL team being Calgary. Scanning the rows:\n\nRow 5: Calgary Stampeders\nRow 7: Calgary\n\nSo, two entries for Calgary. Now, looking for Mark Farraway as a player.\n\nIn the table, I see players like Chad Folk, Ben Fairbrother, Ian Franklin, Tim Prinsen, Doug Brown, Steve Charbonneau, Jason Clemett, and Mark Farraway is in row 8.\n\nNow, the claim says \"the draft pick by calgary be pick pick before the player , mark farraway.\" I think it's trying to say that Calgary's draft pick (the 'pick' number) is earlier (i.e., a lower number) than Mark Farraway's position in the table.\n\nWait, but the columns are pick, cfl team, player, etc. So for each row, the pick number corresponds to their order. The claim might be about whether Calgary's draft picks are before Mark Farraway's entry.\n\nBut looking at the table, Mark Farraway is in row 8. So I need to check if all of Calgary's draft picks (rows 5 and 7) have lower pick numbers than row 8.\n\nRow 5: pick 5\nRow 7: pick 7\nRow 8: pick 8\n\nSo both Calgary picks are before Mark Farraway, whose row is 8. Therefore, the claim that \"Calgary's draft pick(s) are before Mark Farraway\" is TRUE because their pick numbers (5 and 7) are lower than 8.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the draft pick by calgary be pick pick before the player , mark farraway.\" It might mean that each of Calgary's picks are earlier in the table than Mark. Since table rows go from top to bottom, with lower pick numbers first.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"jason clemett be pick after the player mark farraway\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. \"Pick\" in the context of a draft usually refers to a player's position in that year's selection order. So, if Jason Clemett was picked after Mark Farraway, that would mean Mark Farraway was selected earlier than Jason Clemett.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify where both players are listed. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: pick 1, player is Chad Folk.\nRow 2: pick 2, Ben Fairbrother.\nRow3: pick3, Ian Franklin.\nRow4: pick4, Tim Prinsen.\nRow5: pick5, Doug Brown.\nRow6: pick6, Steve Charbonneau.\nRow7: pick7, Jason Clemett.\nRow8: pick8, Mark Farraway.\n\nSo, Jason Clemett is in row 7 and Mark Farraway is in row8. That means in the draft order, Mark Farraway was picked at position8, and Jason Clemett at position7. So Mark was picked after Jason. Therefore, the claim that \"jason clemett be pick after mark farraway\" is actually false because Jason was picked earlier, not after.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim says jason clemett is a pick after mark farraway. So in the table, lower pick numbers mean earlier selections. Pick1 is first, then pick2, etc. So if Jason Clemett is at pick7 and Mark Farraway is at pick8, that means Mark was picked later, so Jason was before him. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Jason was not picked after Mark; Mark was picked after Jason.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the ones for Jason Clemett and Mark Farraway. Looking back at the table structure: columns are pick, cfl team, player, position, college. So for each of them, their row indices are 7 (Jason) and8 (Mark). The relevant columns would be all columns except maybe pick since that's just the number, but to confirm their details.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to list all relevant cells, which would be all columns for both players. So each player has row_index and column names. So Jason is at row7 in columns: cfl team, player, position, college. Mark is at row8 with same columns.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because Jason was picked before Mark, not after. And the relevant cells are all the columns for both players.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"cfl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"cfl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
