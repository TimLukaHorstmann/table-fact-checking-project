    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the title total forest area have a rank smaller than 71 out of 220 , and a year later than 2005.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to data in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe first part of the claim is about the \"total forest area\" having a rank smaller than 71 out of 220. Looking at the table, there's an entry for \"total forest area\" with a rank of 47 and the year 2007. So I'll need to check this row because it directly relates to \"total forest area.\"\n\nNext, the second part of the claim mentions that the year is later than 2005. The \"total forest area\" entry is from 2007, which is indeed after 2005.\n\nNow, to verify the claim, I should look for cells related to these two points: rank and year for \"total forest area.\" From the table, the relevant columns are \"rank,\" \"out of,\" and \"year.\" The specific row in question is the one where \"name\" is \"total forest area.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n1. Row index 8 (since the first data row starts at index 0), column name \"rank.\"\n2. Row index 8, column name \"year.\"\n\nI should check if both conditions hold true based on these cells.\n\nFor the rank: The rank is 47, which is indeed smaller than 71 out of 220. So that condition is satisfied.\n\nFor the year: It's 2007, which is after 2005. That also holds true.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the 1994 title biodiversity richness have a rank smaller than 54.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the relevant information. Let's go through each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the table headers, I see columns like name, rank, out of, source, and year. The claim mentions \"biodiversity richness\" as the title for a specific year. So I need to find that exact entry.\n\nScanning the rows:\n\n1. The first row is \"environmental sustainability index,\" not relevant.\n2. Next, \"greenhouse emissions per capita\"\u2014nope.\n3. \"number of species under threat of extinction\"\u2014still not it.\n4. \"happy planet index\"\u2014no.\n5. \"environmental performance index\"\u2014not the one.\n6. \"total renewable water resources\"\u2014nope.\n7. \"water availability per capita\"\u2014doesn't fit.\n8. \"biodiversity richness\" here\u2014year is 1994. So this is the row we need.\n\nNow, looking at the rank for biodiversity richness: it's 13. The out of column says 53. So the rank is 13, and the total was 53. \n\nThe claim says the rank is smaller than 54. Since 13 is less than 54, that's true. Wait, but let me double-check if I got the \"out of\" value right. For biodiversity richness, out of is 53, meaning it's ranked against a certain number of countries or indices. So the rank is 13 out of 53.\n\nTherefore, the rank is indeed smaller than 54 because 13 < 54. So the claim holds as true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is where \"biodiversity richness\" with the year 1994 is located. Its rank is 13, which is less than 54.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the source for the rank of 78 be yale university / columbia university.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate where the rank of 78 comes from in the table. Let me look at each row's rank column until I find the one with 78.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The first row has a rank of 132.\n- Second: 74\n- Third: 37\n- Fourth: 81\n- Fifth: 78\n\nAh, there it is. The fifth row has a rank of 78. Now, I need to check what the source for that rank is. According to the table, the fifth row's source is \"yale university / columbia university.\"\n\nSo, the claim says exactly that: the source is Yale and Columbia universities combined. That matches the table data.\n\nWait, but let me double-check in case I misread something. The fifth row is about \"environmental performance index\" with rank 78, source yale/columbia. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the source listed for rank 78 is indeed Yale and Columbia universities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"source\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"For 2007, total forest area has a rank higher than 50 and an out of 220.\" \n\nSo, breaking it down, there are two parts here. First, the rank for total forest area in 2007 should be higher than 50. Second, the 'out of' value for that same entry is 220.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the row corresponding to \"total forest area\" and the year 2007. Let me scan through each row to locate that specific entry.\n\nI see several rows with similar names like \"environmental sustainability index,\" \"greenhouse emissions per capita,\" etc. Then, near the end of the table, there's a row labeled \"total forest area.\" The details for this row are: rank 47, out of 220, year 2007, and source is United Nations from 2007.\n\nSo, checking the rank first: 47. The claim says the rank is higher than 50. Since 47 is less than 50, that part isn't satisfied. Even though the 'out of' value matches (220), the rank doesn't meet the condition stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the total forest area's rank in 2007 is 47, which is not higher than 50.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where \"total forest area\" and \"year\" match the criteria. The rank of 47 does not exceed 50, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"total forest area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Specifically, it's the \"biodiversity richness\" entry.\n\nNow, I need to check the rank associated with that biodiversity index. From the table, under the \"rank\" column for the \"biodiversity richness\" row, it says 13. So the biodiversity rank in 1994 was 13.\n\nThe claim states that this rank is higher than 75. Well, 13 is definitely less than 75.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"yale university / columbia university be the source that have the rank of lower than 78.\" So, the claim is saying that Yale or Columbia University (or both) are the sources where the rank is below 78.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several entries. The relevant columns here are \"source\" and \"rank\". The claim specifically mentions the source, so I need to check which rows have a source of \"yale university / columbia university\".\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The row for \"environmental performance index\" has a source of \"yale university / columbia university\" and a rank of 78.\n\nSo, that's exactly where the claim would be true because their rank is 78. But wait, the claim says \"lower than 78\". Since 78 is not lower than itself, that specific row doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, but I need to check if there are any other rows with that same source. From the table, it seems only the environmental performance index has that combined source. So, in that case, the rank is exactly 78, not lower.\n\nTherefore, since none of the sources \"yale university / columbia university\" have a rank below 78, the claim should be considered FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I might be misunderstanding the claim. It says \"be the source that have the rank of lower than 78.\" So maybe it's referring to any of their sources. But in this table, only one row has Yale/Columbia as the source, and its rank is exactly 78, not below. Therefore, there are no rows where their rank is lower than 78.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
