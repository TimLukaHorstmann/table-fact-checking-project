    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the crowd be bigger at the game at junction oval than at kardinia park.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant information about the crowds at these two venues. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Since the claim is comparing the crowd sizes at two specific venues\u2014junction oval and kardinia park\u2014I should focus on the \"crowd\" column for these venues.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about st kilda vs. south melbourne at moorabbin oval with a crowd of 16205.\n2. The second row is melbourne vs. richmond at mcg with 37732 people.\n3. The third row is collingwood vs. hawthorn at victoria park with 41312 attendees.\n4. The fourth row is geelong vs. footscray at kardinia park with 17864 in the crowd.\n5. The fifth row is north melbourne vs. essendon at arden street oval with 8733 people.\n6. The sixth row is fitzroy vs. carlton at junction oval, which had a crowd of 22413.\n\nSo, from this table, I need to find the crowds for junction oval and kardinia park.\n\n- Junction oval: Looking at the last row (fitzroy vs. carlton), the crowd is 22413.\n- Kardinia park: In the fourth row (geelong vs. footscray), the crowd was 17864.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 22413 vs. 17864. Since 22413 is larger than 17864, the claim that the crowd at junction oval is bigger than at kardinia park seems to be TRUE.\n\nI should also note down which cells are relevant. For junction oval, it's row index 5 (since rows start from 0) and \"crowd\" column. For kardinia park, it's row index 3 in the same column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true, we compare the crowd sizes at junction oval and kardinia park based on the table data.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Junction oval: Row 5 (index 5), \"crowd\" column.\n- Kardinia park: Row 3 (index 3), \"crowd\" column.\n\nThe crowd at junction oval (22,413) is larger than that at kardinia park (17,864).\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant cells:**  \n[{\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"}, {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"}]\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table headers, there's a column named \"crowd\". So, I'll focus on this column for both Moorabbin Oval and Arden Street Oval.\n\nNext, I'll search through each row for Moorabbin Oval. Scanning down, I see that in the first row (row_index 0), the home team is St Kilda, and the venue is Moorabbin Oval with a crowd of 16205. That's one relevant cell: row 0, column \"crowd\".\n\nNow, for Arden Street Oval, I'll check each row until I find that venue. Looking through the rows, in the fifth row (row_index 4), the home team is North Melbourne at Arden Street Oval with a crowd of 8733. So, this is another relevant cell: row 4, column \"crowd\".\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: Moorabbin Oval had 16205 people, while Arden Street Oval had 8733. Since 16205 is greater than 8733, the claim that the crowd at Moorabbin Oval is bigger than that at Arden Street Oval is TRUE.\n\nI should also make sure I didn't miss any other instances of these venues in the table. Scanning through again, only row 0 has Moorabbin Oval and row 4 has Arden Street Oval.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the game at arden street oval have a smaller crowd than the game at junction oval.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing two venues: Arden Street Oval and Junction Oval. Specifically, it says that the game at Arden Street had fewer people attending (smaller crowd) compared to the game at Junction Oval.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"venue,\" and \"crowd.\" But for this claim, I'm specifically interested in the venues Arden Street Oval and Junction Oval. So, I need to find which rows correspond to these two venues.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's venue column:\n\n1. Moorabbin Oval \u2013 not relevant.\n2. MCG \u2013 not relevant.\n3. Victoria Park \u2013 not relevant.\n4. Kardinia Park \u2013 not relevant.\n5. Arden Street Oval \u2013 this is one of the venues we're comparing.\n6. Junction Oval \u2013 this is the other venue.\n\nSo, rows 5 and 6 are the ones to focus on. Now, I need to check their respective crowd numbers.\n\nRow 5 (north melbourne vs essendon at Arden Street Oval) has a crowd of 8,733.\nRow 6 (fitzroy vs carlton at Junction Oval) has a crowd of 22,413.\n\nThe claim states that the game at Arden Street had a smaller crowd. Comparing these two numbers: 8,733 is indeed less than 22,413. Therefore, the statement seems to be TRUE based on the crowd figures provided in the table.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that each step is correct. Maybe double-check if there are any other games at these venues? Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 0: st kilda vs south melbourne \u2013 venue Moorabbin Oval\n- Row 1: melbourne vs richmond \u2013 MCG\n- Row 2: collingwood vs hawthorn \u2013 Victoria Park\n- Row 3: geelong vs footscray \u2013 Kardinia Park\n- Row 4: north melbourne vs essendon \u2013 Arden Street Oval (crowd 8,733)\n- Row 5: fitzroy vs carlton \u2013 Junction Oval (crowd 22,413)\n\nYes, only rows 4 and 5 are the games at these two venues. So the comparison is between these two specific games.\n\nThe claim says that Arden Street's game had a smaller crowd than Junction Oval's game. Since 8,733 < 22,413, this is correct. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells part: I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. Each relevant cell would correspond to the venue and its crowd number.\n\nLooking at row 4 (north melbourne vs essendon), column \"crowd\" is 8,733. So that's one cell.\nRow 5 (fitzroy vs carlton), column \"crowd\" is 22,413. That's another cell.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 4, column \"crowd\"\n- Row index 5, column \"crowd\"\n\nWait, but in the table provided, row indices start at 0. So row 4 is the fifth game (north melbourne vs essendon), and row 5 is the sixth game (fitzroy vs carlton).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 4,\n  \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n}\n\nThat's two cells. I think that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is TRUE because Arden Street Oval's game had a smaller crowd than Junction Oval's game, and the relevant cells are row 4 and 5 for their respective crowd numbers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the game at victoria park have a larger crowd than the game at kardinia park.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. My main focus here is on the 'crowd' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI need to find out which rows correspond to the games at Victoria Park and Kardinia Park. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. The first row: home team is St Kilda, venue is Moorabbin Oval. That's not Victoria or Kardinia.\n2. Second row: Melbourne vs Richmond at MCG. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs Hawthorn at Victoria Park. This is one of the venues mentioned in the claim.\n4. Fourth row: Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park. Another venue in the claim.\n5. Fifth row: North Melbourne vs Essendon at Arden Street Oval. Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: Fitzroy vs Carlton at Junction Oval. Also not relevant.\n\nSo, from this table, there are two games of interest:\n- Collingwood vs Hawthorn at Victoria Park with a crowd of 41312.\n- Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park with a crowd of 17864.\n\nNow, comparing the two crowds: 41,312 versus 17,864. Clearly, Victoria Park had a larger crowd than Kardinia Park.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. I should also note which cells are relevant. Each game's row has the venue and crowd columns. So for Collingwood's game at Victoria Park, it's row index 2 (since we start counting from 0), columns 'crowd' and 'venue'. For Geelong's game at Kardinia Park, it's row index 3 with the same columns.\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check the rows. The first row is index 0, so Collingwood is row 2 (index 2) because:\n\n- Row 0: St Kilda\n- Row 1: Melbourne\n- Row 2: Collingwood\n- Row 3: Geelong\n\nYes, that's correct.

Let's look at the columns in the table. We have home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim is about comparing the crowd numbers at two venues: junction oval and kardinia park.\n\nSo I need to find the row for junction oval and the row for kardinia park. Then, extract their respective crowd numbers and compare them.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first column under \"venue\" is st kilda vs south melbourne at Moorabbin Oval.\n- Next, Melbourne vs Richmond at MCG.\n- Collingwood vs Hawthorn at Victoria Park.\n- Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park. So this is the row for kardinia park with a crowd of 17864.\n- North Melbourne vs Essendon at Arden Street Oval.\n- Fitzroy vs Carlton at Junction Oval. This must be the junction oval game with a crowd of 22413.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row index 5 (Fitzroy vs Carlton at Junction Oval) and row index 3 (Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park).\n\nNext, compare their crowd numbers. The crowd at Junction Oval is 22,413 and at Kardinia Park it's 17,864.\n\nSince 22,413 is larger than 17,864, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into a JSON object with \"answer\" as \"TRUE\" and list the relevant cells. Each cell has \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about the crowd size is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the crowd at junction oval be 3 times bigger than the game at kardinia park.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's comparing the crowd numbers from two specific venues: Junction Oval and Kardinia Park. The claim states that the crowd at Junction Oval is three times larger than the one at Kardinia Park.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are several rows, each representing a game. Each row has columns for home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. My task is to find the relevant cells in this table that support or refute the claim.\n\nI need to identify which games were played at Junction Oval and Kardinia Park because the claim refers to specific venues. So, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Venue is Moorabbin Oval. Not relevant.\n2. **Second Row**: Venue is MCG. Not relevant.\n3. **Third Row**: Venue is Victoria Park. Not relevant.\n4. **Fourth Row**: Venue is Kardinia Park. This seems relevant because it's one of the venues mentioned in the claim.\n5. **Fifth Row**: Venue is Arden Street Oval. Not relevant.\n6. **Sixth Row**: Venue is Junction Oval. This is also relevant.\n\nSo, I have two relevant rows: the fourth row (Kardinia Park) and the sixth row (Junction Oval). The crowd sizes for these games need to be checked.\n\nLooking at the crowd column:\n- For Kardinia Park (fourth row), the crowd is 17,864.\n- For Junction Oval (sixth row), the crowd is 22,413.\n\nNow, I need to check if the crowd at Junction Oval is three times bigger than at Kardinia Park. To do this, I'll calculate 3 times the crowd size of Kardinia Park and see if it equals or is close enough to the Junction Oval crowd.\n\nCalculating:\n- 3 \u00d7 17,864 = 53,592.\n\nNow, compare this with the Junction Oval crowd of 22,413. Clearly, 22,413 is less than 53,592, which means the claim doesn't hold true. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that both venues are home and away or if one is a particular team's home ground. The Junction Oval is where Fitzroy played against Carlton, while Kardinia Park is where Geelong played against Footscray. So, each game is between two teams, but regardless of which team it is, the claim is purely about the crowd size.\n\nSince 22,413 (Junction Oval) is approximately half of 53,592, the claim that it's three times bigger is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the crowd at Junction Oval is not three times larger than at Kardinia Park based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The venues mentioned in the claim are McG and junction oval. So I need to identify the corresponding rows for each of these venues.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that:\n\n- For McG, the row is 1 (since it's the second entry in the table). The home team there is Melbourne, and the crowd is 37732.\n- For junction oval, looking through the table, it's the fifth entry. Wait, no\u2014the fifth row has arden street oval as the venue. Hmm, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, the first row is st kilda vs south melbourne at moorabbin oval with a crowd of 16205.\nSecond row: Melbourne vs Richmond at McG with 37732.\nThird: Collingwood vs Hawthorn at Victoria Park with 41312.\nFourth: Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park, crowd 17864.\nFifth: North Melbourne vs Essendon at Arden Street Oval with 8733.\nSixth: Fitzroy vs Carlton at Junction Oval with 22413.\n\nWait, so the junction oval is the sixth row. That means the game at Junction Oval had a crowd of 22,413 people.\n\nThe claim says that the game at McG has a smaller crowd than the one at Junction Oval. So comparing the two crowds: 37,732 (McG) and 22,413 (Junction Oval). \n\nWait, no, 37,732 is larger than 22,413. That would mean that McG's crowd is bigger, not smaller. Therefore, the claim is saying the opposite of what is true.\n\nBut wait, maybe I got confused with which game is at each venue. Let me double-check. The second row is Melbourne vs Richmond at McG, crowd 37,732. Junction Oval is the sixth row: Fitzroy vs Carlton, crowd 22,413.\n\nSo yes, McG's crowd is larger than Junction Oval's.

The claim specifically mentions two venues: Moorabbin Oval and Junction Oval. So my focus should be on finding the crowd numbers for these two locations.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, along with details like scores, venue, crowd size, and date. I need to scan through each row to find where Moorabbin Oval and Junction Oval are listed as venues.\n\nStarting from the top, the first row has \"moorabbin oval\" as the venue with a crowd of 16205. That's one data point for Moorabbin Oval. Next, moving down the rows:\n\n- The second row is at McG, which isn't relevant here.\n- Third row: Victoria Park, nope.\n- Fourth row: Kardinia Park, not Junction Oval.\n- Fifth row: Arden Street Oval, not relevant.\n- Sixth row: Junction Oval with a crowd of 22413.\n\nSo I've identified two entries. Moorabbin Oval has a crowd of 16205, and Junction Oval has 22413. Now, comparing these numbers: 16205 is less than 22413. Therefore, the crowd at Moorabbin Oval is indeed smaller than that at Junction Oval.\n\nThe claim states the opposite\u2014that Moorabbin's crowd is bigger\u2014so this would be FALSE based on the data provided.

Each row represents a different game on the same date (21 August 1971), so all games were played on that day, which might mean they are part of a single event or concurrent matches.\n\nNow, I need to identify which rows correspond to Victoria Park, Kardinia Park, and MCG. \n\nStarting with Victoria Park: The table has a column called \"venue\" with entries like \"moorabbin oval,\" \"mcg,\" \"victoria park,\" etc. Scanning each row:\n\n- st kilda vs south melbourne is at moorabbin oval.\n- melbourne vs richmond is at MCG.\n- collingwood vs hawthorn is at Victoria Park.\n- geelong vs footscray is at Kardinia Park.\n- north melbourne vs essendon is at arden street oval.\n- fitzroy vs carlton is at junction oval.\n\nSo, the relevant rows for our claim are:\n1. Collingwood vs Hawthorn at Victoria Park: The crowd here is 41312.\n2. Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park: Crowd is 17864.\n3. Melbourne vs Richmond at MCG: Crowd is 37732.\n\nThe claim compares the crowd at Victoria Park to the combined crowds of Kardinia Park and MCG. So I need to add the crowds from Kardinia Park (17864) and MCG (37732) and see if that total is less than, equal to, or greater than Victoria Park's crowd (41312).\n\nLet me do the math:\nKardinia Park + MCG = 17864 + 37732. Let me add these two numbers.\n18,864 plus 37,732: \n- Adding the ten thousands: 1 + 3 = 4 ten thousand.\n- Thousands place: 8 + 7 = 15 thousand. Wait, no, actually, let's do it properly.\n\nWait, 17864 is approximately 17,864 and 37732 is about 37,732. Adding them:\n17,864\n+37,732\n=55,596.\n\nNow, the crowd at Victoria Park was 41,312. So comparing 55,596 (Kardinia + MCG) to 41,312 (Victoria Park). Since 55k is more than 41k, that would mean that Kardinia and MCG combined had a larger crowd than Victoria Park.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the game at Victoria Park have a larger crowd than the combined crowd of Kardinia Park and MCG.\" So according to my calculation, it's false because Victoria Park's 41k is less than the sum of 55k.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers. Maybe I made an addition error. Let me add 17864 + 37732 again:\n\n17864\n+37732\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 + 2 = 6.\n6 +3 =9.\n8 +7=15 (carry over 1).\n1 (from carry) + 7 (from MCG's tens place?) Wait, maybe I should write it out vertically:\n\n  17,864\n+37,732\n--------\nAdding the units: 4+2=6\nTens: 6+3=9\nHundreds:8+7=15. So we write down 5 and carry over 1.\nThousands:1 (from hundreds) + 7 (from thousands place of MCG) = 8, plus any carryover? Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's align the numbers properly.\n\n17,864 is\n1 7, 8 6 4\n\n37,732 is\n3 7, 7 3 2\n\nAdding them:\n\nStart from the right:\nUnits: 4 + 2 = 6.\nTens: 6 + 3 = 9.\nHundreds:8 + 7 =15. So write down 5, carryover 1.\nThousands place: 7 (from 17k) + 7 (from MCG's thousands place)=14, plus the carried 1 makes 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nTen-thousands place:1 (from MCG's ten-thousands) + nothing else? Wait no:\n\nWait, 17,864 is in the ten-thousands as 1 ten thousand, and 37,732 is 3 ten thousands.\n\nSo adding:\n1 (ten thousands) from 17,864\n+3 (ten thousands) from 37,732 =4 ten thousands.\nThen, next, the thousands place:7 from 17k +7 from MCG=14. So that's 14 thousand. But since we had a carryover of 1 earlier, wait no, the carryover is in the thousands addition.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to do it as:\n\n17,864\n+37,732 = \n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n17,864 + 30,000 =47,864\n\nThen add 7,732: 47,864 +7,732=55,596. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo total is 55,596. Victoria Park had 41,312. So the combined Kardinia and MCG crowds are larger than Victoria Park's.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the sum of Kardinia Park (17,864) and MCG (37,732) is 55,596 which is more than 41,312 at Victoria Park.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at Victoria Park was larger than the combined crowds of Kardinia Park and MCG. However, upon calculating, the sum of Kardinia Park's 17,864 and MCG's 37,732 attendees equals 55,596, which is indeed larger than Victoria Park's 41,312. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the game at junction oval have 2 time a larger crowd than at kardinia park.\" Hmm, first, I should make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns are home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. So for each game, we can see how many people attended by looking at the \"crowd\" column.\n\nThe claim is comparing two venues: junction oval and kardinia park. It's saying that there were two times a larger crowd at junction oval compared to kardinia park. Wait, does it mean twice as large? So, the crowd at junction oval was double that at kardinia park?\n\nFirst, I need to find the games played at both venues. Let me go through each row.\n\nStarting with the home teams:\n\n1. St Kilda vs South Melbourne at Moorabin Oval \u2013 crowd 16,205\n2. Melbourne vs Richmond at MCG \u2013 37,732\n3. Collingwood vs Hawthorn at Victoria Park \u2013 41,312\n4. Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park \u2013 17,864\n5. North Melbourne vs Essendon at Arden Street Oval \u2013 8,733\n6. Fitzroy vs Carlton at Junction Oval \u2013 22,413\n\nSo, junction oval is the venue for one game (row 6), and kardinia park is another venue (row 4). The claim is about comparing the crowds at these two venues across multiple games. Wait, but each venue only has one game in this table.\n\nWait, no. Looking again: junction oval is where Fitzroy played Carlton with a crowd of 22,413. Kardinia Park is where Geelong played Footscray with a crowd of 17,864.\n\nSo the claim is saying that for the game at junction oval, the crowd was twice as large as the crowd at kardinia park. So let's check if 22,413 is double 17,864.\n\nDouble of 17,864 would be 35,728. But in the table, the crowd at junction oval is 22,413, which is not double that of kardinia park (17,864). So the claim is false because 22,413 is less than double 17,864.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The claim says \"the game at junction oval have 2 time a larger crowd than at kardinia park.\" Does this mean that there were two games at junction oval where each was twice as large? Or does it refer to one game comparing the two venues?\n\nLooking back, perhaps I misinterpreted the claim. It could be that for each game at junction oval, the crowd was twice that of a corresponding game at kardinia park. But in this table, there's only one game at each venue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that the maximum crowd at junction oval was twice the maximum at kardinia park. Let me check: the highest crowd in the table is Collingwood vs Hawthorn with 41,312 at Victoria Park, but that's a different venue.\n\nWait, no, the claim specifically mentions junction oval and kardinia park. So it's comparing those two specific venues. In this case, the crowd at junction oval was 22,413, and at kardinia park, it was 17,864. 22,413 is larger than 17,864, but is it twice as large?\n\nLet me calculate: 17,864 multiplied by 2 equals 35,728. Since 22,413 is less than that, it's not double. So the claim is false because the crowd at junction oval wasn't twice as large as at kardinia park.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"have 2 time a larger crowd,\" which could be ambiguous. It might mean that there were two instances where the crowd at junction oval was larger by twice. But looking at the data, each venue only has one game in the table. So maybe it's comparing the single games at those venues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that for the same game, the away team at junction oval had a larger crowd than kardinia park. But no, each game is between different teams, so it's not the same game.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is straightforward: in the games at junction oval and kardinia park, the crowd at junction oval was twice as large as at kardinia park. Looking at the numbers, that's not true because 22k is less than double 17k.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2 times larger could mean more than double or exactly double? No, generally, \"twice as much\" means exactly double. So if it were double, then 22,413 would be 35,728, which isn't the case. So the claim is false because 22k isn't twice 17k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that there were two games at junction oval where each had a larger crowd than kardinia park. But in this table, there's only one game at junction oval and one at kardinia park. So maybe it's referring to multiple instances? Or perhaps it's a misstatement.\n\nWait, another angle: the claim could be saying that for two games at junction oval, each had a crowd twice as large as corresponding games at kardinia park. But again, in this table, there's only one game each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is stating that on average or something else, but the wording isn't clear on that. It just says \"the game\" which suggests it's referring to each specific game.\n\nBut looking back, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the numbers:\n\n- Junction oval: 22,413\n- Kardinia Park: 17,864\n\nIs 22,413 equal to twice 17,864? No, because 17,864 *2 is 35,728, which is more than 22k.\n\nSo the claim is false because the crowd at junction oval wasn't twice as large as kardinia park. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but wait again: maybe the claim is considering all games in the table and for each game at junction oval, check if any of them had a crowd twice that of a corresponding game at kardinia park. But since there's only one game at each, it's comparing 22k to 17k, which isn't double.\n\nSo yes, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at junction oval was twice as large as at kardinia park for a specific game. By examining the table, we find that the crowd figures are 22,413 and 17,864 respectively. Since 22,413 is not double 17,864, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- The row for Fitzroy vs Carlton at Junction Oval (row index 6) in the column \"crowd\".\n- The row for Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park (row index 5) in the column \"crowd\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
