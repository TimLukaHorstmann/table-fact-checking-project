    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"From CA Technical High School Joseph Barksdale be the heaviest player.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table lists various players with their details, including name, position, height, weight in pounds, and other info like where they were born, college, draft details, etc.\n\nI need to find out if Joseph Barksdale is from CA Technical High School and whether he's the heaviest player. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with the first few rows: Walter Clago, Darris McCord, Ben John Paolucci, Arnie Simkus, David Boone Jr., Aaron Kyle, Tom Seabron, Harlan Huckleby, Curtis Greer, Guy Frazier, Thomas Sidney Sims. None of these names are Joseph Barksdale, so I can skip them.\n\nThen, looking further down, the row for Joseph Barksdale is here: \n\n| joseph barksdale   | ot           | 6'4      |            325 | january 1 , 1989 detroit , mi   | lsu          | 2011 , r3 , p12  |\n\nSo his name is listed as \"joseph barksdale,\" born on January 1, 1989 in Detroit, MI. His college is LSU, and he was drafted in 2011.\n\nNow, the claim says he's from CA Technical High School. Looking at his 'born' column: it's specified as \"january 1 , 1989 detroit , mi.\" Detroit is in Michigan, not California. So he wasn't born in CA, so that part of the claim might be false.\n\nNext, is he the heaviest player? I need to check all players' weight. The 'weight (lbs)' column will tell me this.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Walter Clago: no info\n- Darris McCord: 250 lbs\n- Ben John Paolucci: 240 lbs\n- Arnie Simkus: 245 lbs\n- David Boone Jr.: 248 lbs\n- Aaron Kyle: 185 lbs\n- Tom Seabron: 215 lbs\n- Harlan Huckleby: 200 lbs\n- Curtis Greer: 256 lbs\n- Guy Frazier: 217 lbs\n- Thomas Sidney Sims: 288 lbs\n- Pat Ivey: 255 lbs\n- A J Ofodile: 260 lbs\n- Clarence Williams: 193 lbs\n- Vernon Gholston: 264 lbs\n- Joseph Barksdale: 325 lbs\n\nLooking at the weights, Joseph Barksdale is listed as 325 lbs. That's higher than others I've seen so far. Let me check if any other player has a higher weight.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- Thomas Sidney Sims: 288 lbs\n- A J Ofodile: 260 lbs\n- Vernon Gholston: 264 lbs\n- Joseph Barksdale: 325 lbs\n\nNo one else in the table exceeds 325 lbs. So Joseph is indeed the heaviest player listed.\n\nNow, back to his birthplace. The claim says CA Technical High School, but his birthplace is Detroit, MI. So that part is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. His 'born' entry: \"january 1 , 1989 detroit , mi.\" Yes, so he's from Michigan, not California.\n\nSo the claim has two parts: being from CA Technical High School and being the heaviest player.\n\nSince he's not from CA, that part is false. But he is the heaviest. So does the claim state both? The exact wording is: \"From CA Technical High School joseph barksdale be the heaviest player.\" \n\nSo it's making two claims about him: his high school and his weight.\n\nSince he wasn't born in CA, the first part is false, but if the claim was only about being the heaviest, it would be true. But since both parts are stated together, and one is false, the overall claim is false.\n\nBut wait, I need to clarify: the claim says \"from CA Technical High School joseph barksdale be the heaviest player.\" So it's a compound statement asserting two facts about him: that he's from that high school and that he's the heaviest. If either part is incorrect, the entire claim is false.\n\nTherefore, since he isn't from CA, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Joseph Barksdale is both from CA Technical High School and the heaviest player. However, his birthplace is Detroit, MI, making the first part of the claim false. Despite this, he is the heaviest at 325 lbs, but since the claim includes an incorrect statement about his high school, the entire claim is considered false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier both go to Wyoming College.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. Each row represents a different person with various attributes.\n\nStarting with Aaron Kyle:\n- His name is Aaron Kyle.\n- Looking for his college in the table, it's listed under the 'college' column. Scanning through each row, when I find Aaron Kyle, it says \"wyoming.\" So that part checks out.\n\nNow, checking Guy Frazier:\n- Name is Guy Frazier.\n- College is also mentioned; searching the table, it shows \"wyoming\" again for his college. So that's correct too.\n\nBoth individuals have their college listed as Wyoming in the table. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the 'college' column for both Aaron Kyle and Guy Frazier, which lists \"wyoming\" for each. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction. The claim says: \"from ca technical high school harlan huckleby be 1 inch taller then walter clago.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify the relevant cells in the table that relate to this claim. Let me look at the table columns again. We have name, position, height, weight, born, college, and drafted. The claim is about two people: Harlan Huckleby and Walter Clago. So I need to find their rows in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Walter Clago is the first entry, with a height of 6'0.\n- Harlan Huckleby is the eighth entry, also with a height listed as 6'1.\n\nWait, so Walter Clago's height is 6 feet 0 inches, and Harlan Huckleby is 6 feet 1 inch. That means Harlan is indeed 1 inch taller than Walter. \n\nNow, I should check if there's any condition that affects this. The claim mentions \"from ca technical high school,\" but looking at the table, neither Walter Clago nor Harlan Huckleby went to CA Technical High School. Walter was born in Detroit, MI, and Harlan also has his birthplace listed as Detroit, MI. So maybe the reference to CA tech is a mistake or irrelevant information.\n\nBut regardless of that, the main point is about their heights. Since Harlan is taller by 1 inch, the claim holds true. The college for Walter Clago is Detroit, and for Harlan, it's Michigan. So CA Technical High School doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the 'height' column for both Walter Clago (row_index:0) and Harlan Huckleby (row_index:7). There's no need to consider other columns like weight or born since the claim is about height.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Will Campbell be 1 of 6 students that go to Michigan college.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant information from the table. I'm focusing on Will Campbell's details. According to the table, Will Campbell is a player with position 'og' (offensive guard), height 6'4\", weight 311 lbs, born July 6, 1991 in Detroit, MI, and attended Michigan. He was drafted in 2013 as the 10th pick in round 6.\n\nThe claim mentions that Will Campbell is one of six students who go to Michigan college. Now, looking at the table, I need to find out how many players went to Michigan. The 'college' column lists each player's college. Let me scan through the list:\n\n1. Walter Clago - Detroit\n2. Darris McCord - Tennessee\n3. Ben John Paolucci - Wayne State\n4. Arnie Simkus - Michigan\n5. David Boone, Jr. - Eastern Michigan\n6. Aaron Kyle - Wyoming\n7. Tom Seabron - Michigan\n8. Harlan Huckleby - Michigan\n9. Curtis Greer - Michigan\n10. Guy Frazier - Wyoming\n11. Thomas Sidney Sims - Pittsburgh\n12. Pat Ivey - Missouri\n13. A.J. Ofodile - Missouri\n14. Clarence Williams - Michigan\n15. Vernon Gholston - Ohio State\n16. Joseph Barksdale - LSU\n17. Will Campbell - Michigan\n\nCounting the number of players who went to Michigan: Arnie Simkus, Tom Seabron, Harlan Huckleby, Curtis Greer, and Will Campbell. Wait, that's five so far. Clarence Williams is also listed as attending Michigan. So that makes six.\n\nSo there are six players from the table who attended Michigan. The claim says Will Campbell is one of those six.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table lists various individuals with their details, and the claim says there are 4 students who were undrafted from the \"CA Technical High School.\" \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Undrafted\" probably refers to not being selected in any draft, either as a rookie or in subsequent drafts. The term \"student\" is a bit vague but could mean someone enrolled in a high school, and \"CA Technical High School\" might be a specific school located in California.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row for players who were undrafted. Each row has several columns like name, position, height, weight, born, college, and drafted details. \n\nI'll go through each player one by one:\n\n1. Walter Clago: Undrafted.\n2. Darris McCord: Drafted in 1955, r3, p11.\n3. Ben John Paolucci: Undrafted.\n4. Arnie Simkus: Drafted in 1965, r6, p2.\n5. David Boone Jr.: Drafted in 1974, r11, p11.\n6.

From the table:\n\n- Walter Clago (row 0)\n- Ben John Paolucci (row 2)\n- Pat Ivey (row 11)\n- Clarence Williams (row 14)\n\nThat makes four undrafted players: Clago, Paolucci, Ivey, and Williams.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"from CA Technical High School.\" Looking at their 'born' column:\n\n- Walter Clago was born in Detroit, MI on June 9, 1899. No mention of CA.\n- Ben John Paolucci was born in Cleveland, OH on March 5, 1937. No CA.\n- Pat Ivey was born in Detroit, MI on December 27, 1972. No CA.\n- Clarence Williams was born in Detroit, MI on May 16, 1977. No CA.\n\nNone of these players were from CA Technical High School based on their birthplaces. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are only four undrafted players, but none of them attended CA Technical High School.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drafted\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drafted\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"drafted\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"drafted\"}\n]}",

The claim says: \"According to Cass Technical High School, Harlan Huckleby be 1 inch shorter than Walter Clago.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which players are involved here. Looking at the table, I see two players whose names might be relevant: Walter Clago and Harlan Huckleby.\n\nI'll locate their rows in the table to find their heights. Walter Clago is listed in row 0 with a height of 6'0\". Harlan Huckleby is in row 7 with a height of 6'1\".\n\nNext, I need to check if Harlan Huckleby's height is exactly 1 inch shorter than Walter Clago's. Walter is 6 feet tall, and Harlan is 6 feet 1 inch. The difference between them is 1 inch, so at first glance, the claim seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should also verify that both players are indeed associated with Cass Technical High School. Looking back at the table:\n\n- Walter Clago's \"born\" column shows he was born in Detroit, MI on June 30, 1899, but there's no explicit mention of his high school.\n- Harlan Huckleby is also born in Detroit, MI but on December 30, 1957. His college is listed as Michigan, and Cass Technical High School is mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince the claim attributes both players to Cass Technical High School, I need to check if Walter Clago attended that school. The table doesn't specify his high school, so this information isn't directly provided. Without confirmation of their association with Cass Tech, the claim might be based on an assumption not supported by the table.\n\nBut wait, the instruction is to check each condition against the table. Since both players are in the table and their heights are as stated, regardless of their high school affiliation, the height comparison stands. However, since the claim attributes this statement to Cass Tech High School, if that school didn't actually make such a comparison or it's not reflected in the table data, then the claim might be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't mention their high schools, so we can't confirm from the table whether Cass Tech is the source of that comparison. Therefore, without explicit information linking both players to Cass Tech High School and stating the height difference, the claim's basis isn't fully supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I compared the heights of Walter Clago (6'0\") and Harlan Huckleby (6'1\"). The height difference is 1 inch, which aligns with the claim. However, the table doesn't explicitly state that Cass Technical High School made this comparison or that both players attended there.

The claim mentions \"heaviest,\" so I'm looking at the \"weight (lbs)\" column. That's clear because weight is a key factor in determining a player's heaviness.\n\nNext, I need to find Joseph Barksdale's row in the table and note his weight. Scanning through the names, I see that Joseph Barksdale is listed towards the bottom of the table. His weight is 325 pounds as per the \"weight (lbs)\" column.\n\nNow, to verify if he's the third heaviest, I should look at all the other players' weights and rank them in descending order.

Walter Clago - weight is missing, but the \"born\" column indicates he's undrafted and older, so probably not in contention for top weights.\n17. Arnold Schwarzkopf - Wait, no, that's not on the table. Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, I think I missed a few. Let me list all players properly:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Walter Clago: 6'0\", weight missing\n- Darris McCord: 250 lbs\n- Ben John Paolucci: 240 lbs\n- Arnie Simkus: 245 lbs\n- David Boone, Jr.: 248 lbs\n- Aaron Kyle: 185 lbs\n- Tom Seabron: 215 lbs\n- Harlan Huckleby: 200 lbs\n- Curtis Greer: 256 lbs\n- Guy Frazier: 217 lbs\n- Thomas Sidney Sims: 288 lbs\n- Pat Ivey: 255 lbs\n- A.J.

Let me list all the weights properly:\n\n1. Walter Clago - weight not listed (195 lbs in one entry? Wait no, looking at the table again:\n\nWait, the \"weight\" column has values like 195 for Walter Clago, but let's check each row:\n\n- walter clago: weight is blank? Let me look back.\n\nYes, in the table, for walter clago, the weight cell is empty. So he doesn't have a listed weight. Therefore, his weight isn't provided, so we can't consider him in the ranking.\n\nSo the players with weight data are:\n\n- Darris McCord: 250\n- Ben John Paolucci: 240\n- Arnie Simkus: 245\n- David Boone, Jr.: 248\n- Tom Seabron: 215\n- Harlan Huckleby: 200\n- Curtis Greer: 256\n- Guy Frazier: 217\n- Thomas Sidney Sims: 288\n- Pat Ivey: 255\n- A.J. Ofodile: 260\n- Clarence Williams: 193\n- Vernon Gholston: 264\n- Joseph Barksdale: 325\n- Will Campbell: 311\n\nNow, let's list them in descending order:\n\n1. Thomas Sidney Sims - 288 lbs\n2. Joseph Barksdale - 325? Wait no, 325 is higher than 288. So correction:\n\nWait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me sort correctly.\n\nThe highest weight is Joseph Barksdale at 325, then:\n\n- Will Campbell: 311\n- Thomas Sidney Sims: 288\n- Vernon Gholston: 264\n- A.J. Ofodile: 260\n- Darris McCord: 250\n- David Boone, Jr.: 248\n- Arnie Simkus: 245\n- Ben John Paolucci: 240\n- Curtis Greer: 256\n- Pat Ivey: 255\n- Guy Frazier: 217\n- Tom Seabron: 215\n- Harlan Huckleby: 200\n- Clarence Williams: 193\n\nWait, but Joseph Barksdale is 325, which is higher than all others. So he's the heaviest.\n\nBut wait, in the initial listing, I thought Thomas Sidney Sims was 288, but Joseph Barksdale is 325, so he's actually first. However, the claim says \"third heaviest,\" which would mean there are two players heavier than him.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n1. Joseph Barksdale - 325\n2. Will Campbell - 311\n3. Thomas Sidney Sims - 288\n\nWait no, because 325 is higher than 311 and 288. So if we're considering third heaviest, it would be after the top two: Joseph (1), Will (2), Thomas (3). But actually, that's not correct because 325 is highest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table. Let me double-check each player's weight:\n\n- Walter Clago: no weight\n- Darris McCord: 250\n- Ben John Paolucci: 240\n- Arnie Simkus: 245\n- David Boone, Jr.: 248\n- Aaron Kyle: 185\n- Tom Seabron: 215\n- Harlan Huckleby: 200\n- Curtis Greer: 256\n- Guy Frazier: 217\n- Thomas Sidney Sims: 288\n- Pat Ivey: 255\n- A.J. Ofodile: 260\n- Clarence Williams: 193\n- Vernon Gholston: 264\n- Joseph Barksdale: 325\n- Will Campbell: 311\n\nSo the weights in order from highest to lowest:\n\n1. Joseph Barksdale - 325\n2. Will Campbell - 311\n3. Thomas Sidney Sims - 288\n4. Vernon Gholston - 264\n5. A.J. Ofodile - 260\n6. Darris McCord - 250\n7. David Boone, Jr. - 248\n8. Arnie Simkus - 245\n9. Ben John Paolucci - 240\n10. Curtis Greer - 256\n11. Pat Ivey - 255\n12. Tom Seabron - 215\n13. Guy Frazier - 217\n14. Harlan Huckleby - 200\n15. Clarence Williams - 193\n\nWait, but in this list, Joseph Barksdale is first, so he's the heaviest, not third. Therefore, the claim that he's third is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"third heaviest.\" If someone else has a higher weight than him, but he's third after two others. But since his weight is 325, which is higher than all except Will Campbell (311) and Thomas Sims (288), he is actually the heaviest, not third.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are players with weights above him that I missed. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Darris McCord is 250, Ben Paolucci 240, Arnie Simkus 245, David Boone 248, Aaron Kyle 185, Tom Seabron 215, Harlan Huckleby 200, Curtis Greer 256, Guy Frazier 217, Thomas Sims 288, Pat Ivey 255, A.J. Ofodile 260, Vernon Gholston 264, Joseph Barksdale 325, Will Campbell 311.\n\nSo yes, the top three are:\n\n1. Joseph Barksdale - 325\n2. Will Campbell - 311\n3. Thomas Sidney Sims - 288\n\nWait no, because 325 is higher than all others, so Joseph is first, then Will (311), then Thomas (288). So Joseph is the heaviest, not third.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Joseph Barksdale is the third heaviest according to Cass Technical High School is false. He's actually the heaviest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table has a different weight for him or I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Joseph Barksdale's row: \"Joseph Barksdale - 325 lbs\" yes, that's correct. So he's the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect; he's not third but first.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Joseph Barksdale is the third heaviest player according to Cass Technical High School is false. Based on the weight data provided in the table, Joseph Barksdale has a weight of 325 lbs, which makes him the heaviest player, not the third. Therefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect; Joseph Barksdale is the heaviest, not the third heaviest.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Players and Weights:** List all players and their respective weights from the provided table.\n2. **Sort by Weight:** Arrange the players in descending order based on their recorded weights.\n3. **Determine Ranking:** Identify the top three positions after sorting.\n4. **Analyze the Claim:** Compare the claim with the obtained ranking to assess its accuracy.\n\nUpon analysis, it's clear that Joseph Barksdale holds the highest weight, making him the heaviest player rather than the third. Hence, the original claim is incorrect.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus be 2 of 6 students that go to Michigan college.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. Let me find the rows for Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus.\n\nStarting with Will Campbell: Scanning down the 'name' column, I see his row towards the end. His name is \"will campbell,\" and looking at his college, it's listed as \"michigan.\" So he attended Michigan.\n\nNext, checking Arnie Simkus: His name is \"arnie simkus,\" and his college is also \"michigan.\" So both Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus went to Michigan.\n\nNow, the claim mentions that there are 6 students total. I need to see if these two are among those six who attended Michigan. Let me look at the table to find all players who went to Michigan.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Walter Clago - College: Detroit\n2. Darris McCord - Tennessee\n3. Ben John Paolucci - Wayne State\n4. Arnie Simkus - Michigan\n5. David Boone, Jr. - Eastern Michigan\n6. Aaron Kyle - Wyoming\n7. Tom Seabron - Michigan\n8. Harlan Huckleby - Michigan\n9. Curtis Greer - Michigan\n10. Guy Frazier - Wyoming\n11. Thomas Sidney Sims - Pittsburgh\n12. Pat Ivey - Mizzou\n13. A J Ofodile - Mizzou\n14. Clarence Williams - Undrafted, so no college.\n15. Vernon Gholston - Ohio State\n16. Joseph Barksdale - LSU\n17. Will Campbell - Michigan\n\nFrom this list, the players who went to Michigan are: Arnie Simkus, Tom Seabron, Harlan Huckleby, Curtis Greer, and Will Campbell. Wait, that's five players so far. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the table shows:\n\n- arnie simkus: michigan\n- tom seabron: michigan\n- harlan huckleby: michigan\n- curtis greer: michigan\n- will campbell: michigan\n\nThat's five players. Did I miss any?\n\nLooking again at each player:\n\nwalter clago - detroit, no\ndarris mccord - tennessee, no\nben john paolucci - wayne state, no\narnie simkus - michigan (1)\ndavid boone - eastern mich, no\naaron kyle - wyoming, no\ntom seabron - michigan (2)\nharlan huckleby - michigan (3)\ncurtis greer - michigan (4)\nguy frazier - wyoming, no\nthomas sims - pittsburgh, no\npat ivey - mizzou, no\na j ofodile - mizzou, no\nclarence williams - undrafted\nvernon gholston - ohio state, no\njoseph barksdale - lsu, no\nwill campbell - michigan (5)\n\nSo total of five Michigan college players. The claim says \"2 of 6 students.\" So it's not accurate because only two out of the 17 listed went to Michigan, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I think I misread the table.\n\nWait no, the claim is about being part of a group of 6 who attend Michigan. But according to the table, more than two attended Michigan\u2014specifically, five players: Arnie Simkus, Tom Seabron, Harlan Huckleby, Curtis Greer, and Will Campbell. So if the claim says \"2 of 6,\" that's incorrect because there are more than two.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim might be referring to a specific group or draft class. Alternatively, perhaps the table only includes certain years or players, but from what is given, the count is five. So the claim's assertion that \"Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus be 2 of 6 students\" is false because there are more than two Michigan students\u2014specifically five\u2014and not just a group of six with exactly two being them.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"2 of 6 students that go to Michigan.\" So if only two went, then it's true. But in reality, five did, so the claim is false because they are part of a larger group.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check how many players attended Michigan college and whether Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus are among them.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players**:\n   - **Will Campbell**: College listed as \"michigan.\"\n   - **Arnie Simkus**: College also listed as \"michigan.\"\n\n2. **Count Total Michigan Attendees**:\n   From the table, five players attended Michigan college: Arnie Simkus, Tom Seabron, Harlan Huckleby, Curtis Greer, and Will Campbell.\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   The claim states that they are \"2 of 6 students.\" However, since there are actually five Michigan attendees, including both individuals mentioned, this assertion is incorrect because more than two attended.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is false as there are more than two Michigan attendees listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Statement\": \"Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus be 2 of 6 students that go to Michigan college.\",\n  \"Verification\": {\n    \"Will Campbell\": {\n      \"College\": \"michigan\"\n    },\n    \"Arnie Simkus\": {\n      \"College\": \"michigan\"\n    },\n    \"Total Michigan Attendees\": 5\n  },\n  \"Conclusion\": \"False. There are five students who attended Michigan college, including Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus.\"\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be 16 students that be draft through CA Technical High School\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: name, position, height, weight (lbs), born, college, and drafted. The claim mentions \"CA Technical High School,\" which isn't directly a column in the table. So, my first thought is to check if any of the students listed attended CA Technical High School.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Walter Clago - Born in Detroit, MI, went to Detroit College.\n2. Darris McCord - Born in Detroit, MI, from Tennessee.\n3. Ben John Paolucci - From Cleveland, OH, went to Wayne State.\n4. Arnie Simkus - Born in Schlava, GER, went to Michigan.\n5. David Boone Jr. - From Detroit, MI, Eastern Michigan.\n6. Aaron Kyle - From Wyoming.\n7. Tom Seabron - From Baltimore, MD, Michigan.\n8. Harlan Huckleby - From Michigan.\n9. Curtis Greer - From Michigan.\n10. Guy Frazier - From Wyoming.\n11. Thomas Sidney Sims - From Pittsburgh, went to Pittsburg (probably a typo for Pittsburgh State?).\n12. Pat Ivey - From Mizzou.\n13. A.J. Ofodile - From Mizzou.\n14. Clarence Williams - From Michigan.\n15. Vernon Gholston - From Ohio State.\n16. Joseph Barksdale - From LSU.\n17. Will Campbell - From Michigan.\n\nLooking at the 'college' column, none of the colleges listed are CA Technical High School. The closest is maybe \"Wayne State\" or \"Michigan,\" but those aren't CA schools either. The claim mentions \"CA Technical High School,\" which I assume is in California.\n\nNext, the claim refers to \"students that be draft.\" In the table, the 'drafted' column shows whether they were drafted and their draft details. So, are any of these 17 students from CA Technical High School who got drafted?\n\nSince none of the colleges match CA Technical, it's unlikely there are any relevant cells. But let me check each row's 'born' location for Detroit, MI, as that's where CA Technical might be located. However, being born in Detroit doesn't mean they went to CA Technical.\n\nLooking at the 'college' column again: all colleges listed are either universities or other states, not CA Technical High School. So none of these 17 students attended CA Technical High School.\n\nTherefore, there are no relevant cells that support the claim because the table doesn't mention any student from that school who was drafted.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
