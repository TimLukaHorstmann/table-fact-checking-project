    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless in four games. So, I need to check if there are four games where the opponent's points (opponents column) are zero.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns include game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and record. My focus here is on the \"opponents\" column because that's where the score of the opposing team is listed.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. **Game 1**: Opponents scored 14 points. So, they were not scoreless.\n2. **Game 2**: Opponents scored 0 points. That's one game where they were scoreless.\n3. **Game 3**: Opponents scored 7 points. Not scoreless.\n4. **Game 4**: Opponents scored 0 points. That's the second game where they were scoreless.\n5. **Game 5**: Opponents scored 0 points. Third game.\n6. **Game 6**: Opponents scored 6 points. Not scoreless.\n7. **Game 7**: Opponents scored 13 points. Not scoreless.\n8. **Game 8**: Opponents scored 6 points. Not scoreless.\n9. **Game 9**: Opponents scored 0 points. Fourth game where they were scoreless.\n10. **Game 10**: Opponents scored 13 points. Not scoreless.\n\nSo, the games where opponents are scoreless are Game 2, 4, 5, and 9. That's four games in total. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on these four instances.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any other interpretation. The term \"keep the oppose team scoreless\" might imply that in all those four games, the Wildcats never allowed points. But from the table, it looks like they did allow points in some of those games. For example, Game 4: Wildcats scored 26, opponents scored 0. So, yes, but the claim is specifically about keeping them scoreless, which aligns with that.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the table, I notice something odd. In Game 4, under \"record\", it says \"3 - 1 , 20\". That seems out of place, perhaps a formatting issue. But since the opponents' points are correctly listed as 0 in that game, maybe that's just part of the record entry and not affecting the current analysis.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there exactly four games where opponents scored 0? From my count earlier, yes\u2014Game 2,4,5,9. So that's four games where opponents were scoreless.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because in four games, the Wildcats kept their opponents' scores at zero.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcats never score more than 7 in any game they lose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this claim are:\n\n1. **game**: Each game has a unique number.\n2. **date**: Not directly relevant to scoring.\n3. **opponent**: Not directly relevant unless it affects performance, but I think the opponent's name isn't directly tied to the score.\n4. **result**: This is crucial because we're interested in games where the Wildcats lost (result = loss).\n5. **wildcats points**: This is what we need to compare against 7.\n6. **opponents points**: Not relevant for the Wildcats' points.\n7. **record**: Also not directly relevant; it's more about their overall performance, but maybe useful in some cases.\n\nThe claim specifies that in any game they lose, the Wildcats never scored more than 7 points. So I need to check all games where the result is \"loss\" and see if their points exceed 7.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: game 1, sept 20 vs ole miss, loss. Wildcat points: 7.\n- **Row 6**: game 10, nov 22 vs tennessee, loss. Wildcat points: 6.\nWait, the table might have a different structure; looking again, it's better to check each row where the result is \"loss.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\n1. Game 1 (sept 20): Wildcats lost with 7 points.\n2. Game 7 (nov 1): Wildcats lost with 0 points.\n3. Game 10 (nov 22): Wildcats lost with 6 points.\n\nLooking at these, in all loss games, their points are 7, 0, and 6. None of them exceed 7. The highest is exactly 7.\n\nWait a second\u2014let me check again because sometimes markdown tables can be tricky. The user mentioned the table, so I'll map it correctly:\n\nRows where result is \"loss\":\n- Row 0: Wildcats score 7.\n- Row 6: Wildcats score 6.\n\nSo in both cases, they don't exceed 7. Therefore, the claim holds true as they never scored more than 7 in any loss.\n\nWait another point\u2014maybe I miscounted rows. Let me list all games:\n\n1. Loss: 7 points.\n2. Win: 20.\n3. Win: 20.\n4. Win: 26.\n5. Win:14.\n6. Win:7.\n7. Loss:0.\n8. Win:15.\n9. Win:36.\n10. Loss:6.\n\nSo yes, in loss games (1 and 7), their points are 7 and 0, which are both \u22647.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because they never scored more than 7 in any loss game.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the wildcat lose 1 game in september and 2 games in november.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Wildcats lost 1 game in September.\n2. Wildcats lost 2 games in November.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to check these points.\n\nLooking at the first part: loss in September. The 'date' column is key here. The games are numbered from 1 to 10. Game 1 is on Sept 20, which is a loss. So that's one loss in September. That checks out.\n\nNow, for November losses. Let me check all November games:\n- Game 7: Nov 1, lost.\n- Game 8: Nov 8, won.\n- Game 9: Nov 15, won.\n- Game 10: Nov 22, lost.\n\nSo in November, there are two losses (games 7 and 10). That's two losses, which matches the claim. \n\nWait, but let me double-check if the dates are correctly mapped to September and November. Yes, game 1 is Sept 20, so that's September. Games 7,8,9,10 are in November.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported based on the table data.

The claim states: \"the wildcat play 2 game in september , 4 game in october , and 4 game in november.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to be talking about how many games the Wildcats played in each month\u2014September, October, November. The table has a column for 'date', which indicates when each game was played. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with the following columns: game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats points, opponents points, and record. So, to check how many games they played in each month, I need to look at the 'date' column for September, October, and November.\n\nStarting with September: The table lists the dates as \"sept 20\" and \"sept 27\". That's two games in September. \n\nNext, October: The dates are oct 4, oct 11, oct 18, and oct 25. That's four games in October. \n\nThen, November: The dates are nov 1, nov 8, nov 15, and nov 22. Wait, that's four games as well, right? Let me count again\u2014each game is a separate row, so November has four games.\n\nSo the claim says they played 2 in September (which matches), 4 in October (matches), and 4 in November (which also matches).

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the most the wildcats outscore an opponent by 36 points.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each game in the table and see when the Wildcats scored the most against their opponents. Each row has a \"wildcats points\" column which indicates the points the Wildcats scored in that game.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Wildcats scored 7 points. Opponents scored 14. So the outscore is 7 - 14 = -7 (Wildcats were outscored).\n2. Game 2: 20 points vs 0. Outscore of +20.\n3. Game 3: 20 vs 7, so +13.\n4. Game 4: 26 vs 0, +26.\n5. Game 5: 14 vs 0, +14.\n6. Game 6: 7 vs 6, +1.\n7. Game 7: 0 vs 13, -13.\n8. Game 8: 15 vs 6, +9.\n9. Game 9: 36 vs 0, +36.\n10. Game 10: 6 vs 13, -7.\n\nFrom this, the highest outscore by Wildcats is in Game 9, where they scored 36 points against Evansville. The difference is 36-0=+36. \n\nThe claim says \"the most the wildcats outscore an opponent by 36 point.\" It's looking for whether the maximum outscore is at least 36.\n\nLooking at the data, yes, Game 9 shows a +36, which is exactly 36 points. So this supports the claim.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells in the table that confirm this. The columns involved are \"game,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"result,\" and importantly, \"wildcats points.\" Specifically, for each game where Wildcats scored at least 36, but here it's only Game 9.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, Game 9 has Wildcats points as 36. So, the relevant cells would be for that specific game: row index 8 (since counting starts from 0?), wait no. Let me check:\n\nThe table lists games from 1 to 10, so row_index starts at 0 for game 1 up to 9 for game 10.\n\nSo Game 9 is row_index 8? Wait, let me count: \n\nRow 0: Game 1\n\nRow 1: Game 2\n\n...\n\nRow 8: Game 9 (since 8+1=9). So yes, row index 8, column_name \"wildcats points\" and probably \"opponent.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are where Wildcats scored 36. Only in game 9, so the row_index is 8 and column is \"wildcats points.\" Also, perhaps opponent's name to confirm it's Evansville.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the most they outscore an opponent by 36 points,\" but does it specify against whom? It doesn't, so as long as in any game, Wildcats scored 36 more than their opponent, which they did in Game 9. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 8 (game 9), \"wildcats points\" column.\n\nI think that's all. The other games don't reach 36. So the only relevant cell is where Wildcats scored 36.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Wildcats' performance in Game 9, where they outscored their opponent by 36 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It's about Wildcats keeping their opponents scoreless in 10 games. So, I need to check each of these 10 games and see if the Wildcats won without allowing any points from the opponent.\n\nLooking at the table, there are columns like game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and record. The relevant information here is the \"opponent\" and \"result\" columns because they show who the opponent was and whether the Wildcats won or lost each game.\n\nI'll go through each of the 10 games:\n\n1. Game 1: Opponent is Ole Miss, result is loss. So, Wildcats didn't win this one.\n2. Game 2: Opponent is Cincinnati, result is win. Now, check the points: Wildcats scored 20, opponents 0. So yes, opponents were scoreless here.\n3. Game 3: Xavier, result is win. Wildcats 20, opponents 7. Opponents scored, so this doesn't count.\n4. Game 4: 9 Georgia, win. Wildcats 26, opponents 0. Scoreless again.\n5. Game 5: 10 Vanderbilt, win. Wildcats 14, opponents 0. Scoreless.\n6. Game 6: Michigan State, win. Wildcats 7, opponents 6. Opponents scored, so no.\n7. Game 7: 18 Alabama, loss. So not a win, doesn't count.\n8. Game 8: West Virginia, win. Wildcats 15, opponents 6. Opponents scored.\n9. Game 9: Evansville, win. Wildcats 36, opponents 0. Scoreless.\n10. Game 10: Tennessee, loss. Doesn't count.\n\nNow, from the 10 games, in which ones did the Wildcats win and keep their opponents scoreless? Looking back:\n\n- Game 2: Win, opponents scoreless.\n- Game 4: Win, opponents scoreless.\n- Game 5: Win, opponents scoreless.\n- Game 9: Win, opponents scoreless.\n\nSo that's four games where Wildcats won and kept the opponent scoreless. The claim says \"in 10 game,\" which I think means in all 10 games, but clearly, there are more than just Wildcats winning; they also lost some games. So the statement is not accurate as it implies that in all 10 games, opponents were scoreless when Wildcats won, but actually, only four of those ten resulted in a win with no points for the opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. It says \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game.\" Maybe it's saying that they kept them scoreless across 10 games, not necessarily all of them being wins. So maybe it's about having 10 instances where opponents were kept scoreless.\n\nLooking back at the table, how many times did Wildcats win with opponent points as zero? Let me recount:\n\n- Game 2: Opponent 0\n- Game 4: Opponent 0\n- Game 5: Opponent 0\n- Game 9: Opponent 0\n\nThat's four games. So the claim says \"in 10 game,\" which might be a typo or misunderstanding, but if it's about keeping opponents scoreless in any of their games, then 4 is correct. But if it's claiming that in each of the 10 games they played, the opponent was kept scoreless, which isn't true because in six games they lost and likely allowed points.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim might be saying that Wildcats have kept their opponents scoreless in ten different games. So how many times did they win while keeping opponents scoreless? That's four. But the claim says \"in 10 game,\" which could mean across ten games. Or perhaps it's a translation issue, and it means that they kept the opponents scoreless across ten of their games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to all ten games being instances where they kept the opponent scoreless, but that's not true because in some games, like game 3, opponents scored even though Wildcats won. So no, that's incorrect.\n\nI think the key is that the claim says \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game.\" So for each of those ten games, when they played, their opponent was kept scoreless. But looking at each game:\n\n- Game 1: loss, so opponent might have scored.\n- Game 2: win, opponents 0.\n- Game 3: win but opponents scored.\n- Game 4: win, opponents 0.\n- Game 5: win, opponents 0.\n- Game 6: win but opponents scored.\n- Game 7: loss, so probably opponents scored.\n- Game 8: win but opponents scored.\n- Game 9: win, opponents 0.\n- Game 10: loss.\n\nSo in games 2,4,5,9 they won with opponent scoring zero. The other wins (3,6,8) had opponents scoring, and the losses probably allowed more points for the opponents. So only four instances where they kept opponents scoreless, not ten. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not true that in all ten games they played, their opponents were kept scoreless.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim meant that in some ten games, they did that, then it would be partially correct but still false since it's not exactly ten times.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the Wildcats didn't keep all ten opponents scoreless. They only did so in four of their games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking each game to see if the Wildcats won with the opponent scoring zero. Only four such instances are found, not ten. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 point in any game they win\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. There are multiple columns: game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats points, opponents, and record. The claim specifically refers to the Wildcats' scoring in games they won. So, my focus should be on the rows where the result is a win.\n\nI should go through each row one by one, check if it's a win, and then note down the Wildcats' points for those games. \n\nStarting with Game 1: The result is a loss, so I can skip this. Game 2: They won with 20 points. That's already above 7, which would indicate the claim is false. But let me check all relevant games to be thorough.\n\nGame 3: Win with 20 points. Again, that's more than 7.\nGame 4: Win with 26 points\u2014definitely over.\nGame 5: Win with 14 points. Still above 7.\nGame 6: Win with 7 points. Exactly at the limit mentioned.\nGame 7: Loss, skip.\nGame 8: Win with 15 points. More than 7.\nGame 9: Win with 36 points. Well above.\nGame 10: Loss.\n\nSo, looking at all the wins (Games 2,3,4,5,6,8,9), I see that in Game 6 they scored exactly 7 points, which is the threshold. But the claim says \"never score more than 7,\" implying they never went above. However, in other games like Games 2,3,4,5,8,9, their points were higher than 7. Therefore, the claim is false because they scored more than 7 in those games.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any rows or misread the data.

So the claim is false because in many games they won, they scored more than 7 points.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and I need to identify all relevant cells where Wildcats' points in wins exceed 7.\n</think>\n\nThe Wildcats scored more than 7 points in multiple games they won, such as Game 2 (20), Game3 (20), Game4 (26), Game5 (14), Game8 (15), and Game9 (36).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 games in september.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant columns in the table. The key points are about when the Wildcats lost games. Looking at the table, there's a column for 'date' and 'result.' So I need to check which games resulted in losses.\n\nNow, let me go through each game one by one. \n\nStarting with September:\n- Game 1 on Sept 20: Result is loss. That's one loss.\n- Game 2 on Sept 27: Result is win.\nSo in September, there's only one loss.\n\nNext, November:\n- Game 7 on Nov 1: Result is loss. That's the first November loss.\n- Game 8 on Nov 8: Win.\n- Game 9 on Nov 15: Win.\n- Game 10 on Nov 22: Loss. So that's another loss in November.\n\nWait, but the claim says they lost 1 game in November and 2 games in September. From my check, they only lost one game in November (game 7 and 10). But in September, there was only one loss as well (game 1). \n\nSo the claim is saying Wildcats lost 1 in November and 2 in September. However, according to the table, it's 1 loss in November and 1 loss in September. That doesn't match the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Wildcats lost one game in November and two games in September. Reviewing the table:\n\n- **September Losses**: Only Game 1 resulted in a loss.\n- **November Losses**: Games 7 and 10 resulted in losses (two games).\n\nThis contradicts the claim's assertion of two September losses, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the most the wildcats outscore an opponent by 26 points\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should look through each game in the table and see where the Wildcats scored 26 points against an opponent. The goal is to find if there's a game where they outscored their opponent by 26 points. If such a game exists, then the claim would be TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the \"wildcats points\" column in each row:\n\nRow 1: Wildcats scored 7 points against Ole Miss (loss). The opponent scored 14, so Wildcats were outscored by 7.\nRow 2: They won with 20 points vs Cincinnati who scored 0. So they outscored by 20.\nRow 3: Won with 20 against Xavier who scored 7. Outscored by 13.\nRow 4: Won with 26 against Georgia, and the opponent scored 0. That's a significant lead of 26 points.\nRow 5: Scored 14 against Vanderbilt (who scored 0). So outscored by 14.\nRow 6: Scored 7 vs Michigan State who had 6. Outscored by 1.\nRow 7: Lost with 0 to Alabama, so opponent outscored them.\nRow 8: Won with 15 against West Virginia, who scored 6. So Wildcats outscored by 9.\nRow 9: Scored 36 against Evansville (who scored 0). Outscored by 36.\nRow 10: Lost with 6 to Tennessee, so opponent won.\n\nSo in row 4, the Wildcats scored 26 points more than their opponent. Therefore, this game meets the criteria of outscoring an opponent by 26 points.\n\nI should make sure that no other rows have a higher score difference, but 26 is already the highest here. So the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat play 4 game in september , 2 game in october , and 2 game in november\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions three months: September, October, and November. For each month, it specifies how many games the Wildcats played: 4 in September, 2 in October, and 2 in November.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the \"game\" column has numbers from 1 to 10, each with a corresponding date and other details. The key columns here are \"date,\" which indicates when each game was played, and \"result,\" but more importantly, we need to count how many games were played in each month.\n\nI'll start by listing out the games and categorizing them by month:\n\n- **September:**\n  - Game 1 on Sept 20\n  - Game 2 on Sept 27\n\nThat's two games in September. But the claim says there were 4 games in September, which doesn't match. So this part is incorrect.\n\n- **October:**\n  - Games 3 and 4 are on Oct 4 and Oct 11.\n  - Games 5 and 6 are on Oct 18 and Oct 25.\n\nThat's four games in October. The claim states there were 2 games, which is wrong here too.\n\n- **November:**\n  - Games 7, 8, 9, and 10 are spread across Nov 1, Nov 8, Nov 15, and Nov 22.\n  \nSo that's four games in November. The claim claims only 2 games, so this also doesn't align.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"the wildcat play 4 game in september , 2 game in october , and 2 game in november.\" But from the table:\n\n- September: 2 games\n- October: 4 games\n- November: 4 games\n\nSo all three parts of the claim are incorrect. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim is about the number of games per month, I need to check each game's date to see which month it falls into and count accordingly. Each row has a \"date\" which tells us the month. So for each row, if the date is September, October, or November, we can include those cells in relevant_cells.\n\nBut wait, the table uses abbreviations like \"sept 20,\" so I need to parse the months correctly. Let's check:\n\n- Game 1: sept 20 \u2192 September\n- Game 2: sept 27 \u2192 September\n- Games 3 and 4: oct 4 and oct 11 \u2192 October\n- Games 5 and 6: oct 18 and oct 25 \u2192 October\n- Games 7,8,9,10: nov 1, 8,15,22 \u2192 November\n\nSo games in September: rows 0 and 1 (assuming row indices start at 0). But the claim says 4 games, so we need to note these as relevant.\n\nGames in October: rows 2-5. The claim mentions only 2 games here, but there are 4, so all of them should be considered for checking.\n\nGames in November: rows 6-9. The claim claims 2 games, but it's actually 4, so again, these are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include all the September, October, and November games because each contributes to either disproving the number of games per month as claimed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the Wildcats played 2 games in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November, not the numbers stated. All September, October, and November games are relevant.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
