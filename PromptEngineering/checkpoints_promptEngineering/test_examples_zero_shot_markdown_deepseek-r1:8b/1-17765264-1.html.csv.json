    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 14489.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The record refers to the team's overall performance during the season, probably win-loss-tie format. The attendance is about how many people attended that particular game.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different game with its details.\n\nThe claim specifies two conditions:\n1. The record should be 4 - 4.\n2. The attendance for that game is 14489.\n\nSo I need to find if there's a game where both these conditions are met.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table and check these two points.\n\nStarting from week 1, the first game:\n- Week: 1\n- Opponent: Boston Patriots\n- Result: Win 13-10\n- Attendance: 21597\nRecord is 1 - 0. So attendance isn't 14489, so not relevant here.\n\nWeek 2:\n- Opponent: Buffalo Bills\n- Result: Win 27-21\n- Attendance: 15229\nRecord 2 - 0. Not matching.\n\nWeek 3:\n- Opponent: New York Titans\n- Result: Loss 24-28\n- Attendance: 20462\nRecord 2 - 1. No match.\n\nWeek 4:\n- Opponent: Oakland Raiders\n- Win 31-14\n- Attendance: 18372\nRecord 3 - 1. Not the right attendance or record.\n\nSkipping to week 6, because weeks are numbered up to 14 but some weeks might be skipped. Wait, the table has week numbers from 1 to 14, but not all consecutive? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the table again, it starts at week 1 and goes up by week each time, except that week 5 is missing. So perhaps week 6 comes after week 4, meaning there's a week 5 gap, which isn't listed here. But the table continues with weeks 6 to 14.\n\nSo I need to check each row as per their order regardless of consecutive numbering.\n\nWeek 6:\n- Opponent: Los Angeles Chargers\n- Result: Loss 19-23\n- Attendance: 19141\nRecord is 3 - 2. Not matching.\n\nWeek 7:\n- Opponent: Boston Patriots\n- Win 31-24\n- Attendance: 12683\nRecord 4 - 2. Close on the record, but attendance is lower than 14489.\n\nWait, the claim says \"attendance at the game be 14489.\" So I need to find a row where the attendance column equals 14489 and the record is 4 - 4.\n\nLooking further:\n\nWeek 9:\n- Opponent: Houston Oilers\n- Result: Loss 25-45\n- Attendance: 14489\nRecord 4 - 4. Oh, this seems to fit both conditions! So in week 9, attendance was 14489 and the record at that point was 4 - 4.\n\nWait, but let me check if it's indeed 4 - 4. The previous game (week 8) resulted in a loss, making the record 4 - 3 before week 9. So week 9 would be after that.\n\nYes, so by week 9, their record is 4 - 4 because they lost that game as well? Wait no, if it's a win or loss, the record increments accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to track the record properly. Let me list out each week's result and update the record accordingly.\n\nLet's see:\n\nWeek 1: Win \u2192 Record becomes 1 - 0\nWeek 2: Win \u2192 2 - 0\nWeek 3: Loss \u2192 2 - 1\nWeek 4: Win \u2192 3 - 1\nWeek 6: Loss \u2192 3 - 2\nWeek 7: Win \u2192 4 - 2\nWeek 8: Loss \u2192 4 - 3\nWeek 9: Loss \u2192 4 - 4 (because it's the fourth loss)\nSo yes, by week 9, their record is 4 - 4.\n\nTherefore, in that week, both conditions are met: attendance of 14489 and a record of 4 - 4. So the claim should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are for week 9.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where, on week 9 with an attendance of 14,489, the team's record was 4 - 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on this table. The claim says, \"the game on November 13, 1960 was held at the Cotton Bowl site.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. It's in markdown format with several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nI should start by searching for a row where the date is November 13, 1960. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nWeek 1: September 9, 1960 \u2013 not November.\nWeek 2: September 18, 1960 \u2013 still early.\nWeek 3: September 23, 1960 \u2013 nope.\nWeek 4: October 2, 1960 \u2013 no.\nWeek 6: October 16, 1960 \u2013 not there yet.\nWeek 7: October 23, 1960 \u2013 still October.\nWeek 8: October 30, 1960 \u2013 end of October.\nWeek 9: November 6, 1960 \u2013 getting closer but not the 13th.\nWeek 10: November 13, 1960 \u2013 yes, this is the date we're looking for.\n\nSo the relevant row is week 10. Now I need to check what the game site was for that particular game. According to the table, on November 13, 1960, the opponent was the Dallas Texans, and the result was a loss with the score 7-34. The game site is listed as \"cotton bowl.\"\n\nWait, but sometimes dates can be tricky because weeks are numbered, but the actual date might vary. For example, week 10 is November 13, so that's correct.\n\nNow, I should make sure there isn't another row with the same date. Scanning through again, no other rows have November 13. So the only relevant cell is in week 10 for game site.\n\nTherefore, the claim matches exactly what's in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is stating that in November 6, 1960 (wait, actually, looking at the table, I see dates up to December 14, 1960, but the claim mentions November 6, 1980. That might be a typo or a mistake because the table only goes up to December 14, 1960. Hmm, that could be important.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a typo. Let me check the table again. The table has weeks from week 1 to week 14, with dates ranging from September 9, 1960, to December 14, 1960. So all games in the table are in 1960. But the claim refers to November 6, 1980. That's a different year and even a different decade. So that date isn't present in the table at all.\n\nSo if the claim is about November 6, 1980, but the table doesn't have any data for that year or month beyond 1960, then maybe the claim is incorrect because there's no tied game on that date in the provided data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be November 6, 1960. Let me check if week 9 of 1960 had a tied game. Looking at the table:\n\nWeek 12: December 27, 1960 vs Buffalo Bills, result t 38 - 38. So that's a tie. So in the table, there is at least one tied game on December 27, 1960.\n\nBut the claim says November 6, 1980 is the only record of a tied game that year. Since 1980 isn't covered in the table, and if we assume it's supposed to be November 6, 1960, then even so, there was another tied game on December 27, 1960.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is saying that November 6, 1960 was the only tied game during that entire year. But in the table, there are multiple games: from September to December. And week 12 had a tie. So if the claim says it's the only one, but we have at least two tied games (November 6 and December 27), then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again: \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year.\" Since 1980 isn't in the table, and there's no data for that year, it can't be supported by the table. So regardless of whether other ties exist, because the date isn't present, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe the user made a mistake in the date? Let me check the table again for November 6, 1960. Looking at week 9: November 6, 1960 vs Houston Oilers, result l 25-45. No tie there. So if the claim refers to a tied game on that date, but according to the table, it's not tied. Then the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, in the table, I see week 12: December 27, 1960 vs Buffalo Bills, result t 38-38. That's a tie. So there was at least one tied game in 1960. If the claim says that November 6, 1980 (which doesn't exist in the table) is the only tied game that year, but in reality, there was another tied game on December 27, 1960, then it's false.\n\nAlternatively, if the user meant November 6, 1960, but the result for that week is a loss, so no tie. So the claim would be incorrect either way.\n\nAlso, the structure of the table shows that each week has its own row, and we can check which weeks had tied games. Only week 12 in 1960 resulted in a tie.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim refers to November 6, 1980, which isn't in the table. Even if we assume it's supposed to be 1960, there was another tied game on December 27, 1960, making the claim false because it's not the only one that year. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a tied game on November 6, 1980, which isn't present in the table. Even if considering 1960, there was another tied game on December 27, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"On November 13, 1960, the game site was the Cotton Bowl and the attendance was over 21,000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific date: November 13, 1960. I should find the corresponding row in the table. Let me scan through each week's date:\n\n- Week 1: September 9, 1960\n- Week 2: September 18, 1960\n- Week 3: September 23, 1960\n- Week 4: October 2, 1960\n- Week 6: October 16, 1960\n- Week 7: October 23, 1960\n- Week 8: October 30, 1960\n- Week 9: November 6, 1960\n- Week 10: November 13, 1960\n- Week 11: November 20, 1960\n- Week 12: November 27, 1960\n- Week 13: December 4, 1960\n- Week 14: December 10, 1960\n\nWeek 10 corresponds to November 13, 1960. So the relevant row is row_index 9.\n\nNext, I need to check two things: game site and attendance for that week (row 9).\n\nLooking at the 'game site' column for Week 10: It's the Cotton Bowl. That matches the claim's first part.\n\nNow, checking the attendance. The table shows 21,000 for Week 10. The claim says \"attendance be over 21,000.\" Is 21,000 considered over? Sometimes \"over\" means strictly greater than 21,000, but in this context, it might include equal to or more. However, since the attendance is exactly 21,000, it's not over; it's equal. Therefore, the attendance part of the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, let me double-check: The table for Week 10 has an attendance value of 21000. The claim says \"attendance be over 21000.\" Over implies more than, so 21,000 is not over; it's exactly 21,000. So the attendance condition isn't met.\n\nTherefore, even though the game site is correct, the attendance isn't over 21,000. This means the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about two specific attributes on November 13, 1960: the game site and the attendance. \n\n- **Game Site**: Correctly identified as the Cotton Bowl.\n- **Attendance**: The table shows exactly 21,000 attendees, not over 21,000.\n\nSince one of the conditions isn't met, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on this table. The claim says, \"the team's record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 9928.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The team's record should be exactly 4 wins and 4 losses, which is a tie in terms of wins and losses. Wait, no\u2014actually, a 4-4 record would mean four wins and four losses, not including ties or any other outcomes. But looking at the table, I see that some records have \"-1\" next to them, like \"4 - 6 -1\". So maybe it's considering ties as part of the overall record.\n\nNext, the attendance should be 9928 when this happens. So I need to find a game where the attendance is exactly 9928 and also check if the team's record at that point is 4-4 or similar.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The last two rows have attendance numbers: \n\n- Row 12: attendance is 7785\n- Row 14: attendance is 9928\n\nSo the only game with 9928 attendance is in row 14. Now I need to check what the team's record was when this happened.\n\nIn row 14, the date is December 10, 1960. The opponent was Los Angeles Chargers, and the result was a loss: l 33 - 41. The record for that game is listed as \"4 - 8 -1\". Wait, so their overall record after this game was 4 wins, 8 losses, and one tie?\n\nBut the claim says the team's record should be 4-4 when attendance is 9928. So I'm comparing two things: the attendance being exactly 9928 and the record being 4-4.\n\nFrom the table, the only game with attendance 9928 is row 14, where their record after that game was 4-8-1. That doesn't match 4-4. So maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the record is updated. Maybe each week's result affects the overall record. Let me go through each game and see when the team might have had a 4-4 record before this particular game on December 10.\n\nLooking at row 14 again: the attendance was 9928 on December 10, 1960, but their record after that game is 4-8-1. So at that specific game, they lost and ended up with that record. But maybe I should check if before this game, their record was 4-4.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row represents a single game's result. So the \"record\" column probably shows the team's standing after that game. For example, row 1: after winning week 1, they are 1-0. Row 2: 2-0, and so on.\n\nSo in row 14, their record after losing to Los Angeles Chargers is 4-8-1. That means before this game, maybe their record was different? But the attendance of 9928 corresponds to that specific loss where they ended up with 4-8-1. So unless the record is referring to something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that when a particular game has an attendance of 9928, the team's overall record at that point was 4-4. But from the table, that specific game resulted in a loss, making their record 4-8-1. Therefore, this doesn't match 4-4.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the claim is about the exact moment when attendance was 9928, regardless of the result. So perhaps before the game or during the game, but I don't think that's how it works. The attendance is recorded after the game is played, right? So in row 14, after the game, their attendance was 9928 and their record became 4-8-1.\n\nSo there isn't a week where they had a 4-4 record with attendance 9928. In fact, looking through all rows:\n\n- Row 9: November 6, 1960, attendance 14489, but their record was 4-4 before this game? Wait, in row 9, the result is l 25-45, so after that game, they were 4-5. So maybe prior to that game, they were at 4-4, but the game itself took them to 4-5.\n\nBut the attendance for row 9 was 14489, not 9928.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the team had a 4-4 record in some week with attendance 9928. But looking through each row:\n\nThe only attendance of 9928 is in row 14. In that game, their record after the game was 4-8-1, which isn't 4-4.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at row 12: November 27, 1960, against Buffalo Bills, attendance 7785, result is a tie (38-38), record becomes 4-6-1.\n\nRow 13: December 4, 1960, against NY Titans, loss, attendance 5861, record 4-7-1.\n\nRow 14: December 10, 1960, against LA Chargers, loss, attendance 9928, record 4-8-1.\n\nSo none of the games with high attendance have a team record of 4-4. In fact, in row 9 (attendance 14489), their result was a loss, taking them from 4-3 to 4-4? Wait no:\n\nLooking at each week's progress:\n\nWeek 1: win \u2192 1-0\n\nWeek 2: win \u2192 2-0\n\nWeek 3: ? No, only up to row 14.\n\nWait perhaps I should map out the team's record progression. Let me list all games with their results:\n\nRow 1: Win (1-0)\n\nRow 2: Win (2-0)\n\nRow 3: ?\n\nWait, the table provided starts from week 1 to week 14 presumably, but without more info.\n\nLooking at row 9: opponent NY Titans, result loss, so team goes from ? Let me see:\n\nWait each row's \"record\" is after that game. So:\n\nRow 1: 1-0\n\nRow 2: 2-0\n\n...\n\nRow 8: Not sure, but let's say until row 9.\n\nRow 9: result loss \u2192 record becomes 4-5? Or maybe prior to this game, they were 3-4 or something?\n\nWait the problem is that without seeing all the rows in between, it's hard. But from what we have:\n\nOnly row 14 has attendance 9928, and their record after that was 4-8-1.\n\nSo unless there's a week where their record was 4-4 with attendance 9928, which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in another interpretation: when the game had an attendance of 9928, the team was at 4 wins and 4 losses (4-4) before that game. But then, in row 14, the result would make it 5-8 or something else.\n\nBut again, the record after the game is 4-8-1, which doesn't align with 4-4.\n\nWait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim says: when attendance was 9928, their record was 4-4. But in reality, at that specific game, they had lost and were at 4-8-1. So unless the record is being considered before the loss.\n\nBut that would require knowing what their record was prior to that game, which isn't provided directly here.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a different week, so the \"record\" is cumulative up to that week. But in that case, for each week:\n\n- Week 1: Record 1-0\n\n- Week 2: 2-0\n\n...\n\nIf I go through each week's record:\n\nAssuming that each game's result contributes to the overall record.\n\nSo after week 9 (row 9), their record is 4-5, because it was a loss.\n\nAfter week 14 (row 14), their record is 4-8-1.\n\nBut where does 4-4 come in? Let me see:\n\nWeek by week:\n\nAssuming each row is a week:\n\nIf they play one game per week, then the \"record\" would be cumulative. So perhaps after some weeks, their record was exactly 4 wins and 4 losses (4-4).\n\nLooking at the table, let's suppose that in week N, they had a game where attendance was 9928 and their overall record became 4-4.\n\nBut from the data:\n\nOnly row 14 has attendance 9928. After that game, their record is 4-8-1.\n\nSo perhaps it's impossible based on this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think differently: when a certain number of fans attended (9928), their team was at 4-4. But unless the game resulted in them going to 5-4 or something, which isn't indicated here.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the \"record\" column shows the score rather than the wins/losses. For example, perhaps \"4-4\" could be referring to the score, not the record. But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant 4 wins, 3 losses, etc., but the key is that in no case does attendance at 9928 correspond to a 4-4 record from the data provided.\n\nThus, based on the table, there's no week where attendance was 9928 and their team had a 4-4 record.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that when the attendance reached 9,928, the team's record was 4-4 is not supported by the data provided. Upon analyzing each game in the table, the only instance where the attendance was 9,928 occurred on December 10, 1960, against the Los Angeles Chargers. At this game, the team's record after the loss became 4-8-1, which does not align with a 4-4 record. Therefore, there is no evidence in the table to support the claim.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is incorrect based on the provided data.",
