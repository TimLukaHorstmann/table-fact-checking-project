    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy having 14 rebounds against Miami. I need to check if these two players indeed had the highest rebound count in a game where they played against Miami.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game, with various columns like date, team, score, etc., including \"high rebounds\". So, for each game where Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy were part of the high rebounds, I should check if their total is 14 and whether that's the highest in that game.\n\nStarting by scanning through each row:\n\n- Game 73: High rebounds are Michael Bradley (14) and Jelani McCoy (14). But wait, it says both have 14. The claim mentions \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14)\", so maybe they combined? No, the column is \"high rebounds\" which likely lists the top performer(s). So in Game 73, Michael Bradley has 14 rebounds as the highest.\n- Game 74: High rebounds are Jerome Williams with 16. So that's higher than any mentioned players here.\n- Game 75: High rebounds are Michael Bradley (8) and others. Not relevant since the claim is about 14.\n- Game 76: Jelani McCoy has 9 rebounds, which is less than 14.\n- Game 77: Michael Bradley has 8, others have lower.\n- Game 78: Jerome Williams with 10, so no.\n- Game 79: High rebounds are Jerome Williams (13). So again, higher than 14.\n- Game 80: Michael Bradley and Morris Peterson both have 8. No.\n- Game 81: Morris Peterson has 17, which is higher.\n- Game 82: Michael Bradley with 10.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically says \"against miami\". Looking back at the table, in which games did they play against Miami? Scanning through:\n\nGame 73: Against Detroit\nGame 74: Against Detroit\nGame 75: Against San Antonio\nGame 76: Against New Jersey\nGame 77: Against Miami (yes)\nGame 78: Against Orlando\nGame 79: Against Milwaukee\nGame 80: Against New Jersey\nGame 81: Against Miami (yes again)\nGame 82: Against Cleveland\n\nSo in games against Miami, which are 77 and 81.\n\nLooking at Game 77: High rebounds are Michael Bradley (8). So that's lower than 14.\nIn Game 81: Morris Peterson has 17, so no. Wait, but the claim says \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14)\", so perhaps in another game? But looking through all games against Miami, neither of them have 14 rebounds by Michael or Jelani.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim might not specify which particular game, just that in any game against Miami, they had the highest rebounds. So checking all games where both were part of the high rebounds and against Miami.\n\nLooking through all games:\n\n- Game 73: Both have 14, but against Detroit.\n- Game 77: Michael has 8.\n- Game 81: Morris Peterson has 17, others lower.\n\nSo in no game against Miami do Michael or Jelani have a combined or individual 14 rebounds as the highest. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of them having the highest rebounds when playing against Miami.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks each game where Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy were part of the high rebounds and specifically against Miami. None of those instances show their rebound count reaching 14 as the highest. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. Identify all games involving Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy with high rebounds.\n2. Check if any of these games are against Miami.\n3. Verify if their total rebounds in these games equal 14 and are the highest.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because there's no game where Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy have 14 rebounds as the highest against Miami.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 77, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 81, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
