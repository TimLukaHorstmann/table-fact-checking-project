    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"home team melbourne victory have a score of 1 - 3 on july 29.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions the home team as Melbourne Victory and their score against another team on July 29th with a result of 1-3.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row where the date is July 29. Let's see which rows those are. Scanning through the table:\n\n- 15 july\n- 16 july\n- 22 july\n- 29 july\n- 30 july\n- 4 august\n- 5 august\n- 6 august\n\nSo, the July 29 row is two entries: one for New Zealand Knights vs Sydney FC and another for Melbourne Victory against Central Coast Mariners.\n\nNow, focusing on the home team being Melbourne Victory. In the table, when Melbourne Victory is the home team, which game do they play? Looking at the rows, on July 29th, Melbourne Victory plays Central Coast Mariners with a score of 1-3. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. The row for 29 july has two entries:\n\n1. New Zealand Knights 0 - 0 Sydney FC\n2. Melbourne Victory 1 - 3 Central Coast Mariners\n\nYes, so in the second entry on July 29th, Melbourne Victory is the home team with a score of 1-3 against Central Coast Mariners.\n\nSo, the claim says that \"home team melbourne victory have a score of 1 - 3 on july 29.\" That matches exactly what's in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"there be game with a score of 0 - 0 held on july 22, july 29, july 30, and august 6.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It's saying that there are games on specific dates (July 22, July 29, July 30, August 6) where the score was 0-0.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has a date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, and report. I need to check for each of those dates if there's a game with a 0-0 score.\n\nI'll start by identifying all games that happened on July 22. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 4: July 22, New Zealand Knights vs Newcastle Jets, score 1-1.\n- Row 5: July 22, Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United, score 0-0. Okay, so there's one game on July 22 with a 0-0 score.\n\nNext, July 29:\n\n- Row 8: July 29, Newcastle Jets vs Queensland Roar, score 0-0.\n- Row 9: July 29, Melbourne Victory vs Central Coast Mariners, score 1-3. No 0-0 here.\n- So, there's one game on July 29 with a 0-0.\n\nJuly 30:\n\nLooking for July 30, the relevant row is row 10:\n\n- July 30, Perth Glory vs Adelaide United, score 0-0. Yes, that's another 0-0 game.\n\nAugust 6:\n\nLooking at August 6, it's in rows 13 and 14:\n\n- Row 13: Queenslad Roar vs Central Coast Mariners, score 0-0.\n- Wait, no, row 13 is August 4, which is Adelaide United vs New Zealand Knights with a 1-0 score.\n\nRow 14: August 5, Newcastle Jets vs Melbourne Victory, 2-3. Not 0-0.\n\nWait, actually, row 15 is August 6: Queensland Roar vs Central Coast Mariners at Clive Burghofer Stadium with a score of 0-0. So that's another game on August 6 with a 0-0 score.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nJuly 22: 1 game (Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United)\nJuly 29: 1 game (Newcastle Jets vs Queensland Roar)\nJuly 30: 1 game (Perth Glory vs Adelaide United)\nAugust 6: 1 game (Queensland Roar vs Central Coast Mariners)\n\nEach of these dates has at least one game with a 0-0 score. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells in the table support this claim. For each relevant date and score cell, I'll note their row indices and column names.\n\nLooking for the specific dates:\n\nJuly 22: The relevant row is 4 (row index starts at 0). Columns are 'date', 'home team', 'score', etc. So the 'score' would be under the third column, which is \"score\".\n\nSimilarly, each of these games will have their scores in the 'score' column.\n\nSo, for each date:\n\n- July 22: row index 4, column 'score'\n- July 29: row index 8, column 'score'\n- July 30: row index 10, column 'score'\n- August 6: row index 15, column 'score'\n\nWait, let me check the row indices:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n1. 15 july\n2. 15 july\n3. 16 july\n4. 16 july\n5. 22 july\n6. 22 july\n7. 22 july\n8. 22 july\n9. 29 july\n10. 29 july\n11. 30 july\n12. 4 august\n13. 5 august\n14. 6 august\n15. 6 august\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nThe rows are numbered from 0 to N based on the markdown table. So row 0 is July 15.\n\nLooking at each date:\n\n- July 22: The relevant games are in rows 4 and 5, but wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal table rows (with indexes):\n\nRow 0: 15 july\nRow1:15july\nRow2:16july\nRow3:16july\nRow4:22july\nRow5:22july\nRow6:22july\nRow7:22july\nRow8:29july\nRow9:29july\nRow10:30july\nRow11:4august\nRow12:5august\nRow13:6august\nRow14:6august\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me list all the rows properly:\n\nThe table starts with 15 july as first row (row 0), then row1 is same date, etc.\n\nSo each pair of dates shares a row index.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n- Row 0: July 15\n- Row1: July15\n- Row2:July16\n- Row3:July16\n- Row4:July22\n- Row5:July22\n- Row6:July22\n- Row7:July22 (Wait, no, in the original table, each date is split into two rows? Let me check.\n\nOriginal table:\n\nRow0:15july home team, score...\n\nYes, the initial data shows 12 games, with each day split into two or more rows.\n\nSo to get exact row indices for each July22 game:\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\nRow4: July22\nRow5: July22 (Central Coast Mariners)\nRow6: July22 (another team?)\n\nWait no, actually, I think the table is as follows:\n\nEach row is a separate entry.\n\nOriginal data has 12 entries? Or more?\n\nLet me count:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. 15 july\n2. 15july\n3.16july\n4.16july\n5.22july\n6.22july\n7.22july\n8.22july\n9.29july\n10.29july\n11.30july\n12.4august\n13.5august\n14.6august\n15.6august\n\nYes, 15 rows in total.\n\nSo for the specific games:\n\nJuly22: row4 (Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United), score is 0-0 at row4[3].\n\nSimilarly, July29: row8 and row9 are both July29? No, looking again:\n\nRow8: July29\nRow9: July29\n\nLooking at row8: Newcastle Jets vs Queensland Roar, score 0-0.\n\nYes, so that's a 0-0 game on July29.\n\nJuly30 is row10: Perth Glory vs Adelaide United, score 0-0.\n\nAugust6 is row13 and row14:\n\nRow13: August4\nRow14: August5\nWait no, perhaps not. Let me see the dates in each row:\n\nRow12: August4\nRow13: August5\nRow14: August6\n\nSo row14 is August6: Queensland Roar vs Central Coast Mariners, score 0-0.\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows are 4,8,10, and14 for the 0-0 games.\n\nEach of these has a 'score' column that shows 0-0.\n\nThus, in each case, the 'score' cell is 0-0. So for each of those four rows, I'll note their row index and column 'score'.\n\nSo the cells are:\n\nRow4: (date: July22), score: 0-0 \u2192 columns: 'score'\n\nRow8: July29, score:0-0\n\nRow10: July30, score:0-0\n\nRow14: August6, score:0-0\n\nTherefore, each of these four rows has a 'score' column value that supports the claim.\n\nSo to answer the question, I need to list which cells (row indices and column names) have the 0-0 scores for those dates.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by four specific games in the table:\n\n1. July 22: Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United (Row 4, 'score' column)\n2. July 29: Newcastle Jets vs Queensland Roar (Row 8, 'score' column)\n3. July 30: Perth Glory vs Adelaide United (Row 10, 'score' column)\n4. August 6: Queensland Roar vs Central Coast Mariners (Row 14, 'score' column)\n\nEach of these games has a score of 0-0.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is supported by the following cells in the table:\n\n- Row 4, \"score\" column\n- Row 8, \"score\" column\n- Row 10, \"score\" column\n- Row 14, \"score\" column\n\nEach of these corresponds to a game on July 22, July 29, July 30, and August 6 with a score of 0-0.",

    "claim": "the score be 1 - 3 on 22 july",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the score be 1 - 3 on 22 july\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and return the relevant cells in a JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, and report. Each row represents a match between two teams on a specific date.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the score being 1 - 3 on July 22nd. So, I'll look for entries in the table where the date is 22 July and check if any of them have a score that matches 1-3.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find the one with \"22 july\" as the date. Scrolling down:\n\n- The first entry on 15 July doesn't match.\n- Next, 16 July entries are for different dates.\n- Then comes 22 July:\n  - The first match on 22 July is between Sydney FC and Newcastle Jets with a score of 2-1. That's not the one we're looking for.\n  - Second entry: Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United, score 0-0. Still not matching.\n  - Third entry: Perth Glory vs Melbourne Victory, score 1-1. Not a 1-3 result.\n  - Fourth entry: Queensland Roar vs New Zealand Knights, score 1-1. Again, not matching.\n\nWait, that's only four entries for 22 July, but the claim is about 22 July having a score of 1-3. Hmm, maybe I missed some rows. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again, after 29 July and 30 July, the next date is August 4th. So all the 22 July entries have been checked. None of them show a 1-3 score.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I misread one of the scores. Let me go row by row:\n\n1. 15 july: Central Coast Mariners 2-1 Perth Glory \u2013 not relevant.\n2. 15 july: Queensland Roar 1-2 Sydney FC \u2013 nope.\n3. 16 july: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Adelaide United \u2013 score is 0-1, different from 1-3.\n4. 16 july: New Zealand Knights 1-1 Newcastle Jets \u2013 not matching.\n5. 22 july: Sydney FC 2-1 Newcastle Jets \u2013 nope.\n6. 22 july: Central Coast Mariners 0-0 Adelaide United \u2013 still not it.\n7. 22 july: Perth Glory 1-1 Melbourne Victory \u2013 score is 1-1, not 1-3.\n8. 22 july: Queensland Roar 1-1 New Zealand Knights \u2013 again, 1-1.\n\nSo none of the matches on 22 July have a score of 1-3.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked an entry. Let me check if there's another match on 22 July that I didn't account for. Looking back at the table:\n\nIt seems that the entries after 29 July are on August 4th and onwards, so no, all 22 July matches have been considered.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by any data in the table. There's no match on 22 July with a score of 1-3.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to find which rows and columns are related to this check.\n\nEach row has a date, so for 22 july, the row index is important. Let me count the rows starting from the first one:\n\nLooking at the table, the entries start with 15 July as row 0:\n\nRow 0: 15 july...\nRow 1: 15 july...\nRow 2: 16 july...\nRow 3: 16 july...\nRow 4: 22 july (Sydney FC vs Newcastle Jets)\nRow 5: 22 july (Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United)\nRow 6: 22 july (Perth Glory vs Melbourne Victory)\nRow 7: 22 july (Queensland Roar vs New Zealand Knights)\n\nSo, the rows for 22 July are indices 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nEach of these has a score column. So the relevant columns would be \"score\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 4, column_name: score\n- Row index 5, column_name: score\n- Row index 6, column_name: score\n- Row index 7, column_name: score\n\nI should list these as a JSON array with each having their respective row_index and column_name.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe answer is FALSE because there's no match on 22 July with the score of 1-3. The relevant cells are the four score entries for that date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Sydney lose to Perth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It's saying that Sydney lost a game against Perth. To verify this, I'll look for any matches in the table where Sydney is the home team and Perth is the away team, or vice versa. The key here is to find cells related to Sydney and Perth in the same match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different date and the corresponding game details. Each row has columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, and report. My focus will be on the \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and \"score\" columns because these directly relate to whether Sydney lost or won against Perth.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **15 July**: Home team is Central Coast Mariners vs. Perth Glory. Here, Perth is the away team, but Sydney isn't involved. So, no relevance to the claim.\n2. **16 July**: Melbourne Victory vs. Adelaide United. Neither team is Sydney or Perth. No relevance.\n3. **22 July**:\n   - Home: Central Coast Mariners vs. Adelaide United. Again, not Sydney or Perth.\n   - Queenslad Roar vs. New Zealand Knights. Not relevant.\n   - Sydney FC vs. Newcastle Jets. Sydney is home, but Perth isn't involved.\n4. **29 July**: Newcastle Jets vs. Queensland Roar and Melbourne Victory vs. Central Coast Mariners. No Sydney or Perth here either.\n5. **30 July**: Perth Glory vs. Adelaide United. Here, Perth is the home team, but Sydney isn't involved.\n\nMoving on to **4 August**: Adelaide United vs. New Zealand Knights. Not relevant.\n\n**5 August**: Newcastle Jets vs. Melbourne Victory. Not relevant.\n\n**6 August**: Queensland Roar vs. Central Coast Mariners. No Sydney or Perth here.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me check the 22 July row again. Oh, in the third match on that day: Perth Glory is the away team against Melbourne Victory. So, home team is Perth and away is Melbourne. That's a different scenario; the claim is about Sydney losing to Perth.\n\nNext, looking for any matches where Sydney is one of the teams and Perth is the other.\n\nChecking each row:\n\n- On 15 July: No.\n- 16 July: No.\n- 22 July:\n  - Sydney FC vs Newcastle Jets (Sydney home).\n  - Perth Glory as away in another match.\n- 29 July:\n  - Melbourne Victory vs Central Coast Mariners; no Sydney or Perth.\n  - Newcastle Jets vs Queensland Roar; not relevant.\n- 30 July: Perth Glory as home against Adelaide United.\n\nWait, is there a row where Sydney plays against Perth? Let me scan all dates:\n\nLooking through the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns for both Sydney FC and Perth Glory.\n\nOn 22 July, there's a match between Sydney FC (home) and Newcastle Jets. So Sydney is home but not facing Perth.\n\nThen, on 6 August: Sydney FC vs Perth Glory? Wait, no, on 6 August, the match is Queensland Roar vs Central Coast Mariners. No Sydney or Perth there.\n\nWait, looking at the last row:\n\nOn 6 August, in the last entry, it's Sydney FC (home) against Perth Glory (away). Wait, let me check that again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 6 August: queensland roar | sydney fc | 3 - 0 | perth glory\n\nWait, no. The row for 6 August shows \"queensland roar\" as home, \"sydney fc\" as away? No, looking at the table, the columns are:\n\ndate | home team | score | away team | venue | crowd | report.\n\nSo on 6 August, the row is:\n\n| 6 august | queensland roar        | 0 - 0   | central coast mariners | clive burghofer stadium         | 4571 (toowoomba)    | -        |\n| 6 august | sydney fc              | 3 - 0   | perth glory            | win stadium                     | 6634 (wollongong)   | -        |\n\nWait, so two entries for 6 August? That seems odd. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the provided markdown:\n\n- 29 july: newcastle jets and queensland roar\n- 30 july: perth glory vs adelaide united\n- 4 august: adelaide united vs new zealand knights\n- 5 august: newcastle jets vs melbourne victory\n- 6 august: queensland roar vs central coast mariners\n- 6 august: sydney fc vs perth glory\n\nAh, so on 6 August, there are two matches. One is Queensland Roar vs Central Coast Mariners, and the other is Sydney FC vs Perth Glory.\n\nSo in that second match on 6 August, Sydney FC is home and Perth Glory is away. The score is 3-0 for Sydney. Therefore, Sydney won, not lost to Perth.\n\nWait, but the claim is \"Sydney lose to Perth.\" So I need to check if there's any match where Sydney loses when playing against Perth.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\nOn 6 August: Sydney FC (home) vs Perth Glory (away), score 3-0. Sydney won.\n\nIn other matches involving both, let me see:\n\nWait, is there a match where Perth is home and Sydney is away? Let's check each row again.\n\nIn 15 July: Central Coast Mariners (home) vs Perth Glory (away). So Perth as away, but not facing Sydney.\n\n22 July: Perth is away in one match, and in another, Sydney is home against Newcastle.\n\n29 July: No matches involving both.\n\n30 July: Perth is home against Adelaide.\n\n4 August: Adelaide vs New Zealand.\n\n5 August: Newcastle vs Melbourne.\n\nSo the only match between Sydney FC and Perth Glory is on 6 August where Sydney wins. Therefore, there's no instance where Sydney loses to Perth in this data set.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a row or misread something. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at all the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns:\n\n- 15 July: Mariners vs Glory\n- 22 July: Roar vs Knights; Sydney vs Newcastle\n- 29 July: Jets vs Roar; Victory vs Mariners\n- 30 July: Glory vs United\n- 4 August: United vs NZ\n- 5 August: Jets vs Victory\n- 6 August: Roar vs Mariners; FC vs Glory\n\nSo the only match where both Sydney and Perth play is on 6 August, with Sydney winning.\n\nTherefore, in all the provided data, there's no instance of Sydney losing to Perth. So the claim \"Sydney lose to Perth\" isn't supported here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread some rows. Let me check each date again:\n\n- 15 July: Mariners (home) vs Glory (away)\n- 16 July: Victory vs United\n- 22 July:\n  - Queenslad Roar (home) vs Knights (away)\n  - Sydney FC (home) vs Newcastle Jets (away)\n- 29 July:\n  - Jets (home) vs Roar (away)\n  - Victory (home) vs Mariners (away)\n- 30 July: Glory (home) vs United (away)\n- 4 August: United (home) vs NZ (away)\n- 5 August: Jets (home) vs Victory (away)\n- 6 August:\n  - Roar (home) vs Mariners (away)\n  - Sydney FC (home) vs Perth Glory (away)\n\nSo on 6 August, the second match is Sydney FC home and Perth Glory away. The score is 3-0 for Sydney.\n\nThus, in all cases where both teams play each other, Sydney wins. Therefore, the claim that \"Sydney lose to Perth\" isn't accurate based on this data.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, there is no instance where Sydney FC loses to Perth Glory. In the only match between them, Sydney won with a score of 3-0.\n\n**Answer:** There is no evidence in the provided data that Sydney FC has lost to Perth Glory.",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It mentions \"Melbourne Victory home team\" and their score being \"2 - 3\". So I'm looking for a game where Melbourne Victory was the home team and scored 2-3 against another team.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided.

Score for Melbourne Victory when they are away is 1-1, which doesn't fit.\n\n4. **29 July**:\n   - Home teams are New Zealand Knights (0-0) vs Sydney FC, Melbourne Victory (1-3) vs Central Coast Mariners, and Newcastle Jets (0-0) vs Queensland Roar.\n   - In this row, Melbourne Victory is the home team with a score of 1-3 against Central Coast Mariners.

However, the claim specifies the home team, so this doesn't fit.\n\n8. **6 August**:\n   - Home team is Sydney FC (3-0) vs Perth Glory.\n   - Not relevant to Melbourne Victory.\n\nAfter going through each row, I notice that there's no instance where Melbourne Victory is the home team with a score of 2-3.
