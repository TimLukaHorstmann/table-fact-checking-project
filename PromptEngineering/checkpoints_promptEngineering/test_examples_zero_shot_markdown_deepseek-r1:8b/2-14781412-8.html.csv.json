    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the equestrian events at the Asian Games happening every four years from 1982 to 2010, except in 1990, is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table shows. The table lists the years from 1982 to 2010, the locations of each Asian Games, and the gold, silver, and bronze medalists for each event. Each row corresponds to a specific year and location.\n\nThe claim says that equestrian events occurred every four years starting from 1982 up until 2010, but they didn't happen in 1990. So, I need to check if there's an equestrian event in 1982, then skip 1986, have one in 1990 (but the claim says except for 1990), wait no\u2014the claim says \"except for in 1990,\" so does that mean 1990 is when it didn't happen? Or did I misread.\n\nWait, the claim states: \"equestrian at the asian game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010 , except for in 1990.\" So perhaps they are saying that equestrian events happened every four years starting from 1982, but in 1990, there was no event. So I need to check if 1990 is a year without an equestrian event.\n\nLooking at the table: The years listed are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010. Wait, so from 1982, adding four years each time would be 1986, then 1990, but 1990 isn't in the table. The next after 1986 is 1994, which is a skip of eight years. So that already breaks the four-year pattern.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says equestrian events happen every four years from 1982 to 2010, except for 1990. So perhaps in 1990, there was no event, so they're saying it didn't occur then. But looking at the table, I don't see a 1990 row, so that would align with the claim.\n\nBut wait, let's check each relevant column and cell to verify. The columns are year, location, gold, silver, bronze. So for equestrian events, we need to find if there was a medalist in each of those years, except for 1990.\n\nSo first, I'll list out the years from 1982 to 2010 where an equestrian event occurred:\n\n- 1982: Yes (row 0)\n- 1986: Let's check if there was a bronze or higher. Looking at row 1 (1986 Seoul), the bronze is ryuzo okuno, so yes.\n- 1990: No event according to the claim, so let's see the table. The next year after 1986 is 1994 (row 2). So 1990 isn't in the table, which supports the claim that it didn't happen.\n\nWait, but in the table, from 1982, the events are every four years except for 1986 to 1994, which skips 1990. So actually, they're not happening every four years as stated in the claim. The claim is incorrect because the events aren't held every four years; there's a gap between 1986 and 1994.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says that equestrian events happen every four years from 1982 to 2010, except for 1990. So perhaps they are saying that in 1990, it didn't happen, but otherwise, every four years. But looking at the table, after 1986, the next is 1994\u2014so that's a six-year gap, not four. So the pattern isn't holding.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding what \"equestrian at the asian game\" refers to. Perhaps it's a specific event within the Asian Games. Let me think: in each year, there are multiple events. So perhaps the equestrian event is one of them, and maybe it's held every four years starting from 1982.\n\nBut looking at the table, the years with equestrian medals are:\n\n- 1982\n- 1986\n- 1994\n- 1998\n- 2002\n- 2006\n- 2010\n\nSo that's a pattern: every four years starting from 1982, except in 1990 where it didn't happen. Wait, but from 1982 to 1986 is four years, then 1986 to 1994 is eight years\u2014that doesn't fit the four-year pattern.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's break down the claim: starting from 1982, every four years until 2010, except for 1990. So in 1982, yes; 1986, yes; 1990, no; 1994, yes; 1998, yes; 2002, yes; 2006, yes; and 2010, yes.\n\nBut according to the table, after 1986, the next equestrian event is in 1994, which would mean it didn't happen in 1990. So that aligns with the claim.\n\nWait, but from 1982, adding four years gives 1986, then 1990\u2014no event; then 1994. So yes, the pattern holds except for 1990. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nBut wait again: in the table, after 1986 (row1), the next equestrian event is in 1994 (row2). That's a gap of eight years. So if the claim says every four years, that would not be accurate because it skips 1990 and has an eight-year gap.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is false because the events are not held every four years as stated\u2014there's a larger gap between 1986 and 1994.\n\nBut I'm confused now. Let me re-examine the table:\n\nRows are: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010.\n\nSo from 1982 to 1986: four years.\n\nThen 1986 to 1994: eight years\u2014so that's two cycles of four.\n\nWait, maybe the events occur every four years starting in 1982, but only when they have medals. So perhaps the claim is correct because the events are held every four years except for 1990 where there was no event.\n\nBut looking at the table, after 1986, it's next in 1994\u2014so that would mean a gap of eight years. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not happening every four years as stated; sometimes it skips two cycles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equestrian events are held in years when the Asian Games were hosted, and the hosting occurs every four years starting from 1982 except for 1990. So maybe the equestrian event is part of those games, which are held every four years, but skipped in 1990.\n\nBut that's a different angle\u2014hosting location versus events. The claim might be referring to the Asian Games themselves being hosted every four years starting from 1982 except for 1990. Then the equestrian event is part of those games, so yes, it aligns with the claim.\n\nBut in the table, looking at the host cities: 1982, 1986, 1994, etc.\u2014so indeed, they are every four years except skipping 1990. So perhaps the claim is correct in that the Asian Games were held every four years from 1982 to 2010, excluding 1990.\n\nTherefore, the equestrian event would have been part of those games, so it's accurate that it was not held in 1990 but was held in all other years listed.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is correct because the Asian Games were indeed held every four years from 1982 to 2010 except for 1990.\n</think>\n\nThe equestrian event at the Asian Games was held every four years from 1982 to 2010, excluding 1990. This aligns with the claim that such events occurred annually as specified.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct; the equestrian events were indeed held every four years from 1982 to 2010, except in 1990.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Equestrian at the Asian Game have been located in a different city every year that it occur.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's suggesting that each year the Asian Games took place, the equestrian events were held in a unique city\u2014meaning no repeats. So, I need to check if each occurrence of \"Equestrian\" (or related terms) corresponds to a different city every year.\n\nLooking at the table, the years involved are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. For each of these years, I'll need to find out which location hosted the equestrian events.\n\nThe columns provided are: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. So, for each relevant year, I should look into the location column to see where the equestrian events were held.\n\nWait, actually, the claim mentions \"Equestrian at the Asian Game,\" so it's about the venue for equestrian events specifically. However, the table lists 'location' as the host city of the Asian Games in general, not specifically for each sport. So, I might need to clarify: are the locations listed for each year the hosts for all sports, including equestrian? Or is there a separate column for specific events?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, it seems that the 'location' column refers to where the Asian Games were held each year. Therefore, each location corresponds to the entire event, which includes all sports, including equestrian. So, if the claim is about the equestrian events specifically, I need to check whether each year's equestrian events were in a different city than the previous ones.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't have separate columns for individual sports. It lists the location as the host city of the Asian Games overall. Therefore, perhaps the claim is actually about the general location, not specific to equestrian. That might change things.\n\nHowever, let's read the claim again: \"Equestrian at the Asian Game have been located in a different city every year that it occur.\" So, it's specifically about the equestrian events within the Asian Games. Therefore, I need to see if each year's equestrian event was held in a different city from the previous years.\n\nBut since the table doesn't specify where each sport was held, only the overall location of the Asian Games, this might not be directly verifiable. Alternatively, perhaps the 'location' column does indeed refer to the specific venue for each sport, including equestrian. That is possible if each event has its own location within the host city.\n\nIn that case, I can check the 'location' column for each year and ensure they are all different, which would support the claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1982: new delhi\n1986: seoul\n1994: hiroshima\n1998: bangkok\n2002: busan\n2006: doha\n2010: guangzhou\n\nEach of these locations is unique and there are no repeats. Therefore, each year the equestrian events were held in a different city.\n\nHence, the claim should be TRUE because every year's location for equestrian at the Asian Games was indeed a new city.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each year's location against the table and found that each host city is unique. Therefore, the claim holds.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Nadia Al-Moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see if there's any information about Nadia Al-Moutawaa and whether she won a gold medal in equestrian. The table has columns for year, location, gold, silver, and bronze, each representing different athletes or competitors.\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n- 1982: Delhi, Nadia Al-Moutawaa is listed as the gold medalist. But what sport was she competing in? Looking at the column headers, it just says \"gold,\" not specifying the event. So I need to figure out if this is equestrian.\n\nWait, maybe the table includes all sports, and each row corresponds to a specific event's winners for each medal. Since the claim is about equestrian, I should check if any of the gold winners are listed as equestrians.\n\nLooking at the first row (1982), Nadia Al-Moutawaa won gold. But without knowing the sport, it's unclear. Maybe I need to look elsewhere or see if the same name appears again in another event.\n\nWait, perhaps the table only lists specific sports, and each year corresponds to a different Asian Games. So, for example, 1982 was the Asian Games held in New Delhi, and Nadia Al-Moutawaa won gold there. The claim says she's the first person to win gold in equestrian at the Asian Games.\n\nSo I need to confirm if she was indeed competing in equestrian. If yes, then she would be the first. Alternatively, maybe she wasn't an equestrian competitor, but another athlete from a different event might have been the first.\n\nWait, perhaps each row lists different events. So in 1982, maybe Nadia won gold in equestrian, while others won in other sports like athletics or swimming. If that's the case, then she would be the first in equestrian. But I'm not sure if the table specifies the event.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the columns: it's \"gold,\" but perhaps each medal is for a different sport. So in 1982, the gold might be equestrian, silver maybe another event like shooting or fencing, and bronze something else.\n\nBut the problem is that the claim is about equestrian specifically. So I need to see if Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first equestrian to win gold at the Asian Games.\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n1982: Gold is Nadia Al-Moutawaa. If this was equestrian, then she's the first. But since it's not specified, maybe I can't confirm yet.\n\nWait, perhaps the table only lists equestrian medalists for certain years when that event was held. Alternatively, each year might have a different set of sports, so in 1982, equestrian was likely one of them, making Nadia the first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's not the first because another person won before her in an earlier Asian Games. But since this is the earliest row with her name as gold, perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the table includes all sports or only specific ones. Without more context, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe the claim is false because she wasn't the first in equestrian; someone else was earlier.\n\nBut wait, looking at the next rows:\n\n1986: Seoul. Gold is Takashi Tomura. Probably not related to equestrian.\n\n1994: Hiroshima. Gold is Konoshin Kuwahara. Not relevant.\n\n1998: Bangkok. Gold is Jin Kanno. \n\n2002: Busan. Gold is Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00eda Jaworski.\n\n2006: Doha. Gold is Ali Youssuf Al-Rumaihi.\n\n2010: Guangzhou. Gold is Ramzy Al-Duhami.\n\nNone of these names are Nadia again, so maybe the first occurrence was in 1982, and she's the first to win gold in equestrian at the Asian Games. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if the table includes all years and events correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the first time someone won equestrian was earlier than 1982. But since the table starts in 1982, maybe she is indeed the first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is FALSE because Nadia wasn't the first; someone else from a previous year is listed here but not shown in the table.\n\nWait, but the table only shows years starting from 1982 onwards. If there was an Asian Games before 1982 where equestrian was an event, and someone won gold then, she wouldn't be the first. But since the table doesn't include those earlier years, perhaps we can assume that she is indeed the first based on this data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because in 1982, Nadia Al-Moutawaa won gold, which would make her the first to do so in equestrian at the Asian Games according to the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first person to win a gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games. Checking the table, she is listed as the gold medalist for 1982 in New Delhi. Since this is the earliest year in the table and it's likely that equestrian was an event during that Asian Games, Nadia would be the first to win gold in her event based on the provided information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, the task is to determine whether the claim about the gold medalists in equestrian at the Asian Games being different each year is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim properly. The claim says, \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Game have been different in every year they have occurred.\" So, I'm looking to see if each subsequent gold medalist is unique compared to all previous years listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. The relevant column here is \"gold,\" specifically for equestrian events. From the table, the years provided are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nI need to list out all the gold medalists in these years:\n\n- 1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n- 1986: Takashi Tomura\n- 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- 1998: Jin Kanno\n- 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski\n- 2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi\n- 2010: Ramzy Al-Duhami\n\nNow, I'll check if each gold medalist is different from all the others.\n\nStarting with 1982, Nadia Al-Moutawaa is unique. Moving to 1986, Takashi Tomura hasn't appeared before. In 1994, Konoshin Kuwahara is new. Then in 1998, Jin Kanno is a new name. Next, Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski in 2002 hasn't been listed before. Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi in 2006 is also unique so far. Finally, Ramzy Al-Duhami in 2010 hasn't appeared in any of the previous years.\n\nSince each gold medalist is distinct across all the years listed, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about the gold medalists being different each year is true, I will verify that every subsequent gold medalist in equestrian at the Asian Games is unique compared to all prior years.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is about South Korea being the only country to have hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically in Seoul and Doha, with an additional note about Incheon but it's mentioned that information might be elsewhere.\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n\n1. South Korea is the only country.\n2. They have hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once.\n3. Specifically in Seoul and Doha.\n4. There's a mention of Incheon, but that information is possibly elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any relevant data that might support or contradict this claim.\n\nThe table has columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. Each row represents an event with details about the participants in each medal category.\n\nI think the first step is to identify which countries are involved in hosting these events. The locations listed are New Delhi, Seoul, Hiroshima, Bangkok, Busan, Doha, and Guangzhou.\n\nSo, South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul) and 2006 (Doha). Are there any other countries that have hosted more than once? Let's check each location:\n\n- New Delhi: Hosted in 1982. Is this India? Yes. So India has hosted once.\n- Seoul: South Korea, as mentioned.\n- Hiroshima: Japan, hosted in 1994.\n- Bangkok: Thailand, 1998.\n- Busan: South Korea, 2002.\n- Doha: Qatar, 2006 (also hosted by South Korea).\n- Guangzhou: China, 2010.\n\nFrom this, only South Korea has hosted twice (Seoul and Doha). The claim says they are the only ones to have hosted equestrian events more than once in these locations. So I need to confirm if other countries have done so elsewhere or not.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't list Incheon as a host location. According to the claim, Incheon is another hosting location for South Korea, but it's mentioned that information isn't found here. So perhaps Incheon is another instance where South Korea hosted equestrian events.\n\nSo, if South Korea has hosted three times: Seoul (1986), Busan (2002), and possibly Incheon, which might be another event not listed in the table. The claim says \"more than once,\" so even if they have three, it's still valid as more than one.\n\nNow, are there any other countries that have hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games multiple times? Let me check each country based on their hosting locations:\n\n- India (New Delhi 1982): Once.\n- South Korea (Seoul 1986, Doha 2006, Busan 2002, possibly Incheon elsewhere): At least twice, maybe three times.\n- Japan (Hiroshima 1994): Once.\n- Thailand (Bangkok 1998): Once.\n- China (Guangzhou 2010): Once.\n\nSo based on the table, only South Korea has hosted more than once. The claim is that they are the only country to have hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than one time in Seoul and Doha, with Incheon being another location but possibly elsewhere in the source page.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be those where South Korea hosted in Seoul (1986) and Doha (2006), as well as possibly Busan (2002). But since the claim specifically mentions Seoul and Doha, I should focus on those. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 2006: Doha\n\nThese are two instances where South Korea hosted. Additionally, Busan is another instance in 2002, but it's not mentioned in the claim. However, since the claim says \"more than once,\" even if they have more than two, it still holds.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For 1986: row index 1 (since indexing starts at 0), location is Seoul.\n- For 2006: row index 6, location Doha.\n\nWait, let me check the table structure. The first row is 1982 as row 0, so:\n\nRow 0: 1982 New Delhi\nRow 1: 1986 Seoul\nRow 2: 1994 Hiroshima\nRow 3: 1998 Bangkok\nRow 4: 2002 Busan\nRow 5: 2006 Doha\nRow 6: 2010 Guangzhou\n\nSo, row 1 is Seoul (South Korea), and row 5 is Doha (Qatar). Wait, no, Doha is Qatar's location. So the claim says South Korea hosted in Seoul and Doha.\n\nWait, that might be a mistake. Because Doha is Qatar's city, so hosting there would mean Qatar, not South Korea. So maybe the claim is incorrect because South Korea only hosted in Seoul and Busan, but not Doha.\n\nHold on, this changes things. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe table shows Doha as the location for 2006. The gold medalist that year was Ali Yousef Al-Rumaihi, which I believe is from Qatar. So Doha is hosted by Qatar, not South Korea. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because it says South Korea hosted in Doha.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Seoul (1986): row 1\n- Busan (2002): row 4\n\nBut the claim mentions Doha as well, which is incorrect because that's Qatar. So the claim is false because it incorrectly attributes hosting to South Korea in Doha when it's actually Qatar.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul and doha\". So they are saying South Korea hosted in both Seoul and Doha. But from the table, Doha was hosted by Qatar, not South Korea.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because South Korea did not host in Doha; it's Qatar that hosted there. So the only correct hosting location for South Korea beyond one time is Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002), but since the claim includes Doha, which is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. Let me check each row's location:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi (India)\n- 1986: Seoul (South Korea)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (Japan)\n- 1998: Bangkok (Thailand)\n- 2002: Busan (South Korea)\n- 2006: Doha (Qatar)\n- 2010: Guangzhou (China)\n\nSo, South Korea hosted in 1986 and 2002. Therefore, more than once, but not including Doha. So the claim is incorrect because it attributes hosting to South Korea in Doha, which was actually Qatar.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Equestrian at the Asian Game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's stating that Equestrian events were held at each Asian Games, starting in 1982 and occurring every four years up until 2010. So, they should be present in 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different year and location of the Asian Games. There's also a section for gold, silver, and bronze medals. My task is to check if Equestrian events were indeed held in all these years from 1982 to 2010. \n\nTo do this, I need to look at each relevant column in the table. The columns are: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. Since the claim is about Equestrian, which likely corresponds to one of these medal categories, I should check each row's gold, silver, and bronze winners to see if any of them relate to equestrian sports.\n\nWait, but the table might not explicitly mention \"Equestrian\" in the medalist names. So, how can I determine which medals are for Equestrian? Maybe by knowing that Equestrian is a common sport at Asian Games, so it would likely be one of the medal categories\u2014probably gold or bronze since those are more prestigious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes all sports, and I need to check if in each year listed (1982-2010), there's an Equestrian category with winners. But without explicit information about which medal is for Equestrian, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, maybe the way the claim is phrased suggests that Equestrian events have occurred every four years since 1982 up to 2010. So I need to ensure that each of these years has an Equestrian event.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1982: Delhi\n  - Gold: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n  - Silver: Jamila Al-Moutawaa\n  - Bronze: Bariaa Salem Al-Sabbah\n\n- 1986: Seoul\n  - Gold: Takashi Tomura\n  - Silver: Shuichi Toki\n  - Bronze: Ryuzo Okuno\n\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n  - Gold: Konoshin Kuwahara\n  - Silver: Ryuzo Okuno\n  - Bronze: Natya Chantrasmi\n\n- 1998: Bangkok\n  - Gold: Jin Kanno\n  - Silver: Sohn Bong-Gak\n  - Bronze: Quzier Ambak Fathil\n\n- 2002: Busan\n  - Gold: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski\n  - Silver: Lee Jin-Kyung\n  - Bronze: Tadayoshi Hayashi\n\n- 2006: Doha\n  - Gold: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi\n  - Silver: Jasmine Chen-Shao Man\n  - Bronze: Joo Jung-Hyun\n\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n  - Gold: Ramzy Al-Duhami\n  - Silver: Latifa Al-Maktom\n  - Bronze: Khaled Al-Eid\n\nNow, I need to figure out which of these medalists are related to Equestrian. Since the table doesn't specify, perhaps I can infer based on common names or knowledge of sports. For example, some of these names might be from shooting, fencing, martial arts, or other sports.\n\nWait, but without knowing exactly which medals correspond to which sports, this approach might not work. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about the presence of Equestrian in each year, regardless of the medalists. So perhaps I should check if for each of these years (1982-2010), there was an Equestrian event.\n\nBut how can I determine that from the table? Maybe looking at the columns: location, gold, silver, bronze. If any of these are marked as Equestrian winners, but since it's not specified, perhaps it's better to assume that if a year is listed in the table, then an Equestrian event happened.\n\nBut wait, the table only lists years from 1982 to 2010, with locations and medalists. So each of these years had Asian Games, which likely included various sports, including Equestrian. Therefore, the claim that \"Equestrian at the Asian Game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010\" is true because each of those years has an entry in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if all these years have Equestrian medalists, but since the table doesn't specify which medals are for Equestrian, it's hard to confirm. So maybe the relevant cells are all the gold, silver, and bronze columns across these years because each represents a different sport, including possibly Equestrian.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about the occurrence of Equestrian events every four years from 1982-2010. Looking at the table, it lists Asian Games for those years with medalists, which suggests that Equestrian was present each time. So the answer should be TRUE, and all cells in gold, silver, bronze columns from 1982 to 2010 are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is asserting that Equestrian events occurred at each Asian Games held every four years from 1982 through 2010. The table lists these years with corresponding medalists, indicating the presence of various sports, including potentially Equestrian. Since all specified years have entries, it's reasonable to conclude the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"equestrian at the asian game have be locate in a different city every year that it occur except 1994 and 1998.\" So, I need to verify if each year's Asian Games was held in a different city, except for 1994 and 1998 where it might have been the same or had some exception.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, location, gold medalist, silver, and bronze. The relevant columns here are 'year' and 'location'.\n\nI'll go through each year one by one:\n\n1. **1982**: New Delhi - No previous, so different from none.\n2. **1986**: Seoul - Different from 1982.\n3. **1994**: Hiroshima - Same as any before? Let's check if the location for 1994 was new or same as a previous year.\n\nWait, in the table, each row has a unique location per year except possibly for 1994 and 1998.

The claim says \"have been located in a different city every year that it occur except 1994 and 1998.\" So, perhaps implying that those two years might have reused a location. But according to the table, 1994 was Hiroshima, which was new. 1998 was Bangkok, also new.

The claim says: \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time, in Seoul twice.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's about South Korea hosting the equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically mentioning that they did it twice in Seoul.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and location, with columns for gold, silver, and bronze medalists. So, I need to focus on the 'location' column and see which countries have hosted multiple times, especially South Korea.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nNow, the claim mentions South Korea hosting equestrian events more than once, specifically in Seoul twice. From the table, I see that Seoul hosted in 1986. Does it host again elsewhere? Let's check.\n\nLooking for another entry where the location is Seoul. Scanning the 'location' column: New Delhi, Seoul, Hiroshima, Bangkok, Busan, Doha, Guangzhou. Only Seoul appears once. So South Korea (Seoul) hosted in 1986. The claim says they did it twice, but according to the table, it's only once.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another occurrence. Let me double-check the years and locations. No, only one Seoul entry. So the claim states more than once, which isn't supported by the data.\n\nAdditionally, does any other country host multiple times? For example, looking at 2002: Busan hosted, but it's a different year. No duplication there either.\n\nSo, South Korea hasn't hosted equestrian events twice according to this table.

The claim says: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is talking about the gold medalists in the equestrian event at the Asian Games over several years. It's stating that in all those years, the gold medalist was different except for two specific years: 1994 and 1998. That would mean that in every other year listed, the gold medalist changed from the previous year, but in those two years, there might be some consistency.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nThe columns are year, location, gold, silver, bronze. So, each row represents a different year and the corresponding medalists.\n\nI need to focus on the 'gold' column because that's what the claim is about. Let me list out the years and their respective gold medalists:\n\n1982: nadia al - moutawaa\n1986: takashi tomura\n1994: konoshin kuwahara\n1998: jin kanno\n2002: mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski\n2006: ali yousuf al - rumaihi\n2010: ramzy al duhami\n\nNow, I need to check if the gold medalist was different in every year except 1994 and 1998.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n1982: This is the first year, so no previous year to compare. The claim doesn't say anything about before 1982, so it's just a starting point.\n\n1986: Compare with 1982. The gold medalist changed from nadia al - moutawaa to takashi tomura. So, different. That's good according to the claim.\n\n1994: The claim says that except for 1994 and 1998, the gold medalist is different each year. But in 1994, let's see if it's consistent with any prior years. In 1986, we had takashi tomura. Then 1994: konoshin kuwahara. So that's a change. Wait, but the claim says except for 1994 and 1998. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps it's saying that in those two years (1994 and 1998), the gold medalist is different from all other years. But looking at the data:\n\n- 1994: konoshin kuwahara\n- 1998: jin kanno\n\nSo in both 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists are different compared to previous and next years.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if in any of these two years, the gold medalist remained the same as a prior year. But looking at it:\n\n1982: nadia\n1986: takashi (different from 1982)\n1994: konoshin (different from both 1986 and 1998)\n1998: jin (different from 1994)\n2002: mikaela (different from 1998)\n2006: ali (different from 2002)\n2010: ramzy (different from 2006)\n\nSo, each year's gold medalist is different from the one before it. Therefore, in all years, including 1994 and 1998, the gold medalist changed.\n\nWait, but that would mean the claim is saying that only in 1994 and 1998, they are different? That doesn't make sense because all of them are different every year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that except for those two years, the gold medalists were the same. But that's not the case here either because each year has a unique gold medalist.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nSo, the claim is stating that in all years except 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists were different from each other. But wait, if it's saying \"have been different in every year\", except for those two, perhaps meaning that in those two years, they are not different? Or maybe it's trying to say that the only years where the gold medalist changed are 1994 and 1998, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me parse the claim more carefully. It says: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nSo, for all years except 1994 and 1998, the gold medalist was different each year. But from the table, looking at all the years:\n\n1982: first\n1986: different from 1982\n1994: different from 1986\n1998: different from 1994\n2002: different from 1998\n2006: different from 2002\n2010: different from 2006\n\nSo, each year's gold medalist is different from the one before. Therefore, in every year except none, the medalist was different.\n\nBut the claim says except 1994 and 1998. So perhaps that's a mistake? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that only in 1994 and 1998 did the gold medalist change, but that's not correct because all years have different medalists.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The claim is saying that the gold medalists were different every year except for 1994 and 1998. So, in those two years, perhaps they didn't change? But looking at the data:\n\nIn 1982: nadia\n1986: takashi (different from 1982)\n1994: konoshin (different from 1986)\n1998: jin (different from 1994)\nSo, 1994 is different from both before and after. Similarly, 1998 is different.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that except for 1994 and 1998, medalists were different each year is not correct because even in those two years, the medalist changed.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Maybe the claim means that only in 1994 and 1998 did the gold medalist change. But that's not true either, because every year except maybe none has a different medalist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that the gold medalists have been different each year except for those two, meaning that in those two years, they stayed the same as before. But looking at the data:\n\n1994: different from 1986\n1998: different from 1994\n\nSo, no, they didn't stay the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is stating that the gold medalist has been different in every year except for 1994 and 1998. So, the only years where the medalist was not different are 1994 and 1998? But from the table, they are different.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each pair:\n\n1982 vs 1986: different\n1986 vs 1994: different\n1994 vs 1998: different\n1998 vs 2002: different\n2002 vs 2006: different\n2006 vs 2010: different\n\nSo, every consecutive pair is different. Therefore, in all years, the gold medalist has been different.\n\nBut according to the claim, except for 1994 and 1998, they are different. That doesn't align with the data because even those two are different from their neighbors.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that only in 1994 and 1998 did the gold medalist change, but in reality, every year had a different one.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the claim means that for all years except those two, there was no change. So, before 1994 and after 1998, the medalist remained the same. But from the data:\n\nBefore 1986 (1982), it's nadia\nThen in 1986, takashi (change)\nIn 1994, konoshin (change)\nIn 1998, jin (change)\nSo, no, the medalists changed every year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because all years had different medalists. Therefore, the statement that \"except for 1994 and 1998\" is not true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim again. Maybe it's trying to say that in those two years (1994 and 1998), the medalist changed, but in other years, they didn't. But from the data, every year had a change except maybe the first one?\n\nNo, because 1982 is the first year, so there's nothing before it.\n\nWait, I think I need to approach this more methodically.\n\nThe claim: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The gold medalists have been different each year (i.e., every consecutive pair is different)\n- Except for two instances: 1994 and 1998\n\nBut from the data, all consecutive years have different medalists.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement that \"except 1994 and 1998\" is incorrect because even those years had different medalists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim means that in those two years (1994 and 1998), there was a change, but in others, there wasn't. But again, from the data, every year has a change.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false because all years, including 1994 and 1998, had different gold medalists.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to assess whether the claim is correct or not, perhaps the answer is that it's incorrect because even in those two years, the medalist changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is trying to say that only in those two years did the medalist change, but it didn't, so the claim is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see whether all medalists are different, which they are, so the claim's exception is unnecessary because there are no years where the medalist remained the same. Therefore, the claim is incorrect in saying that except for 1994 and 1998, they were different. Because even those two, the medalists changed.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Is the statement correct? No, it's incorrect because all years had different medalists, including 1994 and 1998.\n\nBut I need to check if I'm misinterpreting the claim again. Maybe the claim is trying to say that in those two years, the medalist was not different, but they were.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct in another way.\n\nWait, maybe it's a translation issue or wording problem. The original might have meant something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that except for 1994 and 1998, there were no changes, which is false because all had changes.\n\nSo, conclusion: The statement is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that the gold medalists for equestrian at the Asian Games have been different in every year except for 1994 and 1998. However, examining the data shows that each consecutive year has a different gold medalist, including 1994 and 1998. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is incorrect because all years, including 1994 and 1998, had different gold medalists.",
