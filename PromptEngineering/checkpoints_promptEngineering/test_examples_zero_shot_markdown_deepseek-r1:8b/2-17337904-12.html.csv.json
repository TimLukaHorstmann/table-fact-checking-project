    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the royal house be unavailable for the state cao , chen , song , wey , and yan.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. It seems like the claim is stating that for each of these states (cao, chen, song, wey, yan), there's no corresponding royal house listed in the table. So my task is to check each of these states one by one and see if their rows have any value under the \"royal house\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each state mentioned in the claim: cao, chen, song, wey, yan.\n\nStarting with Cao. In the table, there's a row for cao where type is sovereign, name is yi, title is count, and royal house is empty (-). So yes, for Cao, the royal house is unavailable or missing. That fits the claim.\n\nNext is Chen. The table has two entries for chen: one with xiong yan the elder as name, title viscount, and royal house mi. Another entry for chen, same type, different name, also has a royal house of mi. So both entries for chen have a royal house listed. This contradicts the claim because the claim says they should be unavailable, but in reality, they do have a royal house.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If Chen has a royal house, then the claim is false because it claims the royal house is unavailable for Chen. So already, the claim is incorrect here.\n\nBut let me check the rest just to be thorough.\n\nSong: The table has a row for song, type sovereign, name li, title duke, and royal house is empty (-). So for Song, the royal house is unavailable, which aligns with the claim.\n\nWey: There's a row for wey, type sovereign, name li, title marquis, and royal house is empty (-). So Wey also has no royal house listed, supporting the claim.\n\nYan: The table shows yan with hui as name, title marquis, and royal house is empty (-). So Yan doesn't have a royal house either, which supports the claim.\n\nSo looking at each state:\n\n- Cao: No royal house \u2192 supports claim.\n- Chen: Has royal house \u2192 contradicts claim.\n- Song: No royal house \u2192 supports claim.\n- Wey: No royal house \u2192 supports claim.\n- Yan: No royal house \u2192 supports claim.\n\nSince one of the states (Chen) does have a royal house, the overall claim is false. The presence of Chen having a royal house makes the entire statement incorrect because it's asserting that all five states have unavailable royal houses. But since Chen actually has one, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n]}",

Let me go through each row to see where these names appear.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first column is 'state', which seems to list different royal houses or regions.\n- The second column is 'type', which is always 'sovereign' here.\n- Then we have 'name', 'title', and 'royal house'.\n\nI'm looking for rows where the name is either \"xiong yan the elder\" or \"xiong yong.\" \n\nLet me scan each row:\n\n1. cai - wu, marquis, ji\n2. cao - yi, count, -\n3. chen - you, duke, -\n4. chu - xiong yan the elder, viscount, mi\n5. chu - xiong yong, viscount, mi\n6. jin - jing, marquis, ji\n7. jin - xi, marquis, ji\n8. lu - shen, duke, ji\n9. qi - wu, duke, jiang\n10. qin - marquis, marquis, ying\n11. qin - gongbo, ruler, ying\n12. qin - qin zhong, ruler, ying\n13. song - li, duke, -\n14. wey - li, marquis, -\n15. yan - hui, marquis, -\n\nSo, rows 4 and 5 are the ones that matter here.\n\nRow 4: name is \"xiong yan the elder,\" title is viscount, under state 'chu'.\nRow 5: name is \"xiong yong,\" title is also viscount, again under state 'chu'.\n\nThat means both xiong yan the elder and xiong yong have the title of viscount. So the claim should be true.\n\nI need to check which cells are relevant. Looking at each row:\n\nFor xiong yan the elder: row index 4, columns 'name' and 'title'.\nFor xiong yong: row index 5, same columns.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include both rows 4 and 5, with their respective column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase says that 'wu' is not the Duke title for the states of Chen and Lu. So, I need to look into the table and find out if there's any record where WU is listed as a Duke in Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns: state, type, name, title, and royal house. The claim focuses on two states: Chen and Lu. For each of these states, I need to check their respective entries in the table to see if any of them have a Duke title associated with WU.\n\nLet me go through the table row by row. Starting from state 'cai' up to 'yan'.\n\n1. **Chen State**: Scanning through the rows, I find Chen as the second entry:\n   - State: chen\n   - Type: sovereign\n   - Name: you\n   - Title: duke\n   - Royal house: -\n\nSo, for Chen, the name is 'you' and the title is 'duke'. Now, the claim mentions WU. Is there a row where state is chen and title is Duke with name as WU? From this entry, no, because the name is 'you'.\n\n2. **Lu State**: Looking further down, I find Lu:\n   - State: lu\n   - Type: sovereign\n   - Name: shen\n   - Title: duke\n   - Royal house: ji\n\nHere, the title is Duke with the name 'shen'. Again, no mention of WU. So, for Lu, the Duke title is held by 'shen', not WU.\n\nWait a second, but I should double-check if there are any other entries or perhaps I missed something. Let me scan through all the rows again to ensure I didn't overlook any entry where state is chen or lu and title is duke with name wu.\n\nUpon another review, I don't see any row where:\n- State is either 'chen' or 'lu'\n- Title is 'duke'\n- Name is 'wu'\n\nSo, it seems like WU isn't listed as a Duke for Chen or Lu. Therefore, the claim \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu\" holds true because there's no evidence in the table that WU is a Duke for those states.\n\nI think I've covered all possible entries related to the claim. No other rows seem relevant here.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if 'wu' is listed as a Duke in either Chen or Lu. Scanning through the table, neither state has 'wu' as a Duke title.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" So, I'm looking for two specific titles in the table: \"Duke of Song\" and \"Marquis of Wey,\" and check if their corresponding names are both listed as \"Li.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a state, type, name, title, and royal house. My focus is on rows where the type is \"sovereign\" because the claim refers to titles that likely belong to sovereigns.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **Song**: The state is \"song,\" type is \"sovereign.\" The name is \"li,\" title is \"duke.\" So, \"Duke of Song\" has the name Li.\n2. **Wey**: The state is \"wey,\" type is \"sovereign.\" The name is also listed as \"li,\" but looking at the table, under \"wey,\" the name is \"li\" and title is \"marquis.\" Wait, no\u2014the table shows that under \"wey,\" the title is \"marquis\" with a \"-\", which might mean missing data. So, \"Marquis of Wey\" would correspond to the state \"wey.\"\n\nWait, in the table, for row \"wey,\" the type is \"sovereign,\" name is \"li,\" and title is \"marquis.\" So yes, both titles are associated with the name \"li.\" Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n\nI should check if any other rows might interfere. For example, another state named \"song\" or \"wey\" with different names? But looking through the table, only one row for each \"song\" and \"wey,\" both having \"li\" as their name.\n\nSo, I think the claim is TRUE. Now, to identify relevant cells: any cell that has a title matching either \"duke of song\" or \"marquis of wey.\" From the table:\n\n- For \"song\": row 15 (if starting from 0, but in the provided table, it's around row indices like 14). Wait, let me count the rows properly.\n\nLooking at the markdown table, there are multiple states. The relevant ones are \"song\" and \"wey.\" In the given table:\n\n- \"song\" is listed as a state with name \"li,\" title \"duke.\"\n- \"wey\" is another state with name \"li,\" title \"marquis.\"\n\nSo, their row indices would be where their respective states are. Let me count from 0.\n\nLooking at the provided table:\n\n1. cai\n2. cao\n3. chen\n4. chu (xiong yan)\n5. chu (xiong yong)\n6. jin\n7. lu\n8. qi\n9. qin (marquis)\n10. qin (gongbo)\n11. qin (qin zhong)\n12. song\n13. wey\n14. yan\n\nWait, so \"song\" is row 12 and \"wey\" is row 13.\n\nEach of their relevant cells would be:\n\nFor \"Duke of Song\":\n- row_index: 12 (if starting from 0), but looking at the markdown, the table starts with cai as row 1. Wait, no\u2014the markdown uses |:-------- for columns and each state is a row, so perhaps row indices are 0-based.\n\nWait, in the markdown table:\n\nThe first data row after the header is | cai |... So row index 0 would be cai, then 1: cao, up to 14: song is probably row 13? Let me count:\n\n- 0: cai\n- 1: cao\n- 2: chen\n- 3: chu (xiong yan)\n- 4: chu (xiong yong)\n- 5: jin\n- 6: lu\n- 7: qi\n- 8: qin (marquis)\n- 9: qin (gongbo)\n- 10: qin (qin zhong)\n- 11: song\n- 12: wey\n- 13: yan\n\nSo \"song\" is row 11, and \"wey\" is row 12.\n\nEach of their name cells are relevant because they show the name \"li,\" which matches the claim. So the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For \"Duke of Song\": row index 11, column_name \"name\" (which is \"li\").\n- For \"Marquis of Wey\": row index 12, column_name \"name\" (also \"li\").\n\nWait, no\u2014the titles are different. The claim refers to both titles having the name \"li.\" So the relevant cells would be where title is either \"duke\" or \"marquis,\" and the name is \"li.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should look at the specific titles in the table. Let me check:\n\nIn the table, under each row, the \"title\" column has values like \"marquis,\" \"count,\" etc.\n\nSo for the claim to hold, both the \"duke of song\" and \"marquis of wey\" must have names as \"li.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For \"song\": title is \"duke,\" name is \"li.\" So row 11: state \"song,\" type \"sovereign,\" name \"li,\" title \"duke.\"\n- For \"wey\": title is \"marquis,\" but wait, looking back at the table, under wey, the title is listed as marquis. Wait, no\u2014wait in the table provided by the user:\n\nLooking at the markdown, the line for wey is: | wey | sovereign | li | marquis | - |\n\nYes, so the \"title\" for wey is \"marquis,\" and name is \"li.\"\n\nSo both \"duke of song\" and \"marquis of wey\" have the name \"li.\" Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify relevant cells: for each title in the claim, find their respective row and column.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look at all rows where the title matches either \"duke\" or \"marquis.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For \"duke\": rows are qin (row 8), lu (row 6), qi (row7?), no\u2014wait, looking back, the table shows:\n\nWait, let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps only the name column for each state in question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider that the titles are \"duke\" and \"marquis,\" so we should look at all rows where title is either of those and their names.\n\nSo:\n\n- For \"duke\": row 2 (chen), row 6 (lu), row9 (song)\n   But only song has name li, which matches the claim. So for \"duke of song,\" the relevant cell is row9, column name: 'li'.\n\n- For \"marquis\": rows 0 (cai), 1 (cao?), no\u2014wait:\n\nLooking back, the titles are:\n\nRow 0: cai, title marquis\nRow1: cao, title count\nRow2: chen, title duke\nRow3: chu xiong yan, viscount\nRow4: chu xiong yong, viscount\nRow5: jin, marquis\nRow6: lu, duke\nRow7: qi, count\nRow8: qin (marquis)\nRow9: song, duke\nRow10: wey, marquis\nRow11: yan, prince\n\nSo \"marquis\" titles are in rows 0 (cai),5 (jin),8(qin),10(wey).\n\nOf these, cai's name is wu, jin's name is jing (I think?), qin's name is ?? (probably not li), wey's name is li.\n\nSo for \"marquis of wey,\" the relevant cell is row10, column 'name.'\n\nTherefore, in total, two relevant cells: row9 and row10, column 'name' where the name is 'li'.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n[ (9, 'name'), (10, 'name') ]\n\nBut perhaps we should also include their titles. Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to note that both \"song\" and \"wey\" have 'li' as their names.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants all cells in the table where name is li, regardless of title, then rows9 and10.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer includes these two cells.\n</think>\n\nTo address the task, we need to identify specific cells in a table that contain the name \"li\" for the states \"song\" and \"wey.\" These entries are relevant as they match the criteria provided.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:** The table has columns: state, type, name, title, and royal house. We focus on the \"name\" column.\n2. **Identify Relevant Entries:** Look for rows where the state is either \"song\" or \"wey.\"\n3. **Extract Names:** From these rows, extract the value in the \"name\" column.\n4. **Verify Matches:** Confirm that the extracted names are \"li.\"\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- For state \"song,\" the cell in the \"name\" column is \"li.\"\n- For state \"wey,\" the cell in the \"name\" column is also \"li.\"\n\nTherefore, the specific entries are:\n\n1.

The dash likely indicates no information or that the royal house isn't specified here. So, Cao does not have a royal house listed.\n\n2. **Chen**: Similarly, checking the chen row: type is 'sovereign', name is 'you', title 'duke', and royal house is also '-'. Therefore, Chen doesn't have a royal house.\n\n3. **Song**: The song row has type 'sovereign', name 'li', title 'duke', and royal house '-'. So Song also lacks a specified royal house.\n\n4. **Wey**: For wey, the row shows type 'sovereign', name 'li', title 'marquis', but royal house is '-', meaning no data provided. Hence, Wey doesn't have a royal house.\n\n5. **Yan**: Checking the yan row: type 'sovereign', name 'hui', title 'marquis', and royal house '-'. So Yan also has no specified royal house.\n\nWait a second, in the table provided, all the states mentioned in the claim (cao, chen, song, wey, yan) have their 'royal house' column as '-', which probably means that there's no available or specified data for these states. Therefore, none of them have a royal house according to the table.\n\nThis suggests that the claim is incorrect because each of those states doesn't have an associated royal house listed in the table. So the correct answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that certain states (cao, chen, song, wey, yan) have a royal house available. Upon checking each state's entry in the table, all five have '-' in the 'royal house' column, indicating no data. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list out the relevant cells that support this determination. The claim states: \"the title be viscount for only xiong yan the elder and xiong yong.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's asserting that only two people have the title of viscount: Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong. So my task is to check the table provided and see if this statement holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different individual with various attributes like their state, type (sovereign), name, title, and royal house. My focus should be on the 'title' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: cai, wu - marquis\n   - Title is marquis. Not viscount. So not relevant for the claim.\n\n2. **Row 1**: cao, yi - count\n   - Title is count. Not viscount. Not relevant.\n\n3. **Row 2**: chen, you - duke\n   - Title is duke. Not viscount. Not relevant.\n\n4. **Row 3**: chu, xiong yan the elder - viscount\n   - Title matches viscount. This is one of the two mentioned in the claim.\n\n5. **Row 4**: chu, xiong yong - viscount\n   - Another viscount. This also fits the claim.\n\n6. **Row 5**: jin, jing - marquis\n   - Marquis title. Not relevant.\n\n7. **Row 6**: jin, xi - marquis\n   - Again, marquis. Not relevant.\n\n8. **Row 7**: lu, shen - duke\n   - Duke title. Not viscount. Not relevant.\n\n9. **Row 8**: qi, wu - duke\n   - Duke. Not relevant.\n\n10. **Row 9**: qin, marquis - marquis\n    - Marquis. Not relevant.\n\n11. **Row 10**: qin, gongbo - ruler\n    - Ruler. Not viscount. Not relevant.\n\n12. **Row 11**: qin, qin zhong - ruler\n    - Ruler again. Not relevant.\n\n13. **Row 12**: song, li - duke\n    - Duke. Not relevant.\n\n14. **Row 13**: wey, li - marquis\n    - Marquis. Not relevant.\n\n15. **Row 14**: yan, hui - marquis\n    - Marquis title. Not viscount. Not relevant.\n\nSo after going through each row, I can see that only two people have the title of viscount: Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong. The claim says this is true, so it seems correct at first glance.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there are any other entries with the title 'viscount' that aren't accounted for in the claim. Looking back through each row again:\n\n- Rows 3 and 4 have viscount as their titles.\n- All others don't.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that 'wu' holds the title of Duke for both the state of Chen and Lu. So I need to check if there are any entries in the table where 'wu' is associated with both 'chen' and 'lu' as their titles.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different state, type, name, title, and royal house. The relevant columns for the claim are likely \"name\" and \"title\". So I should focus on these two columns to see if 'wu' is listed as the name with titles Duke for both Chen and Lu.\n\nI'll start by searching for rows where the \"name\" is 'wu'. \n\n- Scanning through the table, in row 0: state=cai, type=sovereign, name=wu, title=marquis, royal house=ji.\n- Then in row 8: state=qi, type=sovereign, name=wu, title=duke, royal house=jiang.\n\nWait, that's only one occurrence where 'wu' is a Duke for Qi. But the claim says 'chen' and 'lu'. So I need to check if 'wu' is also associated with Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking again: Are there any other rows where name='wu'? No, only two entries: one as marquis in cai, another as duke in qi. There's no entry for 'chen' or 'lu' having 'wu' as the name. \n\nSo for Chen, is there a 'wu' associated? Looking through the \"name\" column, I see that row 4 and 5 are about Chu, rows like xiong yan the elder and xiong yong. Then Jin has jing and xi, Lu is at row 7: shen, title=duke, royal house=ji. So Lu's name is 'shen', not 'wu'.\n\nFor Chen, looking through all rows, I don't see any with name='wu'. The closest is the first row, but that's for Cai, not Chen.\n\nThus, the claim is stating that 'wu' is a Duke for both Chen and Lu. But from the table, 'wu' is only associated with Qi as a Duke, and there's no mention of 'wu' being connected to Chen or Lu in any way. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 'wu' is the Duke of both Chen and Lu. However, checking the table reveals 'wu' is only associated with Qi as a Duke, with no entries for Chen or Lu. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what this means. It's stating that \"li\" should not be used as a name exclusively for the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey. So, my task is to check if in the table, the name \"li\" appears only for those two roles.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house. I need to focus on the 'name' column since that's where titles like Duke and Marquis would be listed under their respective states.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **State: cai** - Name: wu, Title: marquis, Royal House: ji\n2. **State: cao** - Name: yi, Title: count, Royal House: -\n3. **State: chen** - Name: you, Title: duke, Royal House: -\n4. **State: chu** - Name: xiong yan the elder, Title: viscount, Royal House: mi\n   Then another entry for Chu with name xiong yong, same title and house.\n5. **State: jin** - Two entries: jing and xi, both marquis, royal house ji.\n6. **State: lu** - Name: shen, Title: duke, Royal House: ji\n7. **State: qi** - Name: wu, Title: duke, Royal House: jiang\n8. **State: qin** - Three entries: marquis, gongbo, and qin zhong, all titled ruler, royal house ying.\n9. **State: song** - Name: li, Title: duke, Royal House: -\n10. **State: wey** - Name: li, Title: marquis, Royal House: -\n\nSo, from this, I see that \"li\" appears in two states: song and wey. Song has a Duke of li, and Wey also has a Marquis of li. Now, the claim says \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" So it's saying that \"li\" should not be used exclusively for those two roles.\n\nWait, but in the table, \"li\" is indeed used exactly for those two: Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. There are no other instances where \"li\" is the name associated with any other title or state. So, the claim says that \"li\" should not be only for those two. But in reality, it is only for them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" Maybe it's trying to say that \"li\" cannot be used as a name for just those two titles. But according to the table, \"li\" is used only for those two, so the statement would be FALSE because \"li\" is indeed the name for exactly those two.\n\nWait no, let me read again: The claim is asserting that \"li\" should not be the name for only those two. So if in reality \"li\" is only for them, then the claim is saying it shouldn't be, which would make the claim FALSE because it actually is used for only those two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: The claim is stating that \"li\" should not be the name for only the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. But in reality, \"li\" is precisely used as their names, so the statement is saying it shouldn't be only those two. So if it's only those two, then the claim is FALSE because it's asserting that it can't be, but it actually is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is suggesting that \"li\" cannot be used for just them, implying there are other uses elsewhere. But in the table, \"li\" is only used for Song and Wey. So the claim's statement would be incorrect because it's asserting a negative that isn't true.\n\nWait no, let me parse the sentence again: \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" The subject is \"li\", verb \"be\", predicate \"not the name for only...\" So it's saying that \"li\" is not a name used exclusively for Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. But in reality, \"li\" is indeed used as their names, so the statement is claiming it isn't, which would be FALSE because it actually is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to check if \"li\" appears only for those two. So the claim is asserting that \"li\" doesn't belong only to them, implying elsewhere, but in reality, it does. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: The claim says \"li be not the name for only...\", meaning that \"li\" cannot be used as a name exclusively for those two. So if \"li\" is indeed used for exactly those two, then the statement would be saying that it's not allowed to be only for them, but in reality, it is, so the claim is wrong.\n\nSo, in conclusion, since \"li\" is used only for Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey, the claim's assertion that \"li be not the name for only...\" is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"li\" cannot be a name exclusively for the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. However, in the table, \"li\" appears only for these two roles. Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly asserts that \"li\" shouldn't be used for them when it actually is.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's start by breaking down the claim and understanding what it says.\n\nThe claim states: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key components of the claim. It seems to be making two main points:\n\n1. The royal house for the state \"jin\" is not \"ji.\"\n2. The state \"jin\" does not have either \"jing\" or \"xi.\"\n\nSo I need to verify both parts based on the table.\n\nLet me look at the table structure again. The table has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house.\n\nI'll go through each row where the state is \"jin.\" From the table:\n\n- Row 1: state cai, type sovereign, name wu, title marquis, royal house ji.\nWait, no, that's for cai. Let me find the rows where state is jin.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 6: state jin, type sovereign, name jing, title marquis, royal house ji.\nRow 7: state jin, type sovereign, name xi, title marquis, royal house ji.\n\nSo there are two entries for state jin.\n\nNow, checking the first part of the claim: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin.\" But in both cases, the royal house is ji. So that seems to contradict the claim. Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"be not ji,\" which would mean it's claiming that the royal house isn't ji. But in reality, it is ji. So this part of the claim is false.\n\nHowever, the second part: \"which do not have either jing and xi.\" The state jin does have both jing (name) and xi (another name). Wait, but the claim says \"do not have either jing and xi,\" meaning that it's asserting that they don't have either. But looking at the table, state jin has both jing and xi as names. So this part is also false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. The term \"either\" can sometimes be a bit tricky. Does \"do not have either jing and xi\" mean that they don't have jing OR they don't have xi? Or does it mean they don't have both?\n\nIn logic terms, \"do not have either\" could mean that for both, the state doesn't have them. So if a state doesn't have jing AND doesn't have xi, then the claim would hold. But in our case, the state jin has both jing and xi as names, so it does have both.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, the \"name\" column is for individual people, not the state. So maybe the confusion is arising from that. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row represents a state with a type (sovereign), a name (person), their title, and their royal house. The same state can have multiple entries if there are different people.\n\nSo for state jin, we have two entries: one with name jing and another with xi. Both have the same royal house, ji.\n\nThe claim says that the royal house is not ji for state jin, which does not have either jing and xi.\n\nWait, but the claim might be mixing up the concepts of titles and names. Let me see:\n\n- The \"name\" column lists individuals. So jing and xi are two different people from the state jin.\n- Their titles are marquis in both cases.\n- Royal house is ji for both.\n\nSo, regarding the first part: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin.\" But it's actually ji, so that's false.\n\nThe second part: \"which do not have either jing and xi.\" Here, the state does have both jing and xi as names, so this is also false.\n\nSo overall, the claim is asserting two things that are incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. Maybe the claim is trying to say that for state jin, the royal house isn't ji, and additionally, state jin doesn't have either of the names jing or xi. But both parts are false because the first part is incorrect (royal house is ji) and the second part is also incorrect (they do have jing and xi).\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim are false, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
