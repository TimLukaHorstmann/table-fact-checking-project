    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"cruzeiro do less well in the recopa sudamericana 1993 than s\u00e3o paulo do.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant parts of the table. The term \"recopa sudamericana\" is one of the columns, specifically column 'recopa sudamericana 1993'. So I need to check both Cruzeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo's performance in that category.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- For Cruzeiro, under 'recopa sudamericana 1993', it says \"runner - up\". That means they were the runners-up.\n- For S\u00e3o Paulo, under the same column, it says \"champions\". So they won it.\n\nThe claim is that Cruzeiro did less well than S\u00e3o Paulo in this competition. Since being a runner-up is better than not winning (as in some teams didn't qualify or got eliminated earlier), Cruzeiro actually performed better than those who didn't make it, but not as good as S\u00e3o Paulo who won.\n\nWait, but the claim is comparing Cruzeiro to S\u00e3o Paulo specifically. So in 'recopa sudamericana 1993', Cruzeiro was runner-up and S\u00e3o Paulo was champions. Runner-up is a higher position than just not qualifying or being eliminated, but it's still not winning. So technically, S\u00e3o Paulo did better (won) than Cruzeiro (runner-up). Therefore, the claim that Cruzeiro \"did less well\" than S\u00e3o Paulo would be true because Cruzeiro didn't win; they only got to the final.\n\nSo I think the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are both for 1993 Recopa Sudamericana under their respective teams.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"flamengo do not reach the final of any tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that Flamengo did NOT reach the final of ANY tournament in 1993. So I should look at the row for Flamengo in the 1993 tournaments and see if they made it to any finals.\n\nLooking at the table, the team is \"flamengo.\" Scanning through each column:\n\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Runner-up (which I think means they made it to the final)\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: N/A, which might mean they didn't participate or it's unknown\n- Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A\n\nWait, in the Supercopa Sudamericana 1993 column for Flamengo, it says \"runner-up.\" Runner-up implies that they were in the final because the runner-up is the team that lost to the champion. So if they were runners-up, they did reach the final.\n\nSo in this case, Flamengo made it to at least one final (the Supercopa Sudamericana 1993). That means the claim \"flamengo do not reach the final of any tournament\" is false because they did reach a final.\n\nI should double-check if there are other columns where they might have reached the final, but in this table, for 1993, only the Supercopa Sudamericana shows them as runners-up. So that's enough to disprove the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"super copa sudamericana 1993\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"santos did not qualify for as many tournament as cruzeiro do\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Santos didn't qualify for as many tournaments as Cruzeiro did. So, I need to compare how many times each team qualified for various tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the 'santos' and 'cruzeiro' rows, checking each tournament they participated in.\n\nFor Cruzeiro:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Quarterfinals (so they qualified)\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: Runner-up (qualified)\n- Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A\n\nSo, Cruzeiro qualified for Supercopa Sudamericana and Recopa Sudamericana. That's two tournaments.\n\nFor Santos:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Round of 16 (qualified)\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: N/A\n- Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A\n\nSo, Santos qualified for Supercopa Sudamericana. That's one tournament.\n\nThe claim says \"santos did not qualify for as many tournament as cruzeiro do.\" Since Cruzeiro qualified for two tournaments and Santos only one, the statement is comparing how many times each didn't qualify versus their participation. Wait, actually, maybe I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the claim is about how many tournaments they DID NOT QUALIFY for. So, \"santos did not qualify for as many tournament as cruzeiro do.\" Does this mean that Santos didn't qualify in more tournaments than Cruzeiro?\n\nLooking at each team's number of times they didn't qualify:\n\nFor Cruzeiro:\n- Copa Libertadores: Did not qualify\n- Copa Conmebol: Did not qualify\nSo, two times they did not qualify.\n\nFor Santos:\n- Copa Libertadores: Did not qualify\n- Copa Conmebol: Did not qualify\nAgain, two times they did not qualify.\n\nWait, both teams didn't qualify for two tournaments each. So the number is equal. But the claim says \"santos did not qualify for as many tournament as cruzeiro do,\" which seems to imply that Santos didn't qualify in more than Cruzeiro, but they have the same number.\n\nSo, if the claim is stating that Santos didn't qualify for more tournaments than Cruzeiro, but they both didn't qualify for two each, then the statement is FALSE because it's not true that Santos didn't qualify for more than Cruzeiro. They qualified for the same number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The claim could be interpreted as the total number of tournaments they didn't qualify for. For both teams, it's two each, so the claim is incorrect because they have the same count.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"coppa conmebol 1993\"}]}",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim says only one team participated in the Intercontinental Cup in 1993. So first, I should look at the column for the Intercontinental Cup to see which teams played. In the table provided, there's a column named \"intercontinental cup 1993\". Let me check each row under this column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: n / a\n- Botafogo: n / a\n- Bragantino: n / a\n- Cruzeiro: n / a\n- Flamengo: n / a\n- Fluminense: n / a\n- Gr\u00eamio: n / a\n- Internacional: n / a\n- Santos: n / a\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: champions\n- Vasco: n / a\n\nWait, so only two teams have something in the \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. Both have either 'n / a' or specific results like champions. But wait, is it possible that some teams didn't participate, hence 'n / a', while others did?\n\nWait no, the claim is about whether only one team played in the Intercontinental Cup. So I need to see if only one team actually took part, not just the result. Let me check each cell again.\n\nLooking at \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: n / a\nThis could mean they didn't qualify or it's unknown.\nBotafogo: n / a\nBragantino: n / a\nCruzeiro: n / a\nFlamengo: n / a\nFluminense: n / a\nGr\u00eamio: n / a\nInternacional: n / a\nSantos: n / a\nVasco: n / a\n\nWait, only S\u00e3o Paulo has 'champions' in that column. So does that mean only S\u00e3o Paulo played in the Intercontinental Cup? Or did others not play?\n\nBut wait, the term \"n / a\" might stand for 'not applicable' or 'did not participate'. So if most teams have n/a, maybe only one team actually participated.\n\nHowever, looking at other columns, like the Super Copa Sudamericana 1993 and others, several teams did qualify. For example, Cruzeiro made it to the quarterfinals in the Super Copa, Flamengo was a runner-up there, etc. So the Intercontinental Cup might have been a different competition.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure: The claim is about the Intercontinental Cup 1993. From the table, only S\u00e3o Paulo has a result there\u2014champions. All others have n/a. So does that mean only S\u00e3o Paulo played? That would mean only one team participated, making the claim TRUE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The column name is \"intercontinental cup 1993\". Did all the teams with n/a not play, and only S\u00e3o Paulo did? Or perhaps it's possible that more than one team played but their results are unknown or not shown?\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row shows the performance of a team in each competition. So for example, Cruzeiro didn't qualify for the Intercontinental Cup 1993, hence n/a.\n\nBut if only S\u00e3o Paulo is listed as having participated (champions), then only one team played.

Let me start by understanding the claim: \"cruzeiro be the champion over s\u00e3o paulo in recopa sudamericana 1993.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the table provided. The key elements here are \"cruzeiro,\" \"s\u00e3o paulo,\" and \"recopa sudamericana 1993.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team, and each column corresponds to different competitions in 1993. Specifically, there's a column for \"recopa sudamericana 1993.\" So I need to check that column to see how both Cruzeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo performed.\n\nCruzeiro's performance in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993 is listed as \"runner - up,\" which means they were the second-place finishers, not champions. On the other hand, S\u00e3o Paulo achieved \"champions\" status in that competition.\n\nThe claim states that Cruzeiro was the champion over S\u00e3o Paulo in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993. However, according to the table, Cruzeiro didn't win; instead, S\u00e3o Paulo did. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it reverses their positions in that particular competition.\n\nNext, I need to pinpoint which cells are relevant. For Cruzeiro, their row index is 4 (since the table starts at 0: atl\u00e9tico mineiro is row 0, and so on). The relevant column for Recopa Sudamericana is \"recopa sudamericana 1993,\" so that's the cell at row_index 4, column_name \"recopa sudamericana 1993.\"\n\nSimilarly, S\u00e3o Paulo is in row index 9. So their relevant cell is also in the same column: row_index 9 and \"recopa sudamericana 1993.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is false because Cruzeiro did not win but was a runner-up, and S\u00e3o Paulo won.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"8 team fail to qualify for the copa libertadores.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the column named \"copa libertadores 1993\" because that's directly related to whether teams qualified for the Copa Libertadores in 1993. Each row represents a different team and their performance in that specific tournament.\n\nI'll go through each team one by one:\n\n1. **Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro**: It says \"did not qualify.\" So that's a failure.\n2. **Botafogo**: Also \"did not qualify.\"\n3. **Bragantino**: Same as above, didn't qualify.\n4. **Cruzeiro**: They didn't qualify either.\n5. **Flamengo**: Wait, Flamengo has \"quarterfinals.\" That means they did qualify, right? So they made it to the quarter stage but didn't go further. But in terms of qualifying for the tournament, if reaching the quarterfinals implies qualification, then Flamengo did qualify. However, some might argue that \"did not qualify\" refers specifically to not making the tournament at all.\n6. **Fluminense**: They didn't qualify.\n7. **Gr\u00eamio**: Again, \"did not qualify.\"\n8. **Internacional**: They were in the \"group stage.\" So they did make it past the initial group stages but perhaps got eliminated after that. Still, that means they qualified for the tournament.\n9. **Santos**: They didn't qualify.\n10. **S\u00e3o Paulo**: They are champions, so definitely they qualified and won the tournament.\n11. **Vasco**: \"Did not qualify.\"\n\nNow, I need to count how many teams did NOT qualify. Let's list them out:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: No\n- Botafogo: No\n- Bragantino: No\n- Cruzeiro: No\n- Flamengo: Hmm, this is tricky. If \"quarterfinals\" means they qualified, then they didn't fail. But if \"did not qualify\" specifically refers to not being in the tournament at all, then maybe they did not qualify. I need to consider how to interpret this.\n- Fluminense: No\n- Gr\u00eamio: No\n- Internacional: They were in group stage, so they qualified.\n- Santos: No\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: Yes, they qualified and won.\n- Vasco: No\n\nWait, the claim is about 8 teams failing. Let's count the \"did not qualify\" entries.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro - Did not qualify (yes)\n2. Botafogo - Did not qualify\n3. Bragantino - Did not qualify\n4. Cruzeiro - Did not qualify\n5. Flamengo - Quarterfinals, so they qualified, so no.\n6. Fluminense - Did not qualify\n7. Gr\u00eamio - Did not qualify\n8. Internacional - Group stage, so yes.\n9. Santos - Did not qualify\n10. S\u00e3o Paulo - Champions, yes.\n11. Vasco - Did not qualify\n\nSo the teams that did NOT qualify are:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro (1)\n- Botafogo (2)\n- Bragantino (3)\n- Cruzeiro (4)\n- Fluminense (5)\n- Gr\u00eamio (6)\n- Santos (7)\n- Vasco (8)\n\nThat's 8 teams. Wait, but Flamengo and Internacional qualify, so they are not in the \"did not qualify\" list. So yes, exactly 8 teams failed to qualify.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"8 team fail.\" So if there are exactly 8 teams that did not qualify, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The relevant column is \"copa libertadores 1993\" because it shows whether each team qualified or not. Therefore, for each of those 8 teams, their corresponding cell in this column is \"did not qualify.\"\n\nSo, I'll list the row indices (from 0 to 10) and the column name for these 8 teams.\n\nRow 0: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro - did not qualify\nRow 1: Botafogo - did not qualify\nRow 2: Bragantino - did not qualify\nRow 3: Cruzeiro - did not qualify\nRow 5: Fluminense - did not qualify\nRow 6: Gr\u00eamio - did not qualify\nRow 8: Santos - did not qualify\nRow 10: Vasco - did not qualify\n\nWait, in the table provided, let me check each row's index:\n\nLooking at the markdown table:\n\n1. Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro - row 0\n2. Botafogo - row 1\n3. Bragantino - row 2\n4. Cruzeiro - row 3\n5. Flamengo - row 4\n6. Fluminense - row 5\n7. Gr\u00eamio - row 6\n8. Internacional - row 7\n9. Santos - row 8\n10. S\u00e3o Paulo - row 9\n11. Vasco - row 10\n\nSo the 8 teams that did not qualify are rows 0,1,2,3,5,6,8,10.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row 0: copa libertadores 1993\n- row 1: same column\n- row 2: same\n- row 3: same\n- row 5: same\n- row 6: same\n- row 8: same\n- row 10: same\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because exactly 8 teams did not qualify, and the relevant cells are all in \"copa libertadores 1993\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the columns: copa libertadores 1993, supercopa sudamericana 1993, copa conmebol 1993, recopa sudamericana 1993, and intercontinental cup 1993.\n\nWait, but 'flamengo' is one of the teams in the table. I need to see where they placed in each tournament. So for each column, I'll look at flamengo's performance.\n\nStarting with copa libertadores 1993: The entry says 'quarterfinals.' That means they didn't reach the final; they were eliminated before that.\n\nNext, supercopa sudamericana 1993: The entry is 'runner - up.' Hmm, runner-up implies they made it to the final but lost. So in this tournament, they did reach the final.\n\nCopa conmebol 1993: Flamengo didn't qualify, so they weren't in the competition. That means they definitely didn't reach the final here.\n\nRecaupa sudamericana 1993: It's 'n / a,' which I think stands for not applicable or maybe didn't participate.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"santos and cruzeiro qualify for the same number of tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which teams we're talking about: Santos and Cruzeiro. Looking at the table, both are among the listed clubs. Now, I need to check how many tournaments each of them qualified for in 1993.\n\nThe relevant columns for qualification would be \"copa libertadores 1993,\" \"superliga sudamericana 1993,\" \"copa conmebol 1993,\" and maybe others like \"recopa sudamericana\" or \"intercontinental cup.\" However, the claim is about \"qualifying for the same number of tournaments,\" which I assume refers to their performance in each tournament they participated in.\n\nStarting with Santos:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify.\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Round of 16. So that's one participation, but did they actually qualify? \"Round of 16\" might mean they made it past the initial stage, so they qualified for at least that round.\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify.\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: N/A, which I think means they didn't participate.\n- Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A. So Santos participated in two tournaments in 1993: Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana.\n\nNow for Cruzeiro:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify.\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Quarterfinals, so they qualified.\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify.\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: Runner-up. So that's another participation.\n- Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A.\n\nSo Cruzeiro participated in three tournaments: Supercopa Sudamericana, their own Copa Libertadores (wait, no, they didn't qualify for Copa Libertadores), wait. Let me correct that. Wait, Cruzeiro didn't qualify for Copa Libertadores, so their participations are:\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Quarterfinals.\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: Runner-up.\n\nWait, is the Recopa Sudamericana considered a separate tournament? If so, that's two tournaments. But I'm not sure if in 1993 they might have participated elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the Intercontinental Cup counts as another, but it shows N/A for both, meaning they didn't participate there.\n\nWait, no: For Cruzeiro, under intercontinental cup 1993, it's N/A, so they didn't qualify or participate in that one. So their participations are two tournaments: Supercopa Sudamericana and Recopa Sudamericana.\n\nBut wait, Recopa Sudamericana is a separate competition from the main ones. It's an annual competition between the champions of the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Conmebol (usually). So if Cruzeiro was runner-up in Recopa Sudamericana 1993, that would count as one more participation.\n\nSo, let me tally:\n\nSantos:\n1. Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify.\n2. Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Round of 16 \u2013 qualified.\n3. Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify.\n4. Recopa Sudamericana 1993: N/A \u2013 didn't participate.\n5. Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A.\n\nSo, Santos participated in 1 tournament.\n\nCruzeiro:\n1. Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify.\n2. Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Quarterfinals \u2013 qualified.\n3. Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify.\n4. Recopa Sudamericana 1993: Runner-up \u2013 participated.\n5. Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A.\n\nSo, Cruzeiro participated in 2 tournaments.\n\nTherefore, Santos participated in 1 tournament, and Cruzeiro participated in 2. That means they didn't qualify for the same number of tournaments; Santos had one, Cruzeiro had two.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding \"qualify.\" Does it mean making it to a certain stage, or just being eligible to participate? For example, if a team doesn't qualify, they don't participate. So in that case:\n\nSantos:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify \u2192 didn't participate.\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Round of 16 \u2192 participated.\n- Others: No.\n\nSo one participation.\n\nCruzeiro:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify \u2192 didn't participate.\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Quarterfinals \u2192 participated.\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: Runner-up \u2192 participated.\n- Others: No.\n\nSo two participations.\n\nThus, they qualified for different numbers of tournaments. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if \"qualify\" refers to something else, like making it to a specific stage or being eligible. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about how many times they qualified across all tournaments, but that might complicate things further. However, based on my analysis, Santos participated in one, Cruzeiro in two.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on the number of tournaments each team qualified for in 1993. Santos participated in one tournament (Supercopa Sudamericana), while Cruzeiro participated in two (Supercopa Sudamericana and Recopa Sudamericana). Therefore, they did not qualify for the same number.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"superliga sudamericana\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"4 teams play in the intercontinental cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should check which column in the table corresponds to the Intercontinental Cup 1993. Looking at the markdown table, there's a column named \"intercontinental cup 1993\". That must be the one we're interested in for this part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many teams participated in that specific competition. The table lists several teams and their performance in different tournaments. For the Intercontinental Cup 1993, each team has a status associated with it. Let me look through each row:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: n / a\n- Botafogo: n / a\n- Bragantino: n / a\n- Cruzeiro: n / a\n- Flamengo: n / a\n- Fluminense: n / a\n- Gr\u00eamio: n / a\n- Internacional: n / a\n- Santos: n / a\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: champions\n- Vasco: n / a\n\nSo, only two teams have some status listed: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro and Vasco both have \"n / a\", which likely stands for 'not applicable' or 'did not qualify'. However, S\u00e3o Paulo is marked as champions. Wait, that's just one team.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"4 teams play in the intercontinental cup.\" So, if only two teams qualified (S\u00e3o Paulo being the champion and maybe others), but the table shows more teams with n/a or other statuses like group stage, quarterfinals, etc., perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no. The column is \"intercontinental cup 1993,\" so perhaps each entry here represents whether the team participated in that specific competition. If a team's cell is \"n / a\", does that mean they didn't participate? Or maybe it's their performance status.\n\nI think the key point is to count how many teams have a non-\"n / a\" entry in the \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column because that would indicate participation. But looking at the data, most entries are \"n / a,\" which might mean they didn't participate or it's not applicable for some reason.\n\nWait, no, I think \"n / a\" actually refers to the status of their participation. For example, if a team didn't qualify, it would say \"did not qualify.\" So perhaps in this context, \"intercontinental cup 1993\" is a competition where only certain teams participated.\n\nLooking again: only S\u00e3o Paulo has \"champions,\" which likely means they won it. But the other entries are mostly \"n / a\" or \"did not qualify.\" So maybe only one team participated? Or perhaps more.\n\nWait, let me check each row's \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: n / a\n- Botafogo: n / a\n- Bragantino: n / a\n- Cruzeiro: n / a\n- Flamengo: n / a\n- Fluminense: n / a\n- Gr\u00eamio: n / a\n- Internacional: n / a\n- Santos: n / a\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: champions\n- Vasco: n / a\n\nSo, only S\u00e3o Paulo has an entry other than \"n / a.\" That suggests that only one team participated in the Intercontinental Cup 1993. Therefore, the claim that \"4 teams play\" would be false because it's just S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the \"intercontinental cup 1993\" was a different competition where more teams played. Alternatively, perhaps the table is misaligned or I'm not interpreting it correctly.\n\nWait another thought: in some tournaments, like the Intercontinental Cup, usually, two teams play each other annually. So, if that's the case, maybe only one match happened with two teams. But looking at the data, S\u00e3o Paulo is marked as champions, implying they won. So perhaps only one team participated because it's a single match? Or maybe the competition had more than four teams.\n\nBut according to the table, in 1993, only S\u00e3o Paulo has an entry indicating participation. Therefore, the claim that \"4 teams play\" would be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"4 teams play in the intercontinental cup\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant data in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Column**: The column corresponding to the Intercontinental Cup 1993 is crucial for verifying the claim. From the table, this column is labeled as \"intercontinental cup 1993\".\n\n2. **Analyze Each Team's Participation**: We look at each team's status in the \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column:\n   - Most teams have either \"did not qualify\", \"n / a\" (not applicable), or specific performance statuses like \"champions\".\n   - Only S\u00e3o Paulo is marked as having \"champions\", indicating participation and victory.\n   - All other teams do not have an entry that suggests they participated in the Intercontinental Cup 1993.\n\n3. **Count Participating Teams**: Based on the data, only one team (S\u00e3o Paulo) has a non-\"n / a\" status in the Intercontinental Cup 1993 column. This indicates that only one team participated.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim that \"4 teams play in the intercontinental cup\" is false because only one team (S\u00e3o Paulo) participated in the competition.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n**Relevant Cells**: Only the cell for S\u00e3o Paulo in the \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column is relevant. However, since it's the only non-\"n / a\" entry, it directly contradicts the claim of four teams playing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
