    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"On 2 May 1999, the surface be hard.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. Each row represents an event with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific date, 2 May 1999, so my first step is to find the corresponding row in the table where the date matches this. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. First row: date is \"2 may 1999\" \u2013 that's our target.\n2. Next rows have different dates like July 1999, February 2000, etc.\n\nSo, the relevant row is the first one (row_index: 0). \n\nNow, the claim mentions the surface being hard. I need to check what the surface was for this event. Looking at the 'surface' column in the first row: it says \"hard.\" That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data. There's no contradiction or missing information here. \n\nSo, after verifying each part of the claim against the corresponding cells in the table, I can confidently say the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Mirielle Dittmann is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Mirielle Dittmann be the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see if it matches any entries in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions \"opponent in the final,\" so I should focus on the column headers. From the table, there are columns like 'opponent in final,' 'surface,' 'date,' and 'location.'\n\nI need to find a row where:\n1. The opponent in the final is Mirielle Dittmann.\n2. The surface is hard.\n3. The date is 6 February 2000.\n4. The location is Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check these conditions.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Winner on 2 May 1999 in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico on hard surface. Opponent is Candice Jairala.\n- Row 1: Winner on 11 July 1999 in Felixstowe, England on grass. Opponent Karen Nugent.\n- Row 2: Runner-up on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, NZ on hard. Opponent Mirielle Dittmann. The surface is hard and the location is Wellington, but this row's outcome is runner-up, not winner. So opponent here is Mirielle, which matches part of the claim.\n- Row 3: Runner-up on 28 May 2000 in El Paso, USA on hard. Opponent Erin Burdette.\n- Row 4: Runner-up on 14 Sept 2003 in Spoleto, Italy on clay. Opponent Lenka Snajdrova.\n- Row 5: Winner on 6 Feb 2005 in Wellington, NZ on hard. Opponent Mirielle Dittmann. Here, the surface is hard, location is Wellington, opponent is Mirielle, and outcome is winner.\n- Wait, but the claim's date is 6 February 2000, not 2005. So row 2 is about Feb 2000, which might be relevant.\n\nBut in row 2, the outcome is runner-up, not a winner. The claim says \"opponent in the final,\" implying they were the finalist but didn't win. However, sometimes the term 'final' can refer to just being part of the final match regardless of winning or losing. But I'm not sure if that's how it's used here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim is about Mirielle Dittmann being the opponent in the final on a specific date and location. So looking for rows where she is the opponent, regardless of whether they won.\n\nIn row 2: Yes, she is the opponent, but outcome is runner-up.\nIn row 5: Opponent is Mirielle, and outcome is winner. But the date here is 6 Feb 2005, not 2000.\n\nSo the claim's date is 6 Feb 2000. The only relevant row is row 2, where she was the opponent in the final on hard surface in Wellington, NZ on that date. However, the outcome there is runner-up, not winner. But does it matter? The claim doesn't specify whether she won or lost; it just says she was the opponent.\n\nWait, but let me check if the term 'opponent in the final' implies being a participant regardless of outcome. So yes, she was part of the final as runner-up on that date and location with hard surface.\n\nSo all four conditions are met in row 2: opponent is Mirielle, date is 6 Feb 2000, location Wellington NZ, surface hard.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because the table supports it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in the table, specifically row 2. All specified conditions match this row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the opponent in final on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand on hard surface be katerina kramperov\u00e1.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions the \"opponent in final\" for a specific date (6 February 2000), location (Wellington, New Zealand), and surface type (hard). The name given is Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. My task is to find the row that matches all the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet's go through each relevant column one by one.\n\n1. **Outcome**: The claim mentions \"opponent in final,\" which suggests it's looking for a runner-up or the losing side of the final match. In the table, the \"outcome\" column has two options: \"winner\" and \"runner - up.\" Since the opponent is the runner-up, I need to look at rows where outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n\n2. **Date**: The claim specifies 6 February 2000. Scanning through the date column:\n   - Row 0: 2 May 1999\n   - Row 1: 11 July 1999\n   - Row 2: 6 February 2000 \u2192 This matches.\n   - Row 3: 28 May 2000\n   - Row 4: 14 September 2003\n   - Row 5: 6 February 2005\n   - Row 6: 28 August 2005\n   - Row 7: 5 February 2006\n   - Row 8: 12 February 2006\n   - Row 9: 20 April 2008\n\n   Only row 2 has the date 6 February 2000.\n\n3. **Location**: The claim says Wellington, New Zealand. Checking the location column:\n   - Row 2: Wellington, New Zealand \u2192 This matches.\n   \n4. **Surface**: Hard surface is specified. Looking at the surface column:\n   - Row 2: hard \u2192 Matches.\n\n5. **Opponent in Final**: The opponent's name should be Katerina Kramperov\u00e1. Checking this column:\n   - Row 2: katerina kramperova (Note: there's a slight difference in spelling, but it's likely the same person.)\n   \nPutting all these together, row 2 matches all the criteria mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the opponent in the final on that specific date and location with a hard surface is indeed Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the dates:\n\n- The first entry is May 2, 1999. That's exactly the date we're looking for.\n\nNext, I need to check what the surface was on that specific row. Looking at the same row under the 'surface' column:\n\n- It says \"hard\". Hmm, that's not grass. So the surface wasn't grass; it was hard.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each row again.\n\nRow 0: May 2, 1999, coatzacoalcos, Mexico, hard surface. Opponent Candice Jairala, score is 3-6, etc. So the surface here is definitely hard, not grass.\n\nNo other rows have that specific date. The next closest is July 11, 1999, but that's a different date and location.\n\nSo, the claim says the surface was grass on May 2, 1999, but according to the table, it was hard.
