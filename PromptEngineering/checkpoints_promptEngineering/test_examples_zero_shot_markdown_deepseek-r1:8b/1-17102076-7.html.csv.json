    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific game's score is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the score of game 35 be l90 - 98 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the table structure and figuring out how the information is presented. The table has several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game 35\", so my first step is to locate row 35 in the table. I'll scan through each row until I find game number 35. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- Game 33: January 2 vs Detroit\n- Game 34: January 3 vs Indiana\n- Game 35: January 5 vs New Jersey\n\nSo, game 35 is indeed listed on January 5 against the New Jersey team. Next, I need to check the \"score\" column for this specific game. \n\nIn row 35 (game number 35), under the score column, it says \"l90 - 98 (ot)\". That matches exactly what the claim states: l90 - 98 (ot). There's an 'ot' in parentheses, which I assume stands for overtime, as that's a common notation in sports scores to indicate the game went into overtime.\n\nNow, comparing this with the claim. The claim specifies \"the score of game 35 be l90 - 98 (ot)\". Since the table confirms that game 35 has a score of l90 - 98 (ot), there's no discrepancy here. \n\nI should also consider if any other columns might affect this verification, but for the purpose of this claim, only the \"score\" column is relevant because it directly addresses what the claim is stating.\n\nTherefore, after verifying both the game number and the score in the table, I can confidently say that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
