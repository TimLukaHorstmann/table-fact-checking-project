    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"with a final score of 75 - 86, b shaw have 5 assist.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see what each part refers to. The table has several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, series. Each row represents a different game with specific stats.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: the final score of 75 - 86 and that b shaw had 5 assists in that game. So I need to find the corresponding row where the score is 75-86 and check if b shaw's assists are 5.\n\nLooking at the table, let's scan each row for a score of 75 - 86. The first row has a score of l 75 - 86. Wait, the 'l' before 75 probably stands for loss. So that game was a loss with a final score of 75-86.\n\nNow, in that same row, under high assists, it says b shaw (5). That matches because the claim states b shaw had 5 assists. So both parts of the claim are supported by this row.\n\nI should also make sure there's no other game with a similar score or same player stats, but since each row is for a different game, and the only game with that exact score is row 0 (index 0), it's clear that b shaw indeed had 5 assists in that game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the game with a final score of 75-86 and check B Shaw's assist count. The first row matches both criteria:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Final Score:** Locate the game with a score of 75 - 86. This is found in row 0 (index 0).\n2. **Check B Shaw's Assists:** In row 0, under \"high assists,\" B Shaw is recorded as having 5 assists.\n3. **Conclusion:** Both parts of the claim are verified by row 0's data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE, supported by relevant cells in row 0.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the location attendance for the 1 - 1 be boston garden.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let's break it down.\n\nThe key elements are:\n1. \"location attendance\" \u2013 This refers to the venue where the game was played.\n2. \"for the 1 - 1\" \u2013 This likely refers to a specific series outcome or something similar. Looking at the table, I see a 'series' column that has values like \"0 - 1\", \"1 - 1\", etc. So, \"1 - 1\" probably refers to the series record after two games.\n3. \"be boston garden\" \u2013 This is the location, so we're checking if the attendance was at Boston Garden for a game where the series stood at 1-1.\n\nNow, I'll look into the table to find the relevant rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the 'series' column:\n- Row 0: 0 - 1\n- Row 1: 1 - 1\n- Row 2: 2 - 1\n- Row 3: 2 - 2\n- Row 4: 2 - 3\n\nThe claim refers to the \"1 - 1\" series, which is row 1.\n\nNext, I'll check the 'location attendance' column for row 1. From the table:\nRow 1 has a location of \"boston garden.\"\n\nSo, in this case, both conditions are met: the series is 1-1 (row 1) and the location attendance is at Boston Garden. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure there are no discrepancies or other factors that might affect this conclusion. The table shows for row 1, game details include a win against the Pistons with a score of 109-103, but the series was tied at 1-1. The location is indeed Boston Garden, matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because the series was 1-1 and the location attendance for that game was at Boston Garden.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find all games that took place at Boston Garden. Scanning each row:\n\n- Game 1: May 7 at Detroit Pistons vs. Boston Celtics (location is Boston Garden)\n- Game 2: May 9 at Detroit Pistons vs. Boston Celtics (Boston Garden)\n- Game 3: May 11 at The Palace of Auburn Hills (not Boston Garden)\n- Game 4: May 13 at The Palace of Auburn Hills (same location as game 3)\n- Game 5: May 15 at Boston Garden\n\nSo, the games at Boston Garden are games 1, 2, and 5. I need to check the series record for these games.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\nGame 1:\n- Series is 0 - 1. So before game 1, the Pistons were 0-1 in the series.\n\nAfter Game 1: They lost, so series went to 0 - 2? Wait, no\u2014the series after game 1 would be 0-1 because it's 0-1 after one loss.\n\nWait, the series column shows for each game how the team's record is after that game. So for game 1, since they lost (denoted by 'l'), their series goes to 0 - 1. Game 2: They won, so series becomes 1 - 1. Game 5: They lost again, making it 2 - 3.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the game at Boston Garden having a series record of 5-2. That doesn't make sense because in the table, after all games, the Pistons ended with a series record of 2 - 3.\n\nLooking specifically at the three Boston Garden games (1, 2, 5):\n\nAfter Game 1: 0 - 1\nAfter Game 2: 1 - 1\nAfter Game 5: 2 - 3\n\nSo the series record after each game at Boston Garden is:\n\n- After Game 1: 0 - 1 (row index 1)\n- After Game 2: 1 - 1 (row index 2)\n- After Game 5: 2 - 3 (row index 5)\n\nThe claim says the series record is 5 - 2, which doesn't match any of these. The highest series they reached at Boston Garden was 1 - 1 after game 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's about the series before a specific game? Or the overall series?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to the Pistons' series record when playing at Boston Garden across all games, but that would require summing their wins and losses in those specific games.\n\nLooking at the three games:\n\nGame 1: loss (0 - 1)\nGame 2: win (1 - 1)\nGame 5: loss (2 - 3)\n\nSo total in Boston Garden: 1 win, 2 losses. Series record would be 1-2. But that's not 5-2 either.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is misinterpreted. Maybe it's about the location attendance or something else. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the 'series' column in each relevant row:\n\nGame 1: series is 0 - 1\nGame 2: series is 1 - 1\nGame 5: series is 2 - 3\n\nNone of these show a 5 - 2 series. The highest series after game 5 was 2-3.\n\nSo the claim is that at Boston Garden, their series record is 5-2, which isn't supported by any row in the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the data provided in the table. After checking each relevant game, none show a series record of 5 - 2 for the Detroit Pistons at Boston Garden.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
