    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"3 of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe term \"member of the great midwest conference\" refers to universities that are part of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). Looking at the table provided, it lists several universities with their nicknames and other details like founding year, type, enrollment, etc. \n\nNow, the claim is about three of these members having been founded before 1860. So I need to check each university in the table to see when they were founded and then count how many are before 1860.\n\nLooking at the \"founded\" column:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819 (before 1860)\n- University of Dayton: 1850 (just before 1860)\n- DePaul University: 1898 (after 1860)\n- Marquette University: 1881 (after 1860)\n- University of Memphis: 1912 (after 1860)\n- Saint Louis University: 1818 (before 1860)\n\nWait, that's two universities before 1860: Cincinnati and St. Louis. But the claim says three. Did I miss any? Let me double-check each row.\n\nYes, only two universities in the table have a founded year before 1860: Cincinnati (1819) and St. Louis (1818). The University of Dayton was founded in 1850, which is just one year before 1860, so technically still before. So that's three universities: Cincinnati, Dayton, and St. Louis.\n\nWait, no, the table shows:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819\n- Saint Louis University: 1818\n- University of Dayton: 1850\n\nThat makes three universities founded before 1860. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because there are three members (Cincinnati, Dayton, and St. Louis) that were founded before 1860.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer is TRUE, with relevant cells being the rows for these three universities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 2 institution locate within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. Two institutions.\n2. Both located in Ohio.\n3. Both members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC).\n\nLooking at the table, there are five institutions listed: University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, DePaul University, Marquette University, and Saint Louis University. Each row has details like nickname, location, founded year, type, enrollment, joined, and left.\n\nI need to check which of these institutions are located in Ohio because the claim says both should be within Ohio. From the table:\n- University of Cincinnati is in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n- University of Dayton is also in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nSo that's two institutions already. Next, I need to see if both of these are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). Wait, but looking at the table columns, I don't see any column related to conference affiliation or membership. The columns provided are: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Since there's no data on conferences in the table, I can't directly verify if they're members of GMC. But maybe I can infer based on other information. The 'joined' column shows when each institution joined something (maybe the conference). For University of Cincinnati, joined is 1991; same for Dayton, DePaul, Marquette. But without knowing what 'joined' refers to, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"Great Midwest Conference\" is a specific conference. I recall that some universities are part of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC), which is associated with Division II sports. Checking quickly, University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton are both in Division I, but maybe they're part of different conferences now.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the current data, the University of Cincinnati is part of the American Athletic Conference (AAC) since 2014, while the University of Dayton is part of the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). So they aren't in the same conference as each other, let alone the GMC. But maybe historically or when they joined something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the table refers to their membership in another group. Let me think: The 'joined' column has years like 1991 for several institutions. Maybe that's when they joined a conference. So if both UC and UD joined the GMC around 1991, then they would be members.\n\nBut wait, I don't know if the table is accurate about their conference memberships because the current info might differ. The problem is that the table doesn't include conference information. So based on the given data, I can't confirm their current or past conference memberships beyond what's inferred from the 'joined' column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Great Midwest Conference\" is a different entity. Let me check: The Great Midwest Conference (GMC) is indeed a Division II conference, but if the institutions in question are in Division I, they wouldn't be part of it. Since both UC and UD are D1, they might not have been part of GMC.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is incorrect or outdated. Let me think again: If the 'joined' column refers to when each institution joined the conference, then if both joined around 1991, that's a clue. But without knowing which conference that is, it's unclear. Maybe they joined the same conference at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Great Midwest Conference is a different entity, and these two institutions are part of it. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but looking back, the claim says \"members of the great midwest conference.\" The table doesn't have any information about conference memberships. So I can't confirm whether they're in that conference based on this data.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that the necessary information (conference membership) isn't present in the table. Therefore, even though both institutions are in Ohio, we can't verify if they belong to the Great Midwest Conference because there's no data on that.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"there be 2 institution locate within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference.\" So regardless of whether they're in the same conference or not, as long as both are in Ohio and members, it's true. But the table doesn't provide conference info.\n\nWait no, the problem is that I need to verify if both institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference based on the data given. Since the table lacks any conference details, I can't confirm or deny it. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table's information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'joined' column refers to when they joined a conference, and since both have the same year (1991), perhaps they joined the same conference that year. So if they joined the GMC in 1991, then they are members.\n\nBut without knowing which conference \"joined\" refers to, it's speculative. So the table doesn't provide enough info to confirm the claim.\n\nWait, but let me check: The Great Midwest Conference (GMC) is a Division II conference that started in 2013. So if these universities were part of it, they'd be DII, which they aren't\u2014they're both D1. Therefore, they can't be part of the GMC as it's a DII conference. So perhaps the claim is false because those two institutions are not members of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nWait, but that's my own knowledge outside the table. The problem says to base everything on the given table. Since the table doesn't mention conferences, I can't use external knowledge. Therefore, based solely on the table, we don't have data about conference memberships.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the claim requires information not provided in the table. Hence, it's not possible to verify if both institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference because there's no data on their conference affiliations.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't provide any information regarding the conferences these institutions belong to. Without this data, we can't confirm whether they're part of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which institutions are part of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). Looking at the table, there's a column called 'joined' with the year they joined. But wait, the claim mentions \"the great midwest conference,\" so I need to confirm if these institutions were indeed part of that conference around 1991.\n\nThe table lists six universities: University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, DePaul University, Marquette University, University of Memphis, and Saint Louis University. Each has a 'joined' year of 1991 except for the University of Dayton which joined in 1993. So out of these six, five have a 'joined' year of 1991.\n\nThe claim states that 5 out of the 6 institutions joined in 1991. From my analysis, exactly five did join in 1991: DePaul (1991), Marquette (1991), University of Cincinnati (1991), Saint Louis (1991), and Memphis (1991). Dayton joined in 1993, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because five out of six listed institutions joined the conference in 1991.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 2 public institution that be member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The table lists several institutions along with their nicknames, locations, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment numbers, and the years they joined and left a conference. The claim is about the number of public institutions in the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nWait, I'm not sure which conference the Great Midwest Conference refers to. Maybe it's a specific college sports conference? But without knowing the exact members, perhaps I need to rely on the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an 'institution' name along with its type (public or private). The claim is about public institutions, so I should focus on those. Let me list out all the public institutions from the table:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati - public\n2. University of Dayton - public? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the type column for Dayton says 'private'. So, correction: University of Dayton is private.\n\nWait, let me go through each row carefully.\n\n- University of Cincinnati: public\n- University of Dayton: private\n- DePaul University: private\n- Marquette University: private\n- University of Memphis: public\n- Saint Louis University: private\n\nSo the public institutions in the table are only two: University of Cincinnati and University of Memphis. \n\nThe claim says there are 2 public institutions that are members of the Great Midwest Conference. So I need to see if both these universities are part of the conference as per the data.\n\nLooking at the 'joined' year column, both are listed as having joined in 1991. However, the table doesn't specify which conference they joined or left from. Without knowing their current conference affiliations, it's impossible to confirm that they are indeed members of the Great Midwest Conference today. The table only shows when they joined and left a conference, but not which one.\n\nWait, but maybe the 'joined' and 'left' columns refer to the Big 12 Conference? Because DePaul, Marquette, Saint Louis, etc., are often associated with other conferences like the Big East or others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is assuming that all these institutions joined the same conference around the same time. But without explicit information about their current memberships, I can't confirm they're part of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nWait, but the task is to check based on the table provided, not external knowledge. So if the claim says there are 2 public institutions in the Great Midwest Conference, and from the table, only two public institutions are listed, regardless of their conference membership, perhaps it's TRUE because they're both public and might be members.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the table shows their past conference memberships, not current. So maybe the claim is about whether they currently are members or have been at some point. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'joined' year is relevant if the Great Midwest Conference started around 1991, and both public universities joined in 1991, so they're part of it.\n\nBut without knowing their left years, it's unclear if they're still part of that conference. The University of Cincinnati left in 1995, same with Dayton, but wait, no\u2014Dayton is private. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: joined 1991, left 1995\n- University of Dayton: joined 1993, left 1995 (but it's private)\n- DePaul: joined 1991, left 1995 (private)\n- Marquette: same as above\n- Memphis: same as above\n- Saint Louis: same.\n\nSo the public ones both left in 1995. But without knowing if they rejoined another conference or are independent now, it's unclear.\n\nBut perhaps the table is indicating that as of when they left, their conference status changed. So maybe by 1995, these universities had left the Great Midwest Conference, so they're no longer members.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify whether they are currently members or have been at some point. It just says \"be member.\" If it's about current membership, then perhaps neither is a member anymore because both left in 1995.\n\nBut if the table is only showing their history, maybe the claim refers to past membership. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Great Midwest Conference is a specific conference that these universities are part of, but again, without knowing, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the 'joined' and 'left' years indicate their participation in a particular conference, which might be the Big 12 or something else. But regardless, from the table, there are only two public institutions listed: Cincinnati and Memphis. So if the claim is about those two being members of the Great Midwest Conference, perhaps it's TRUE because both are public and were part of that conference at some point.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure because I don't know which conference they're referring to. Maybe the table assumes that all institutions joined the same conference when they joined in 1991, so the two public ones did join the conference. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check how many public institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference based on the table.\n\n1. **Public Institutions Identified**: From the table, there are two public institutions:\n   - University of Cincinnati (public)\n   - University of Memphis (public)\n\n2. **Membership Status**: The table shows their 'joined' year as 1991 for both institutions. However, it doesn't specify if they are still members today or which conference they belong to.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since the claim refers to membership in the Great Midwest Conference without specifying current status, and the table only shows historical joining and leaving years, there's insufficient information to confirm current membership. Therefore, based solely on the table data provided, we cannot definitively verify the claim as TRUE or FALSE.\n\nHowever, considering the context that both public institutions joined the conference in 1991 and left in 1995, it implies they were part of the conference at some point, supporting the claim's assertion.\n\n**Final Answer**: TRUE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has several columns: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"student enrol\" which relates to the number of students enrolled. So, my main focus should be on the \"enrollment\" column for both universities mentioned.\n\nI'll locate Saint Louis University in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Saint Louis is one of the institutions listed. Looking at its enrollment figure, it's 13,785 students.\n\nNext, the University of Cincinnati has an enrollment number of 41,357 students.\n\nNow, to check if UC has 27,572 more students than SLU, I need to subtract SLU's enrollment from UC's enrollment. So, 41,357 minus 13,785 equals... let me do that step by step. \n\n41,357 minus 10,000 is 31,357. Then subtract 3,785 more: 31,357 minus 3,785 would be 27,572.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"only 1 institution in the state of ohio be a member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, I should analyze what each part of this claim means and how it relates to the table provided. Let's break down the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions two key points:\n1. Institutions in Ohio.\n2. Membership in the Great Midwest Conference (GMC).\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify which institutions are located in Ohio and then check their membership status in the GMC.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: Located in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n- University of Dayton: Located in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nOther institutions listed are from Chicago, Milwaukee, Memphis, St. Louis, so they're not in Ohio.\n\nNow, I'll look at each relevant row for Ohio institutions to see if they belong to the GMC.\n\nChecking the 'joined' and 'left' columns for these two institutions:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\n- University of Dayton: Joined in 1993, left in 1995.\n\nThe Great Midwest Conference (GMC) is mentioned here. I know that historically, many universities were part of the GMC, but I need to check if they are still members as per the table.\n\nWait, the table shows 'joined' and 'left' years. The University of Cincinnati joined in 1991 and left in 1995. Similarly, Dayton joined in 1993 and also left in 1995. So both were members for some time but left by 1995.\n\nI recall that after 1997, the GMC was renamed to something else, perhaps the Midwestern Conference or another name, but I'm not entirely sure. However, based on the table's data, both institutions did join and leave the GMC. \n\nThe claim says \"only 1 institution in the state of ohio be a member.\" But according to the table, as of the 'joined' year (1991-1993), both were members. So that would mean there are two Ohio institutions in the GMC, which contradicts the claim.\n\nWait, but I should check if they're currently members now. The table shows their 'left' year as 1995. If the Great Midwest Conference exists today under a different name, like Midwestern Conference or something else, perhaps these universities have rejoined. But according to the information given in the table, both left by 1995 and didn't rejoin based on the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to only one being a member currently. However, since the table doesn't provide information beyond 1995, I can only go by what's shown. If the GMC still exists today and these institutions are part of it now, then both would be members again, making two in Ohio, which contradicts the claim.\n\nWait, but the table might not reflect current status. It could show historical data. So if both left in 1995, they might have rejoined later. I'm not sure without additional information, but based on the table alone, as of their last 'left' year (1995), both were members of the GMC.\n\nSo, according to the table's data, there are two Ohio institutions (University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton) that were part of the Great Midwest Conference. Therefore, the claim stating only one is incorrect based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that only one institution in Ohio is a member of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). However, both the University of Cincinnati and the University of Dayton are listed as members of the GMC before 1995. This means there were two institutions from Ohio in the conference, contradicting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"only private institution be member of the great midwest conference.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the Great Midwest Conference (GMC) includes. From the table, I can see that each institution has a type: public or private. The claim is asserting that only private institutions are members of GMC. So I need to check which institutions in the table are part of GMC and whether they're all private.\n\nLooking at the 'joined' column, it seems like all these universities joined in 1991 except for University of Cincinnati which joined in 1991 as well. Wait, no, looking again: University of Cincinnati's 'joined' is 1991? Let me check the table again. Yes, university of cincinnati has joined in 1991.\n\nWait, but I think the Great Midwest Conference might include both public and private universities. For example, I recall that some public universities are part of it. So if the claim says only private institutions are members, that would be false because there are likely public members too.\n\nBut let me look at the data provided. The table includes several universities: University of Cincinnati is public, and others like DePaul, Marquette, etc., are private. If the claim is saying that all GMC members are private, but in reality, if the conference has public institutions as well, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but from the data given, it's not clear which conference these institutions belong to. The table just lists their details. So perhaps I need to focus on whether all the institutions listed in the table that joined around 1991 are private. But without knowing the exact membership of GMC, maybe the key is to look at the type column.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the point is that the claim says \"only private institution be member of the great midwest conference.\" So I need to check if all institutions in the table that are part of GMC are private. But since I don't have information on which specific conferences they belong to, maybe the assumption is that the relevant columns are 'type' and 'joined'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the table, some institutions joined the GMC and their type is private. So if all those who joined are private, then the claim might hold. But looking at the data:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: public, joined 1991\n- Dayton: private, 1993\n- DePaul: private, 1991\n- Marquette: private, 1991\n- Memphis: public, 1991\n- St. Louis: private, 1991\n\nSo the ones who joined in 1991 are Cincinnati (public), DePaul (private), Marquette (private), and Memphis (public). So there are both public and private members among those who joined in 1991.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says only private institutions are members of GMC, that's false because some public institutions are also part of it. So the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to find all cells that relate to verifying this claim. The columns involved would be 'type' (to check if they're private) and 'joined' (to see when they joined). So for each institution that is a member of GMC, we look at their type and join year.\n\nSo the relevant rows are those where 'joined' is 1991 because that's when the others might have joined. Let me check which ones joined in 1991:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: public\n- DePaul: private\n- Marquette: private\n- Memphis: public\n- St Louis: private\n\nSo these five institutions are relevant because they joined around 1991, and their types are public or private. Thus, the 'type' column is important here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"only private institution be member of the great midwest conference\" is false because both public and private institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the university of cincinnati have the same number of student enrol as saint louis university.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate both universities in the table. Let me scan through each row.\n\nThe University of Cincinnati is first. Its nickname is bearcats, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1819, public type, and enrollment is 41,357 students. Saint Louis University is another row; its nickname is billikens, located in St. Louis, Missouri, private type, and the enrollment is 13,785.\n\nNow, I need to compare their enrollments. The claim says they have the same number of student enrol. So, let's see: 41,357 vs. 13,785. Those numbers are quite different. Cincinnati has over three times as many students as Saint Louis.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something? Let me double-check. University of Cincinnati's enrollment is indeed 41,357. Saint Louis is listed at 13,785. Yes, that's a significant difference, not the same number at all.\n\nSo, based on this comparison, the claim is false because their enrollments differ.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the University of Cincinnati and Saint Louis University have the same number of student enrollments. However, upon reviewing the table, the enrollment figures are 41,357 for Cincinnati and 13,785 for Saint Louis, which are not equal.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Locate both universities in the table.\n   - University of Cincinnati is at row index 0.\n   - Saint Louis University is at row index 6.\n2. **Extract Enrollment Data:**\n   - For Cincinnati, enrollment is 41,357.\n   - For Saint Louis, enrollment is 13,785.\n3. **Compare Numbers:** 41,357 \u2260 13,785.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because their enrollments differ significantly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"more than half of the members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860.\"\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the Great Midwest Conference includes. Looking at the table, I see several universities listed, but none with \"Great Midwest Conference\" as their nickname or any related info. Wait, perhaps the table is about a conference and each row is a member? Or maybe each row represents something else.\n\nWait, the table headers are institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left. So each row is an institution. The claim is about a conference, so I need to figure out which institutions belong to the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nBut the problem is that in the given table, the nicknames don't mention anything about the Great Midwest Conference. For example, University of Cincinnati's nickname is Bearcats, Depaul's is Blue Demons, etc. So perhaps the table isn't directly related to the conference itself but lists universities, and I need to see if more than half of a specific conference's members were founded before 1860.\n\nWait, maybe the Great Midwest Conference is another name for something else? Or perhaps it's a hypothetical conference where I have to look at the founding dates. But since the table doesn't mention the conference, I might be missing information. Alternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a specific group of universities that are part of this conference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Great Midwest Conference is a historical reference or another name for something else. Without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe I should assume that the table includes all members of the Great Midwest Conference and proceed from there.\n\nLooking at the claim again: \"more than half of the members... were founded before 1860.\" So, if I can count how many universities in the conference were founded before 1860, it needs to be more than half.\n\nSo first, I need to identify all the universities that are part of the Great Midwest Conference. But since the table doesn't specify that, maybe I have to infer or perhaps the table is incomplete. Alternatively, maybe the claim refers to a different group.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, it's possible that the Great Midwest Conference includes the listed universities. But without knowing that for sure, I can't proceed accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the Great Midwest Conference is a fictional one for the sake of this exercise.\n\nAssuming that the table includes all members of the Great Midwest Conference, I need to check their founding dates.\n\nSo let's look at the \"founded\" column:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819\n- University of Dayton: 1850\n- Depaul University: 1898\n- Marquette University: 1881\n- University of Memphis: 1912\n- Saint Louis University: 1818\n\nWait, but wait. The table shows six universities. If the Great Midwest Conference includes all six, then more than half would mean at least four.\n\nNow, let's see how many were founded before 1860:\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati: 1819 \u2013 yes\nUniversity of Dayton: 1850 \u2013 yes (since 1850 is less than 1860)\nSaint Louis University: 1818 \u2013 yes\n\nSo that's three universities.\n\nDepaul was founded in 1898, which is after 1860.\nMarquette in 1881, also after.\nMemphis in 1912, after.\n\nSo out of six, three were before 1860. Three is exactly half, not more than half.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"more than half\" would be false because it's exactly half, not more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: 1819 \u2013 yes\n2. University of Dayton: 1850 \u2013 yes (before 1860)\n3. Saint Louis University: 1818 \u2013 yes\nThat's three. So three out of six.\n\nSo more than half would require at least four, which isn't the case here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that more than half of the members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860. By analyzing the table, we find that exactly three universities (University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, and Saint Louis University) were established before 1860. Since three out of six is not more than half, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
