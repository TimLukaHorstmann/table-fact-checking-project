    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"none of the latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It looks like it's a list of submissions from Latvia for some ceremony, probably related to film awards. The columns are: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nThe claim is stating that none of these Latvian submissions were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. So I need to check each submission's result to see if any have been nominated for that category.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. 1992 (65th) - film \"the child of man\" with director J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds. Result is \"not nominated.\"\n2. 2008 (81st) - film \"defenders of riga\" directed by Aigars Grauba. Result: not nominated.\n3. 2010 (83rd) - film \"hong kong confidential\" by M\u0101ris Martinsons. Not nominated.\n4. 2012 (85th) - \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" by Yevgeni Pashkevich. Again, not nominated.\n5. 2013 (86th) - \"mother , i love you\" directed by J\u0101nis Nords. Result is listed as \"tbd,\" which I think stands for \"to be determined.\" But since it's not explicitly stated as \"nominated\" or \"not nominated,\" maybe that's something to consider.\n\nWait, the claim says \"none of the latvian submission be nominated,\" so even if one was nominated, the claim would be FALSE. So I need to check each row to see if any have been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nIn the table provided, all results are either \"not nominated\" or \"tbd.\" The 2013 entry's result is \"tbd,\" which might mean it's still under consideration but hasn't been decided yet. However, without a nomination, I don't think that's considered as being nominated.\n\nWait, but in the table, the \"result\" column doesn't specify the category. So maybe all these are submissions for Best Foreign Language Film? Or is each submission for different categories?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the film titles: they might not necessarily be the same as the official submissions for that specific award. For example, the original titles in Latvian could have been submitted under other names. So perhaps I'm missing context.\n\nBut according to the table, none of these films were nominated. All results are \"not nominated\" except for 2013, which is \"tbd.\" If \"tbd\" means not yet decided but not necessarily a nomination, then still, no film was actually nominated.\n\nTherefore, none of the Latvian submissions have been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, so the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to check each cell relevant to verify. So I need to look at all rows where the film might have been in competition for that category. The columns are: year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, result.\n\nSo, for each row, the \"result\" is either not nominated or tbd. Since none of them say \"nominated,\" then yes, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE, we need to check all relevant cells in the table. The claim states that none of the Latvian submissions were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. By examining each row's result column, we see that no film was named \"nominated.\" \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim: \"2 of the 5 films be directed by j\u0101nis nords.\" So, the claim is stating that out of the five films listed in the table, two were directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. The rows correspond to different years when the films were nominated for something, likely the Academy Awards based on the context.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one to see if any of them are directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\n1. **1992 (65th)**: The director is listed as J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds. This doesn't match J\u0101nis Nords.\n2. **2008 (81st)**: Directed by Aigars Grauba. Not the same as J\u0101nis Nords.\n3. **2010 (83rd)**: Directed by M\u0101ris Martinsons. Doesn't match.\n4. **2012 (85th)**: Directed by Yevgeni Pashkevich. Also not a match.\n5. **2013 (86th)**: Here, the director is J\u0101nis Nords. This is one.\n\nSo far, only one film in 2013 was directed by J\u0101nis Nords. The claim says two of them, so I need to check if there's another.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed something? Let me double-check each row:\n\n- 1992: J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds\n- 2008: Aigars Grauba\n- 2010: M\u0101ris Martinsons\n- 2012: Yevgeni Pashkevich\n- 2013: J\u0101nis Nords\n\nNo, only one film directed by J\u0101nis Nords. Therefore, the claim that two films are directed by him is false.\n\nWait a minute\u2014did I misread any of the director names? Let me check each row carefully:\n\n- **1992**: J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds\n- **2008**: Aigars Grauba\n- **2010**: M\u0101ris Martinsons\n- **2012**: Yevgeni Pashkevich\n- **2013**: J\u0101nis Nords\n\nYes, only the last one matches. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the table has more rows beyond the five shown? The instruction says \"5 films,\" so I think it's only these five. Therefore, only one film directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim states two films, but in reality, there's only one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because only one of the five films listed was directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"mother , i love you and gulf stream under the iceberg be submitted 1 year after the other.\" So, it's saying that two films were submitted a year apart.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are several rows, each representing a different ceremony year. The columns include year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nI need to find which of these films are involved in the claim. From the table:\n\n- For 2013 (86th), the film is \"mother , i love you\" with the original title \"mammu , es tevi m\u012blu\", directed by J\u0101nis Nords, and the result is TBD.\n- For 2012 (85th), the film is \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" with the original title \"golfa straume zem ledus kalna,\" directed by Yevgeni Pashkevich, and the result is not nominated.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says both films were submitted 1 year apart. So I need to check if these two films are consecutive in their submission years.\n\nLooking at their ceremony years:\n- \"mother , i love you\" was submitted in 2013.\n- \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" was submitted in 2012.\n\nThat means they're actually a year apart, but since 2012 is before 2013, it's only one year difference. But wait, if submission happens around the same time each year, then 2012 and 2013 are consecutive years, so one year apart. So yes, they were submitted 1 year after each other.\n\nBut wait, in the table, \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" is from 2012, and \"mother , i love you\" is from 2013. So 2012 to 2013 is indeed a 1-year difference. Therefore, the claim seems correct based on their submission years.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any other film mentioned in the claim that might not align. The claim mentions two films: \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" Both are present in the table, so that part checks out.\n\nAlso, looking at their results, both are marked as \"not nominated.\" But the claim doesn't specify whether they were nominated or not; it's just about the submission timing. So that's okay.\n\nSo putting this together, the claim is true because both films were submitted 1 year apart.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two films, \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg,\" were submitted one year apart. Checking the table:\n\n- \"mother , i love you\" was submitted in 2013 (86th ceremony).\n- \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" was submitted in 2012 (85th ceremony).\n\nSince 2013 is exactly one year after 2012, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2013, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2012, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break down what the claim says: \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The term \"defender of riga\" likely corresponds to one of the columns in the table. Looking at the table, I see that there's a column named \"film title used in nomination.\" Let me check if \"defender of riga\" is listed here.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- 1992: \"the child of man\"\n- 2008: \"defenders of riga\"\n- 2010: \"hong kong confidential\"\n- 2012: \"gulf stream under the iceberg\"\n- 2013: \"mother , i love you\"\n\nYes, in the 2008 row, the film title is \"defenders of riga.\" So that's the relevant cell for the claim.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"previous submission.\" I need to find when this film was submitted before. Looking at the table, each entry has a \"year (ceremony)\" column. For 2008, the previous ceremony would be the one before that, which is 1997 (but not listed here). However, in the table provided, the most recent submission before 2008 is likely earlier entries.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The table starts with 1992 and goes up to 2013. So \"defenders of riga\" was submitted in 2008. To find when it was submitted previously, I need to check if there's an earlier submission by the same film title under a different director or original title.\n\nLooking at other years:\n- In 1992: \"the child of man,\" which is different from \"defenders of riga.\"\n- 2008: submitted as \"defenders of riga\" by Aigars Grauba.\n- Are there any earlier entries for \"defenders of riga\"? No, the table only shows it once in 2008.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about being submitted more than a decade after the previous submission. So if \"defenders of riga\" was submitted in 2008, when was it last submitted before that?\n\nLooking at the table again, there's no earlier entry for \"defenders of riga.\" So maybe the previous submission refers to another film? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the same film being submitted more than a decade after its initial submission. Since \"defenders of riga\" was submitted in 2008 and there's no earlier entry, it hasn't been submitted before. Therefore, the statement might be incorrect.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"be submit more than a decade after the previous submission.\" If the film wasn't previously submitted (as per the table), then this is false because there was no prior submission to wait ten years from. So the claim would be false.\n\nBut I need to check if any other cells are relevant. The claim talks about \"defender of riga,\" so that's one cell. Also, maybe the director or original title could be related if the same film was submitted again under a different director, but in this case, it's only listed once with Aigars Grauba.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index 1 (2008) for \"film title used in nomination\" as \"defenders of riga.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table here with some information about films and their submissions for the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film. The claim is: \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to check each part of the claim against the table. Let's look at the claim word by word. It mentions \"5 Latvian films,\" so that refers to five movies from Latvia submitted in a particular year. The claim also says \"in 21 year.\" Wait, \"21 year\" isn't a specific number\u2014maybe it's a typo? Maybe they meant 2010s or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could it be referring to the year being 2021? Or is it just a mistake in the claim? Hmm.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"year (ceremony),\" which I think corresponds to the Academy Awards ceremony year. The columns are: film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. So the relevant columns for the claim would be the ones that relate directly\u2014probably \"film title used in nomination\" since it's about what was submitted, and maybe \"year (ceremony)\" to check which films were nominated each year.\n\nThe claim is talking about five Latvian films being submitted in a specific year. Wait, let me see how many films are actually from Latvia in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1992: The film is \"the child of man,\" original title \"cilv\u0113ka b\u0113rns,\" directed by J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds. So that's one.\n- 2008: \"defenders of riga\" (original \"r\u012bgas sargi\") by Aigars Grauba\u2014second.\n- 2010: \"hong kong confidential\" (original \"amaya\") by Mariis Martinsons\u2014third.\n- 2012: \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" (original \"golfa straume zem ledus kalna\") by Yevgeni Pashkevich\u2014fourth.\n- 2013: \"mother , i love you\" (original \"mammu , es tevi m\u012blu\") by J\u0101nis Nords\u2014fifth.\n\nSo there are five films listed from Latvia. Now, the claim says \"in 21 year be submit.\" Wait, 21 year doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a typo for 2010s? Or perhaps they meant 2021? Let me check the years in the table. The earliest is 1992, then 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013. So there are films submitted every few years but not annually.\n\nWait, the claim says \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit.\" Maybe it's trying to say that in the 2021 ceremony (assuming 21 as shorthand), five Latvian films were submitted. But looking at the table, the latest submission is from 2013. The most recent one I can see is 2013. There are no films from years beyond 2013 in this table.\n\nSo if we consider the claim to be referring to 2021, that would mean there should have been five submissions in 2021. But in reality, the latest data here ends in 2013. Without additional information about later years, I can't confirm if five films were submitted in 2021.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't go up to 2021. So even if the claim is talking about a specific year after 2013, like 2020 or 2021, we don't have data on whether five films were submitted then. The claim might be incorrect because, based on the provided data, only five films from Latvia have been submitted up to 2013.\n\nAlternatively, if \"21 year\" is a typo for another number, like 2010s (which would be years 2010-2019), but in the table, we only see submissions through 2013. So even within that, there are only five films as per the data provided.\n\nBut the main issue is whether five Latvian films were submitted in a specific year. The table shows five films submitted from Latvia over several years (1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013). If the claim is about a particular year like 2021, we can't confirm it based on this data because there are no submissions listed after 2013.\n\nSo, considering all this, the claim's statement that \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit\" isn't fully supported by the table. The relevant cells would be the ones containing the five films from Latvia, which are rows 0 to 4, but since the claim refers to a specific year (probably 2021), and we don't have data beyond 2013, it's not accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five Latvian films were submitted in the year 21 for consideration of the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film. Upon reviewing the table, five films from Latvia are indeed listed: \"the child of man,\" \"defenders of riga,\" \"hong kong confidential,\" \"gulf stream under the iceberg,\" and \"mother , i love you.\" These submissions span multiple years (1992 to 2013). However, the claim specifically refers to a single year, likely \"2021,\" which is not covered in the provided data. Since the table does not include any films submitted after 2013, there's no evidence to support the claim for 2021. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"mother , i love you and defender of riga be submitted 1 year after the other.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two films: \"mother , i love you\" and \"defender of riga.\" I need to check their entries in the table. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For \"mother , i love you,\" it's listed under the 2013 (86th) ceremony. The film title used in nomination is \"mother , i love you,\" and the original title is \"mammu , es tevi m\u012blu.\" The director is J\u0101nis Nords, and the result is \"tbd\" which I think means \"to be decided\" or not yet determined.\n\n- For \"defender of riga,\" it's in the 2008 (81st) ceremony. The film title used in nomination is \"defenders of riga,\" but wait, that doesn't match exactly with the claim. The original title is \"r\u012bgas sargi,\" and the director is Aigars Grauba.\n\nWait, the claim says both films were submitted one year after each other. So, let's check their submission years.\n\n\"mother , i love you\" was submitted in 2013 (86th ceremony), which I assume is 2013 because the 86th annual ceremony would be around that time.\n\n\"defender of riga\" was submitted in 2008 (81st), so that's two years before \"mother , i love you.\" So, they are not one year apart. In fact, they're three years apart. That doesn't fit the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the table again. The 2013 film is submitted in 2013 (86th), and the 2008 film was submitted in 2008 (81st). So the difference is 5 years (from 2008 to 2013). That's not one year apart.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that both films were submitted in the same year? No, because they are different entries with a few years between them.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes films can be submitted multiple times. For example, \"defender of riga\" might have been resubmitted later. But looking at the table, each film submission seems to be a single event unless otherwise indicated. There's no indication here that either film was resubmitted more than once in the years listed.\n\nAlso, the claim says they were submitted one year after the other. So if \"defender of riga\" was submitted in 2008 and \"mother , i love you\" in 2013, that's a three-year gap. Not one year apart.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the row indices. Let me check:\n\n- The 2013 entry is row index 4 (since it's the fifth row, starting from 0).\n- The 2008 entry is row index 1.\n\nSo, the years are 2008 and 2013, which is five years apart, not one year. So the claim that they were submitted one year after each other is false.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mother , i love you\" and \"defender of riga\" were submitted one year after each other. Checking the table:\n\n- \"mother , i love you\" was submitted in 2013 (86th ceremony).\n- \"defender of riga\" was submitted in 2008 (81st ceremony), which is five years earlier, not one year.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the films were not submitted one year apart but several years apart. \n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade before the next submission.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row in the table to see if there's any relevant information that supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **1992 (65th)**: Film title used in nomination is \"the child of man\", original title \"cilv\u0113ka b\u0113rns\", director J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds, result not nominated.\n- **2008 (81st)**: Film title is \"defenders of riga\", original title \"r\u012bgas sargi\", director Aigars Grauba, result not nominated.\n- **2010 (83rd)**: Film title used is \"hong kong confidential\", original title \"amaya\", director M\u0101ris Martinsons, not nominated.\n- **2012 (85th)**: Film title is \"gulf stream under the iceberg\", original title \"golfa straume zem ledus kalna\", director Yevgeni Pashkevich, not nominated.\n- **2013 (86th)**: Film title used in nomination is \"mother , i love you\", original title \"mammu , es tevi m\u012blu\", director J\u0101nis Nords, result TBD.\n\nThe claim mentions \"defenders of riga.\" So I'm looking for that specific film title in the table. From the data, it's only present in the 2008 (81st) row. The claim is about \"being submitted more than a decade before the next submission.\"\n\nI need to check if there are subsequent submissions after 2008 where \"defenders of riga\" was again submitted. Let me look at the years provided:\n\n- 1992\n- 2008\n- 2010\n- 2012\n- 2013\n\nThe next submission after 2008 would be 2010, then 2012, then 2013.\n\nNow, I need to see if \"defenders of riga\" was submitted again in any of these subsequent years. From the table, there's no other entry for that film title. It was only submitted in 2008 and nowhere else. So it wasn't submitted again in 2010, 2012, or 2013.\n\nWait, but the claim is about being submitted more than a decade before the next submission. Let me check the difference between 2008 and the next submission after that. The next submissions are 2010 (2 years later), then 2012 (4 years later from 2010), then 2013 (1 year after 2012). None of these gaps are over a decade.\n\nSo, looking at each row:\n\n- **Row for 2008**: Film title is \"defenders of riga\". This is the only submission in the table. There's no next submission for this film title after 2008 in the provided data.\n  \nTherefore, there is no evidence that \"defenders of riga\" was submitted more than a decade before its next submission because it doesn't appear again in the table.\n\nSo the claim is false because the film wasn't submitted again in any subsequent years provided. The relevant cell is where the film title is mentioned in 2008.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the data provided, as \"defenders of riga\" was only submitted once in 2008 and didn't appear again in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" Hmm, that seems a bit unclear at first glance. Let me parse it.\n\nI think it's saying that there are 5 Latvian films submitted in the 11th year for consideration of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because the table shows years like 1992 (65th), 2008 (81st), etc. So maybe I misread it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's saying that 5 Latvian films were submitted in a particular year (maybe the 11th ceremony or the 11th year?) and each of those films was considered for the Oscar. But looking at the table, each row represents a specific ceremony or year. So I need to check if there are five films from Latvia submitted in a certain year, specifically 2013 as per one of the rows.\n\nWait, the claim might be more accurately stating that \"5 Latvian films were submitted for consideration in 11 years.\" Or maybe it's about five films being submitted in the 11th ceremony. Let me look at the table again.\n\nThe table has rows with year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. The years go from 1992 to 2013. Each row shows one film submission. So in total, there are five films listed, each submitted in different years.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit.\" That wording is a bit off. Maybe it's about five films being submitted over 11 years? Or maybe it's that in the 11th year, five films were submitted?\n\nLooking back at the table, each row represents one film submission. So there are five films listed, each from different years: 1992 (65th), 2008 (81st), 2010 (83rd), 2012 (85th), and 2013 (86th). The claim says \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit,\" which might mean that five films were submitted in the 11th ceremony, but that doesn't align with the table because each submission is a separate year.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is stating that there are five films from Latvia submitted in a particular year, maybe the 11th or 11 years. But looking at the table, each film corresponds to one ceremony. So if the claim says \"in 11 year,\" perhaps it's referring to the 11th ceremony (year), but the table shows that only four films are there from after 1992: 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013. Wait, no, each row is a separate submission.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse the claim correctly. Let me try again. The claim says \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" So it's saying that five films from Latvia were submitted in the 11th year (maybe the 11th ceremony) for consideration of the Oscar.\n\nLooking at the table, each row is a separate submission. The years listed are 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. So there are five films total, each submitted in different years. The claim seems to suggest that all five were submitted in the same year (the 11th), which isn't true because they're spread across multiple years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is stating that there have been five submissions from Latvia in the past 11 years, but looking at the table, the latest submission is 2013. So from 1992 to 2013 is more than 11 years (1992 to 2013 is 21 years). Therefore, five films were submitted over those 21 years, not just 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim might be saying that in the 11th year (maybe 2003?), five films from Latvia were submitted for the Oscar. But looking at the table, the first submission is in 1992, and then others are spread out. So if we look for a specific year, say, the 11th ceremony (assuming that's 1943), but there's no film from Latvia submitted then.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about five films being submitted in 2011 (the 11th year since 2000?), but the table doesn't show any submission in 2011. The latest is 2013.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the claim is incorrect because the table shows only five films from Latvia submitted over several years, not all in one particular year (like the 11th). So if the claim says that in a specific year, like the 11th, five films were submitted, that's false because each row represents a separate submission.\n\nWait, no. Each row is a separate ceremony, so each film is from a different year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that all five films were submitted in the same year (the 11th), which isn't true. They were submitted in different years.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is saying that over 11 years, five films were submitted, that would be true because from 1992 to 2013, there are more than 11 years, and indeed five films were submitted. But the wording of the claim isn't clear on that.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each film is a single submission. So the total number of submissions from Latvia is five, spread over multiple years. Therefore, the claim might be misleading if it suggests that all five were submitted in one year or in 11 years. Alternatively, if the claim is stating that five films were submitted up to the 11th ceremony, which would be around 2003, but looking at the table, the first submission was in 1992, so by 2003 (the 11th ceremony), only the 1992 film would have been submitted.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe claim is: \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" So perhaps it's saying that five films from Latvia were submitted in a specific 11th year (like the 11th Academy Awards ceremony, which was in 1948). But looking at the table, there are no submissions from Latvia before 1992. So if the claim is about the 11th ceremony (1948), then definitely it's false because the first submission from Latvia was much later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"11 year\" refers to the 11th year after some event, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is misworded and means that five films were submitted in any of 11 years, which would be true because the table shows five films over multiple years, including more than 10 years.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in 11 year,\" which probably refers to a single specific year. Since none of the submissions are from 1948 (the 11th), that part is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue and the claim actually means that five films have been submitted over 11 years. But even so, looking at the table, only five films have been submitted from Latvia across several years, not necessarily in any specific 11-year period.\n\nI think the key point is that the claim says \"in 11 year,\" implying a single year where all five were submitted, which isn't true because each submission is from a different year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"5 Latvian films in the 11th year were submitted for the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film\" is false.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:** The claim suggests that five Latvian films were all submitted in a specific 11th year, likely referring to the 11th Academy Awards ceremony held in 1948. However, historical data indicates no submissions from Latvia before 1992.\n\n2. **Analyzing Submissions Over Time:** From the provided data (films submitted between 1992 and 2013), there are indeed five films from Latvia submitted over multiple years, not all within a single year like the 11th ceremony.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since each film is submitted in a different year, it's incorrect to claim that all five were submitted in the same 11th year. Therefore, the statement is false.",
