    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It compares two song points: \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and \"croire\". The claim states that \"vivo...\" has higher points than \"croire\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different song with various attributes like language, artist, etc., but the key columns here are \"song\" and \"points\".\n\nSo I need to locate the rows where the song is \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and where the song is \"croire\". Then compare their points.\n\nStarting with \"vivo (ti scrivo)\". Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 18: The song is \"vivo (ti scrivo)\". Its points are 52.\n  \nNext, finding \"croire\":\n\n- I go through each row. It seems \"croire\" isn't listed as a song title in this table. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the 'song' column:\n\nRow 17: Song is \"croire\". Points for that are 90.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\". So if I found both, then compare.\n\nSo vivo has 52 points, and croire has 90. Therefore, 52 < 90. The claim is saying vivo > croire, which is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the table.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 18: Song is \"vivo (ti scrivo)\", points 52.\n\nRow 17: Song is \"croire\", points 90.\n\nYes, so vivo has lower points than croire. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns are 'song' and 'points'.\n\nFor \"vivo (ti scrivo)\", it's in row 18, column 'song'. So that's one cell.\n\nWait, actually, each song has a row with multiple columns. But for the claim, we're comparing two songs: their names and points.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For \"vivo (ti scrivo)\": row 18, column 'points' which is 52.\n  \n- For \"croire\": row 17, column 'points' which is 90.\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row has several columns. The 'song' column is one of them, and 'points' is another.\n\nSo I think I should include both the 'song' cell and the 'points' cell for each relevant song.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row 18, column 'song' (vivo)\n2. Row 18, column 'points' (52)\n3. Row 17, column 'song' (croire)\n4. Row 17, column 'points' (90)\n\nWait, but in the initial example, they included row index and column name. So for each song, I need to get their points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the 'song' and 'points' columns where relevant.\n\nSo:\n\n- vivo is in row 18: so row_index=18, column_name='song'\n\n- croire is in row 17: row_index=17, column_name='song'\n\nAlso, for each of these, their points are in their respective rows under the 'points' column. So to compare, I need both the song names and their points.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor vivo (ti scrivo):\n- row_index 18, column 'song'\n- row_index 18, column 'points'\n\nFor croire:\n- row_index 17, column 'song'\n- row_index 17, column 'points'\n\nBut wait, is \"croire\" even present? Let me confirm. Yes, in the table, it's listed as row 17: \"croire\". So yes.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those four: two for vivo and two for croire.\n\nWait, but in the example given, they had two cells: two columns from different rows. So perhaps I should include all four.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about the points of two songs, so to verify it, we need both their 'points' values and confirm that one is higher than the other. Therefore, the relevant cells are the 'points' columns for both songs and their respective row indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the 'points' column needs to be checked because the song names are in the 'song' column. But I think the instruction says to include the row index and column name for each relevant cell.\n\nSo to verify the claim, we need:\n\n- The points of vivo (ti scrivo): row 18, column 'points'\n\n- The points of croire: row 17, column 'points'\n\nBecause without knowing their points, you can't compare them.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps also including their song names as they are part of the claim. So:\n\n- vivo's row: row 18, 'song' and 'points'\n\n- croire's row: row 17, 'song' and 'points'\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be four in total.\n\nBut let me see how the example was structured. In their example, they had two entries, each from different rows but same column (Revenue and Employees). So perhaps for our case, we need to include both points columns for the two songs.\n\nSo that's:\n\n1. Row 18, 'points' (vivo)\n\n2. Row 17, 'points' (croire)\n\nBut wait, also their song names are relevant because the claim is about those specific songs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's enough to have their points and the fact that they're in the table.\n\nBut according to the instructions: \"You are tasked with identifying which cells contain information necessary to evaluate the statement.\"\n\nSo for evaluating whether vivo has higher points than croire, we need:\n\n- The value of vivo's points (cell row 18, column 'points')\n\n- The value of croire's points (cell row 17, column 'points')\n\nTherefore, these two cells are essential.\n\nThus, in the answer, I should list both: their respective row indices and columns.\n\nSo the final relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row 18, column 'points'\n\n2. Row 17, column 'points'\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has a higher point value than \"croire\". To evaluate this, we compare their points:\n\n- **vivo (ti scrivo)**: Found in row 18, column 'points', with a value of 52.\n- **croire**: Found in row 17, column 'points', with a value of 90.\n\nSince 52 is less than 90, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n1. Row 18, column 'points'\n2. Row 17, column 'points'",
