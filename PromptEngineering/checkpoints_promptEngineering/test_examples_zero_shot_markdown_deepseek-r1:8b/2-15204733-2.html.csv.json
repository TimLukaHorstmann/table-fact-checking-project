    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the album les mot , remixed by laurent boutonnat , have \u00e0 version of album version.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to be saying that there's an album called \"les mots\" (which I assume is \"Les Mots\") that was remixed by Laurent Boutonnat and has a version titled \"album version.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if such an entry exists. The table lists various versions of songs or albums, along with details like length, album name, remixers, etc.\n\nI'll start by looking for the album name \"les mots.\" Scanning through each row's 'album' column:\n\n- Row 0: cendres de lune\n- Row 1: -\n- Row 2: -\n- Row 3: les clips , music videos i\n- Row 4: -\n- Row 5: -\n- Row 6: les clips , music videos i\n- Row 7: cendres de lune\n- Row 8: en concert\n- Row 9: dance remixes\n- Row 10: live \u00e0 bercy\n- Row 11: mylenium tour\n- Row 12: les mots\n- Row 13: remixes\n- Row 14: n degree5 on tour\n\nSo, row 12 has \"les mots\" as the album name. Now, let's check what version it corresponds to. The 'version' column for row 12 is \"album version.\" That matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to verify if it was remixed by Laurent Boutonnat. Looking at the 'remixed by' column for row 12: it says \"laurent boutonnat,\" which matches the claim's mention of being remixed by him.\n\nPutting this together, yes, there is an album version of \"les mots\" by Laurent Boutonnat as per the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"version\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"in 1986, the instrumental version of le clip, music video i be 3:31.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check against the table. Let's see:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim specifies 1986.\n2. **Song or Version**: It mentions \"instrumental version\" and refers to \"le clip, music videos i.\"\n3. **Duration**: It states the duration is 3:31.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for entries from 1986 where these elements match. \n\nStarting with the year, I'll focus on rows where the 'year' column is 1986. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: album version of \"cendres de lune\" by laurent boutonnat.\n- Row 1: single version, no album or song specified.\n- Row 2: long version, same as above.\n- Row 3: instrumental version, mentions \"les clips , music videos i.\"\n- Row 4: remix version.\n- Row 5: new remix by thierry rogen.\n- Row 6: soundtrack from the video, same song reference as row 3.\n- Row 7: remix special club, album version of \"cendres de lune.\"\n- Row 8: live version recorded in 1989, so not 1986.\n- Rows 9 onwards are for later years.\n\nNow, focusing on rows 3 and 6 which mention \"les clips , music videos i.\" \n\nRow 3 (index 3) has the instrumental version with a duration of 3:31. So this seems to match all parts of the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other 1986 rows might be relevant, but none else reference \"le clip, music video i\" and an instrumental version specifically. \n\nSo, yes, row 3 in the table has the instrumental version of \"les clips , music videos i\" with a duration of 3:31 from 1986.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"instrumental\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"laurent boutonnat remixed \u00e0 long version and \u00e0 remix version in 1986.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see all the entries related to Laurent Boutonnat and the years around 1986.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows are:\n\n1. album version\n2. single version\n3. long version\n4. instrumental\n5. remix\n6. new remix\n7. soundtrack from the video\n8. remix special club\n9. live version (recorded in 1989)\n10. carnal sins remix\n11. live version (recorded in 1996)\n12. live version (recorded in 2000)\n13. album version\n14. y - front remix\n15. live version (recorded in 2009)\n\nNow, I need to find the ones where Laurent Boutonnat is involved and the year is 1986.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 3: long version, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat, year 1986.\n- Row 5: remix, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat, year 1986.\n\nSo, there are two remixes by Laurent Boutonnat in 1986: one for the long version and another for the remix. That directly supports the claim that he remixed both versions in 1986.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are rows 3 and 5.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms that Laurent Boutonnat remixed both the long version and the remix in 1986.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the carnal sin remix by laurent boutonnat be more than 7:00\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"carnal sin remix.\" Looking at the table, I need to find any row that has \"carnal sins remix\" as the name. Scanning through the rows, I see a few options:\n\n1. The first one is \"carnal sins remix\" in row 9 with a length of 7:00 and remixed by laurent boutonnat.\n2. There's also a \"live version (recorded in 1989)\" which is longer but not the carnal sin remix.\n\nSo, the relevant row here is row 9 with column name \"carnal sins remix.\" The length listed there is exactly 7:00. The claim says it's \"more than 7:00,\" so I need to compare that.\n\nWait, the length is exactly 7:00, not more than that. So, does being equal count as more than? No, because more than implies longer than. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate here.\n\nNow, checking other relevant cells. The \"remixed by\" column for row 9 says laurent boutonnat, which matches part of the claim. But since the length doesn't exceed 7:00, that's where the discrepancy is.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is false because the remix in question is exactly 7:00, not more than that.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"carnal sin remix\" by laurent boutonnat exceeds 7:00. From the table, the remix's length is precisely 7:00, so it doesn't surpass that duration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"carnal sins remix\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the instrumental version in 1986 be the shortest length.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to specific cells in the table. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Instrumental version**: This refers to a specific row in the table.\n2. **Year 1986**: The version is claimed to be from 1986.\n3. **Shortest length**: We need to check if this instrumental version has the shortest duration compared to others from the same year.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row where the year is 1986 and see how their lengths compare. The relevant rows for 1986 are:\n\n- Album version: 3:49\n- Single version: 3:30\n- Long version: 4:30\n- Instrumental: 3:31\n- Remix: 4:35\n- New remix: 3:35\n- Soundtrack from the video: 3:22\n- Remix special club: 5:53\n\nWait, I also need to check if these are all from 1986. The \"live version (recorded in 2009)\" and others are different years, so they're not relevant here.\n\nNow, let's list out the lengths of the 1986 versions:\n\n- Single version: 3:30\n- Soundtrack from the video: 3:22\n- Instrumental: 3:31\n- New remix: 3:35\n\nComparing these, the shortest one is the soundtrack at 3:22. The instrumental is 3:31 and the new remix is 3:35, so they're longer than the soundtrack.\n\nWait, that's confusing because the claim says the instrumental version in 1986 is the shortest. But according to this, it's not. The single version is even shorter at 3:30, which is less than the instrumental's 3:31. So the claim is false because the instrumental isn't the shortest; there are shorter versions from 1986.\n\nI should also make sure I'm checking all possible relevant cells. The claim mentions \"instrumental version,\" so I need to find that row and see its length. In the table, it's row index 3: \"instrumental\" with a length of 3:31. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the instrumental version isn't the shortest in 1986; the soundtrack is shorter. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about the instrumental version being the shortest in 1986 is true, I examined all relevant rows for that year. The lengths of the 1986 versions are:\n\n- Single: 3:30\n- Soundtrack: 3:22\n- Instrumental: 3:31\n- New remix: 3:35\n\nThe shortest is the soundtrack at 3:22, not the instrumental version.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"length\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"instrumental\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"laurent boutonnat be the only version that be remixed in 1986.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with several columns: version, length, album, remixed by, and year. My main focus is on the \"remixed by\" column because the claim mentions laurent boutonnat remixing something in 1986.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if laurent boutonnat is the only one who did a remix that year. Let's list out all the entries for 1986:\n\n1. album version: remixed by laurent boutonnat.\n2. single version: no name listed, and remixed by is empty or not applicable.\n3. long version: remixed by laurent boutonnat.\n4. instrumental: remixed by is empty.\n5. remix: remixed by laurent boutonnat.\n6. new remix: remixed by thierry rogen.\n7. soundtrack from the video: no name listed, and remixed by is empty.\n8. remix special club: remixed by laurent boutonnat.\n9. live version (recorded in 1989): remixed by is empty.\n\nSo from this, I can see that in 1986, there are multiple entries where someone was remixed. Specifically, laurent boutonnat appears three times: album version, long version, remix, and remix special club. Additionally, there's a new remix by thierry rogen, which means another person was involved.\n\nThe claim says that laurent boutonnat is the only one who did the remixing in 1986. However, since there's another name (thierry rogen) listed for the \"new remix\" entry, that contradicts the claim. Therefore, the statement isn't entirely true because there was at least one other remixer in that year.\n\nI should also check if any other entries might affect this. For example, some rows have no name or are marked with a dash, which probably means they didn't have a remixer associated with them or it's not applicable. But the key point is that thierry rogen was involved, making the claim false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to check would be all the 1986 entries where \"remixed by\" is mentioned, specifically focusing on who did each remix to confirm if only laurent boutonnat was involved.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}",
