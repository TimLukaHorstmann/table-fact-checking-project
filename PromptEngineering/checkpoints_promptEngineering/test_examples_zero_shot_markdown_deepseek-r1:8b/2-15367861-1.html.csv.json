    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. The claim says: \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 point.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main things: Corinthians amassing 22 points and having less than 11 losses.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the team is Corinthians. Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. Row 6 has the team name as \"corinthians\" with points 22. That's the relevant row because it matches both parts of the claim: they have 22 points and some losses.\n\nNow, focusing on this row (row_index 6), I check the number of losses. The column for losses is labeled \"lost.\" According to the table, Corinthians have 10 losses.\n\nThe claim states that they receive less than 11 losses. Since 10 is indeed less than 11, this part holds true.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are met: Corinthians have 22 points and fewer than 11 losses.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 point,\" we need to check the row for Corinthians with 22 points and their number of losses.\n\n1. **Find Corinthians' Row:** The relevant row is row_index 6 where the team is Corinthians, with 22 points.\n2. **Check Losses:** In this row, the \"lost\" column shows 10 losses.\n3. **Compare to Claim:** Since 10 < 11, the claim holds.\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Corinthians scored over 25 points.\n2. Corinthians received zero losses in those games.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for Corinthians. Scanning through, I see that Corinthians are listed as \"corinthians\" in position 6 (row index 5 if we start counting from 0). Wait, actually, the table has position starting at 1, so row index 5 is position 6.\n\nIn that row, under the \"points\" column, it says 22. So their total points are 22, which is not over 25. That already contradicts the first part of the claim because they didn't score over 25 points. Therefore, the condition for checking losses doesn't apply here since they didn't meet the initial requirement.\n\nBut just to be thorough, if we assume that Corinthians did score over 25, let's check their losses. In the row for Corinthians, under \"lost\" it says 10. So they lost 10 games where they scored points over 25. Since this contradicts the claim that there are zero such losses, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but hold on, since their total points are only 22, which is less than 25, the entire statement's premise isn't met. So perhaps the main point is that because they didn't score over 25, any mention of their losses in those games isn't applicable. But still, the fact remains that in all their games, including where they scored under 25, they lost 10 times.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the claim was about when they scored over 25, regardless of whether they actually did. However, since their points are 22, which is below 25, there are no games where they scored over 25 to check for losses. So technically, there are zero losses in that category because it doesn't exist. But the claim says \"when they score over 25\", implying that such games happened, but in reality, they didn't.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me clarify: The claim is about when Corinthians scored over 25 points, and if in those instances, they lost zero times. Since Corinthians didn't score over 25 (they have 22), there are no games to check. So the number of losses in that category is zero by default because there were none.\n\nHowever, another angle is that regardless of their total points, maybe the claim is about all their games. But the wording specifies \"when they score over 25\", so it's conditional on scoring more than 25. Since they didn't reach that, the condition isn't met, and thus the statement's premise is false.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the total losses regardless of points, Corinthians lost 10 games in total, but again, the claim specifically ties it to when they scored over 25, which didn't happen.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the claim requires zero losses only in the games where they scored over 25. Since Corinthians didn't have any such games, there are no losses to consider, so technically, the condition holds (zero losses). But the overall statement's premise isn't met because they didn't score over 25.\n\nHmm, but the claim is about whether \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point\". So it's a two-part condition. First, did Corinthians score over 25? No. Second, in those games where they scored over 25, did they have zero losses? But since they didn't have any such games, does that mean the statement is technically true because there are no instances of loss to contradict it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is asserting that whenever Corinthians scored over 25 points, they didn't lose. Since they didn't score over 25, the condition doesn't apply, so the claim holds as true because there's nothing to disprove it.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this is the right way to interpret it. Another approach: If Corinthians had games where they scored over 25 and lost, then the claim would be false. But since they didn't have any such games, the claim can't be disproven, so it's true.\n\nHowever, considering that the table shows Corinthians have 10 losses in total, but all those losses likely happened when they scored less than 25 points. So the specific condition of scoring over 25 and losing doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the claim is TRUE because there are no games where Corinthians scored over 25 points to check for losses, hence zero losses in that category.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Corinthians have zero losses when they score over 25 points. From the table, Corinthians scored only 22 points, which is less than 25, so there are no relevant games to check for losses in that context. Therefore, the condition holds true as there are no instances where they lost after scoring over 25.\n\n**Answer: TRUE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
