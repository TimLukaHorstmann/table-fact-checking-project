    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's stating a condition where when there's a specific female singles player (Lindaweni Fanetri), then in the same year, the mixed doubles should have another specific pair (Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010. Each column corresponds to a type of event: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nSo, I need to find the rows where the girl singles are Lindaweni Fanetri. From the table:\n\n- In 2007, the girl singles is Lindaweni Fanetri.\n- Also, in 2007, let's check what the mixed doubles are. The column for mixed doubles shows \"wifqi windarto debby susanta\" in 2007.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the table:\n\nIn 2007 row:\n- Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri\n- Mixed doubles: wifqi windarto debby susanta\n\nSo, yes, that matches. So in 2007, when girl single is Lindawendi Fanetri, mixed doubles are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta\". The wording uses 'be', which might imply in the same year. So if a row has Lindawendi as girls singles, does it have Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta in mixed doubles?\n\nLooking at 2007: Yes. Girls singles is Lindawendi, and mixed doubles are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nWait, but I think the claim might be implying a specific pairing each time. But from the table, in 2007, that's exactly what's happening. So it seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other years where Lindawendi is the girl singles. From the table:\n\n- 2007: Lindawendi\n- Any others? Looking at the years:\n   - 2001: Maria Kristin Yulianti\n   - 2002: Fransisca Ratnasari\n   - 2003: Wiwis Meilyanna\n   - 2004: Pia Zebadiah\n   - 2005: Bellaetrix Manuputty\n   - 2006: Sylvinna Kurniawan\n   - 2007: Lindawendi\n   - 2008: Ana Rovita\n   - 2009: Ana Rovita\n   - 2010: Ganis Nur Rahmadani\n\nSo only 2007 has Lindawendi as girl singles. And in that same year, mixed doubles are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because when the girl singles are Lindawendi Fanetri (in 2007), the mixed doubles are indeed Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the year where the girl singles player is Lindawendi Fanteri has the specified mixed doubles pair.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row(s):**\n   - Look for rows where \"girls singles\" is Lindawendi Fanteri. This occurs in the 2007 row.\n\n2. **Check the mixed doubles for that year:**\n   - In the 2007 row, the mixed doubles column shows \"wifqi windarto debby susanta\".\n\nSince both conditions are met in the same year, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia , the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\" \n\nI need to look for two specific entries in the table. The first is the girl doubles entry when the girl is ayu pratiwi anggi widia, and the second is the corresponding boy doubles entry with jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, starting from 2001 to 2010. The relevant columns are 'girls doubles' and 'boys doubles'. \n\nI'll start by checking the 'girls doubles' column for any mention of ayu pratiwi anggi widia. Let's go through each year:\n\n- **2009**: Girls doubles is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\". That matches.\n- **Other years**: I don't see ayu pratiwi in other rows, so 2009 is the correct one.\n\nNow, for the corresponding boys doubles entry in 2009. Looking at the 'boys doubles' column:\n\nIn 2009, the boys doubles are \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\". That's a match.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 2007 , the girl double be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati and the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the girls' doubles in 2007 being Anneke Feinya Agustiin Wenny Setiawati. The second part mentions that the mixed doubles in 2007 are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided for the year 2007. The columns relevant here are \"girls doubles\" and \"mixed doubles.\" Let's locate these entries.\n\nLooking at row 2007:\n- Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri\n- Boys doubles: Budi Hartono Yohanes Rendy Sugiarto\n- Girls doubles: Anneke Feinya Agustiin Wenny Setiawati\n- Mixed doubles: Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Oh, I see the columns are \"girls singles,\" \"boys singles,\" \"boys doubles,\" \"girls doubles,\" and \"mixed doubles.\"\n\nSo in 2007:\n- Girls doubles: Anneke Feinya Agustiin Wenny Setiawati\n- Mixed doubles: Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto\n\nThat matches the claim exactly.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"in 2006 , the mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto and the boy single be nugroho andi saputro\". So, the user is claiming two things for the year 2006. The first part is about the mixed doubles team, and the second part is about the boys singles.\n\nNow, I need to check the table provided. The table lists each year from 2001 to 2010, along with various tennis categories: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nSince the claim refers to 2006, I'll focus on that row. Let me find where 2006 is in the table. Looking at the 'year' column, 2006 is the seventh row (index 6 if we start counting from 0).\n\nNow, for the boys singles in 2006: According to the claim, it's \"nugroho andi saputro\". I'll check the boys singles column under 2006. Looking at the table, in the boys singles row for 2006, it says \"nugroho andi saputro\". So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the mixed doubles: The claim states that the mixed double is \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto\". I need to look at the mixed doubles column for 2006. From the table, under mixed doubles in 2006, it's written as \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto\". So that also matches.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't misread anything. Sometimes names can be tricky, and maybe there are slight variations or similar names that could cause confusion. But in this case, both the boys singles and mixed doubles entries for 2006 exactly match the claim. There's no discrepancy here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Both parts of the claim about 2006's boys singles and mixed doubles are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because both the boys singles and mixed doubles for 2006 match exactly with the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the given claim is true or false by checking the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"When the girl single is Lindaweni Fanetri, the mixed double is Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto after the year 2007.\"\n\nFirst, I need to locate where Lindaweni Fanetri appears in the girls singles column. Looking at each year:\n\n- In 2001, it's Maria Kristin Yulianti.\n- 2002: Fransisca Ratnasari.\n- 2003: Wiwis Meilyanna.\n- 2004: Pia Zebadiah.\n- 2005: Bellaetrix Manuputty.\n- 2006: Sylvinna Kurniawan.\n- 2007: Lindaweni Fanetri. Okay, so she is in the girl singles for 2007.\n\nNow, I need to check the mixed doubles for the same year or later years after 2007. Wait, the claim says \"after the year 2007,\" which might mean strictly after, so 2008 onwards.\n\nLooking at 2007's row:\n\n- Girl singles: Lindaweni Fanetri.\n- Mixed doubles: Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta. Hmm, in the table, it's written as wifqi windarto debby susanto, but the claim has \"Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta.\" Wait, are they the same? Let me check.\n\nIn 2007, mixed doubles is listed as wifqi windarto debby susanto. The claim uses \"wifqi windarto debby susanta.\" There's a slight difference in the last name spelling: \"susanto\" vs \"susanta.\" Are these considered different? Probably yes, because they're distinct names.\n\nSo, in 2007, the mixed doubles are wifqi windarto debby susanto. The claim refers to \"Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta,\" which isn't exactly matching. So maybe the claim is incorrect because of the last name spelling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the time frame. Does \"after the year 2007\" mean including 2007? If it's after 2007, then we need to look at 2008 onwards.\n\nLooking at 2008:\n\n- Girl singles: Ana Rovita.\n- Mixed doubles: Irfan Fadhilah Weni Anggraeni. Doesn't match.\n\n2009:\n\n- Girl singles: Ana Rovita again.\n- Mixed doubles: Didit Juang Indrianto Yayu Rahayu.\n\n2010:\n\n- Girl singles: Ganis Nur Rahmadani.\n- Mixed doubles: Jones Ralfy Jansen Nurbeta Kwanrico.\n\nSo, after 2007, the mixed doubles don't have Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta again. They are in 2007 only. Therefore, if the claim is about when she plays girl singles, the corresponding mixed doubles would be in 2007. But the claim says \"after the year 2007,\" which might not include 2007. So that's a problem.\n\nAdditionally, there's a discrepancy in the last name spelling: susanto vs susanta. Even if the year was 2007 and included, the names don't match exactly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about when the girl single is Lindaweni Fanetri, which happens in 2007, and the mixed double being Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta after that year. But since in 2007, mixed doubles are Wifqi Windarto Debby susanto, not Susanta. So even if \"after\" includes 2007, the names don't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and the claim is correct because the spelling might be similar enough, but I think it's more accurate to consider them different. Therefore, the mixed doubles in 2007 are different from what the claim states, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"}]}",

The second part is about the boy doubles in 2010 being Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the year 2010. Let me locate the row for 2010. In that row, under \"girls doubles,\" it says \"arlis budiharti dian fitriani.\" That's not Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia. So the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, checking the boy doubles in 2010: the table shows \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\" The claim states it as \"Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita,\" which matches exactly.

The claim says: \"In 2009, the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about two things for 2009: the mixed doubles team and the boys singles. The claim states that in the mixed doubles, there are two people: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah. But wait, looking at the table, the \"mixed doubles\" column has names paired together as a single entry. So, for 2009, under mixed doubles, it's \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\". Herberman isn't listed there with him; instead, hermansyah is in the boys singles that year.\n\nWait, let me check the table again. For 2009, boys singles are riyanto subagja and hermansyah? No, looking at the table, the boys singles for 2009 is \"riyanto subagja\". Hermansyah was in the boys singles in 2008. In 2009, the boys singles are listed as \"riyanto subagja\", and hermansyah isn't there anymore.\n\nNow, regarding the mixed doubles: in 2009, the mixed doubles team is \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\". Hermansyah isn't part of that pair. So the claim says that the mixed double consists of didit and hermansyah, but that's not correct because it's only didit with someone else.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" Maybe they're pairing him with hermansyah as singles? But no, that doesn't make sense because in mixed doubles, it's a pair of one male and one female.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim might be saying that the boys singles are riyanto subagja and hermansyah, but according to the table, boys singles for 2009 is just riyanto subagja. So maybe the claim is incorrect there too.\n\nSo putting it together: In 2009, in the mixed doubles, didit is paired with yayu rahayu, not hermansyah.
