The claim says: \"the result be better in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau than in sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. There are five rows, each with information about a date, venue, result, scored, and competition.\n\nThe claim is comparing two venues: \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\" and \"sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong.\" So, I need to find the corresponding rows for these in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row has \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\" as the venue on 20 June 2010, with a result of 5-1.\n2. The fourth row mentions \"sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong\" on 26 January 2011, with a result of 1-0.\n\nWait, actually, I should check each row to see which venues match:\n\n- Row 0: venue is est\u00e1dio campo desportivo, macau. Result is 5-1.\n- Row 3: venue is sai tso wan recreation ground, hong kong. Result is 1-0.\n\nSo, the two relevant rows are row 0 and row 3. The columns needed are \"result\" for both to compare.\n\nNow, comparing their results:\n\n- For est\u00e1dio campo desportivo, macau: result is 5-1 (win).\n- For sai tso wan recreation ground, hong kong: result is 1-0 (win).\n\nWait, the claim says the result was better in Macau than in Hong Kong. \"Better\" here probably refers to a win. Both are wins, so does that mean the claim is comparing two wins? Or maybe considering which score is higher?\n\nLooking at the results:\n\n- 5-1 vs 1-0: The Macau match had a higher score (5 goals) compared to Hong Kong's 1 goal. So in terms of scoreline, Macau's result was better, as they scored more and won by a bigger margin.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the result (score) in Macau was indeed better than in Hong Kong.\n\nRelevant cells: I need to list the row indices and column names for these two venues' results. So:\n\n- Row 0, \"result\" column.\n- Row 3, \"result\" column.\n\nSo, the JSON should have answer as TRUE and include these two relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong be the venue after it be hold in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about two venues: one is \"siu sai wan sports ground\" in Hong Kong, and the other is \"estadio campo desportivo\" in Macau. The claim suggests that the venue switched from the latter to the former at some point.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, result, scored, and competition. My goal is to find if there's any data that supports or contradicts the claim about the venues switching.\n\nI'll start by checking each row for the mentioned venues in the claim. \n\nRow 0: The venue is \"estadio campo desportivo , macau\". So this matches the first part of the claim where it was held in Macau.\n\nRow 1: Venue is \"siu sai wan sports ground , hong kong\". This matches the second part of the claim, as Hong Kong is the location mentioned.\n\nWait, so does that mean after being held in Macau, it moved to Hong Kong? But looking at the table, row 0 has a date of June 20, 2010, and row 1 is November 2, 2010. So yes, the venue did switch from Macau to Hong Kong. However, I need to check if the claim says that after it was held in Macau, it became the venue in Hong Kong.\n\nThe claim states: \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong be the venue after it be hold in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\". So it's saying that the Hong Kong venue came after the Macau one. That seems to align with the table data because row 0 is Macau, and row 1 is Hong Kong, which comes later.\n\nBut wait, are there multiple matches at each venue? Let me check all rows for these two venues.\n\nLooking through all entries:\n\n- Estadio Campo Desportivo, Macau appears only in row 0.\n- Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground, Hong Kong appears in rows 1 and 2. Row 1 is November 2010, and row 2 is January 2011. So the venue in Hong Kong was used more than once.\n\nSo the claim mentions that after being held in Macau, it became the venue in Hong Kong. In the table, this shift happened from row 0 to row 1, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, does the claim specify a particular date or just a switch? The table shows multiple dates for Hong Kong, but the initial use in Macau was only once in June 2010, and then in Hong Kong starting November 2010 onwards. So yes, it did transition from Macau to Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other instances where the same venues appear again. The claim doesn't specify a timeframe beyond \"after it was held,\" so as long as there's at least one instance after, it could be considered TRUE.\n\nAnother point: the claim uses \"sport ground\" while the table has \"sports ground.\" That seems minor, just a spelling difference, so it doesn't affect the truthfulness.\n\nAlso, the claim is making a general statement about the venues switching from Macau to Hong Kong. The table supports that because row 0 is Macau and row 1 is Hong Kong with a date later in 2010.\n\nSo putting it all together, the data in the table shows that after being held in Macau (row 0), there was a match in Hong Kong (row 1). Therefore, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the 9 february 2011 game be the last game listed, and it score 1 - 4.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: date, venue, result, scored, and competition. There are five rows in total.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: that the game on 9 February 2011 is the last one listed, and that it scored 1-4. So I need to check both of these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the dates in the \"date\" column: June 2010, November 2010, January 2011, February 2011, and another June 2010. The last row is February 9, 2011. So yes, it's the fifth entry, which makes it the last one listed.\n\nNext, checking the result for that date. In the \"result\" column for 9 February 2011, it shows \"1 - 4\". That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The date is 9 February 2011, so row index is 4 (since counting starts from 0). The relevant columns are \"date\" and \"result\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"only the 26 january 2011 game in sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong score more than 0.\" So, it's saying that out of all the games listed in the table, only one specific game (on January 26, 2011, at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground in Hong Kong) had a score higher than zero. All other games should have scored zero or less.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six rows with details about each match. Each row has a date, venue, result, scored column, and competition name.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if any others have a 'scored' value greater than zero.\n\n1. **20 june 2010**: Venue is Estadio Campo Desportivo in Macau. Result is 5 - 1, but the 'scored' column shows 0. So this game's score for the team is zero.\n2. **2 november 2010**: At Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground in Hong Kong. The result is 0 - 4, and 'scored' is 0 again. No points here.\n3. **26 january 2011**: This is the game mentioned in the claim. It took place at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground in Hong Kong. The result was 1 - 0, so 'scored' is 1. That's more than zero, as stated.\n4. **9 february 2011**: Po Kong Village Park in Hong Kong hosted this match with a result of 1 - 4, and 'scored' is 0. So no points here either.\n5. **3 june 2010**: Xianghe Sports Center in Beijing had a game ending with 2 - 2. The 'scored' column shows 0 again.\n\nSo, from the table, only the January 26, 2011, game scored more than zero (specifically 1). All other games have a 'scored' value of zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because it accurately states that only this particular game scored more than zero.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"4 of 5 competition be friendly, with only 1 2010 hong kong - macau interport.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different event with details like date, venue, result, scored, and competition. My task is to verify if four out of five competitions are friendly, except for one which is the \"2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport\" competition.\n\nFirst, I'll count how many competitions are labeled as \"friendly.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n1. 20 June 2010: Competition is \"2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport.\" So this is not friendly.\n2. 2 November 2010: Competition is \"Friendly.\" This counts.\n3. 26 January 2011: Competition is \"Friendly.\" Another count.\n4. 9 February 2011: Competition is \"Friendly.\" Third count.\n5. 3 June 2010: Competition is \"Friendly.\" Fourth count.\n\nSo, there are four friendly competitions and one that's not. That seems to match the claim. Now, I need to check which cells are relevant. The claim refers to two aspects: the number of friendly competitions (4 out of 5) and specifying that only the \"2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport\" is not friendly.\n\nLooking at the table columns:\n- date: 20 June 2010\n- venue: est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\n- result: 5 - 1\n- scored: 0\n- competition: 2010 hong kong - macau interport\n\nSo, for the first part of the claim (4 friendly), I need rows where competition is \"friendly.\" These are rows 2,3,4. For the second part, confirming that only one competition is not friendly, which is row 1.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0: competition column\n- Rows 1-4: competition column (since they have either friendly or not)\n\nWait, actually, the claim says four competitions are friendly. So rows where competition is \"friendly\" are rows 2,3,4, and row 5? Wait, let me count again.\n\nRow indices start at 0, so:\n\nRow 0: Not friendly\nRow 1: Friendly (index 1)\nRow 2: Friendly (index 2)\nRow 3: Friendly (index 3)\nRow 4: Friendly (index 4)\n\nWait, the table has five rows. So row indices are 0 to 4.\n\nSo four rows have \"Friendly\" as competition, which are rows 1,2,3,4. The fifth is row 0.\n\nSo the relevant cells for the claim:\n\n- For verifying that only one is not friendly: need to check row 0's competition column.\n- For verifying that four are friendly: need to check rows 1,2,3,4's competition columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells list should include all these five cells. Each will have their respective row indices and column name \"competition.\"\n\nWait, but the example provided only includes two cells, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim has two parts: the count of friendly competitions (four) and the specific competition that's not friendly (the 2010 HK-Macau one). So for the first part, we need to check rows where competition is \"Friendly.\" For the second part, we need to check if there's exactly one row where competition is not \"Friendly.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are all five because we need to confirm both parts. Alternatively, maybe just the specific ones.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to include all relevant cells that support either part of the claim. Since four competitions are friendly, I need to check those rows (1-4). And for the non-friendly one, check row 0.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\nRow 0: competition\nRows 1-4: competition\n\nBut since each row has a single value in the competition column, maybe it's better to list all five. Alternatively, perhaps just rows where competition is specified.\n\nWait, no, the claim refers to both the number and the specific competition, so we need to check how many \"Friendly\" entries there are and that only one is not.\n\nSo, I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- All five rows' competition column because each contributes to either being friendly or not. But perhaps more specifically, for the first part of the claim (4 friendly), we need to check four rows with \"Friendly,\" which are rows 1-4. For the second part, check one row where it's not friendly (row 0). Therefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 0: competition\nRows 1-4: competition\n\nSo in JSON terms:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's only the competition column for all rows since that's where the information is used in both parts of the claim.\n\nSo the final answer should be TRUE and include these relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as there are four friendly competitions and one non-friendly. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is: \"the result be the same in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo as xianghe sport center.\" Hmm, translating that, it's saying that the result (which I assume refers to the score or outcome) at Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo is the same as Xianghe Sport Center. So, I need to check if these two venues have the same result in any of their matches.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nI'll list out each row with their details:\n\n1. **20 june 2010**: Venue - Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo, Macau; Result - 5-1; Scored - 0; Competition - 2010 Hong Kong-Macau Interport.\n2. **3 june 2010**: Venue - Xianghe Sports Center, Beijing; Result - 2-2; Scored - 0; Competition - Friendly.\n\nWait, but the claim is comparing \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo\" with \"xianghe sport center.\" So I need to find if these two venues have the same result in any of their matches.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo has a match on 20 June 2010 where the result was 5-1.\n- Xianghe Sports Center has a match on 3 June 2010 with a result of 2-2.\n\nSo, the results are different. The claim says that the result is the same in both venues, but they have different results (5-1 vs. 2-2). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. Wait, actually, since the claim is false, it means there's no support for it being true. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if any of their matches have the same result, but looking at other entries:\n\nWait, checking the venues again: Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo appears only once with a result of 5-1. Xianghe Sports Center appears once with a result of 2-2. No match here shows the same result.\n\nTherefore, there are no cells where both have the same result. Hence, relevant_cells would be empty because there's no evidence to support the claim.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to identify the cells that are relevant to verify the claim. So if I'm checking whether the results are the same, I need to look at the \"result\" column for both venues.\n\nIn row 0 (index 0), the result is 5-1.\nIn row 4 (index 4), the result is 2-2.\n\nSo these two rows have different results. Therefore, comparing them shows that the claim is false.\n\nThus, to verify the claim, I need to check the \"result\" column for both Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo and Xianghe Sport Center.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong be the venue before it be hold in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\". It seems to suggest that the venue in Hong Kong was used before the one in Macau. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to check for any matches where the venue is \"siu sai wan sport ground\" and another entry with \"estadio campo desportivo\" as the venue. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is \"estadio campo desportivo , macau\". So this is the Macau venue mentioned in the claim.\n- Row 1: Venue is \"siu sai wan sports ground , hong kong\". This matches exactly with what's in the claim.\n- Row 2: Different venue, so not relevant.\n- Row 3: Different venue again, so no.\n- Row 4: Another venue, not the one mentioned.\n\nSo, there's a match between row 1 and row 0. The claim says that the Hong Kong venue was used before the Macau one. But in the table, the Hong Kong venue (row 1) is on November 2, 2010, while the Macau venue (row 0) is on June 20, 2010. Wait, but row 0's date is earlier than row 1's. So actually, the Macau venue was used before the Hong Kong one, which contradicts the claim.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says that the Hong Kong venue was used before the Macau one. But in reality, the Macau venue (row 0) is June 2010, and the Hong Kong venue (row 1) is November 2010. So actually, the Macau venue was earlier.\n\nSo this means the claim's assertion about the order of venues is incorrect because the Macau venue was held before the Hong Kong one, not vice versa. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: We need to check if there are two entries where one has \"siu sai wan sports ground\" and another has \"estadio campo desportivo\". So rows 1 and 0. Their respective columns for venue are both present.\n\nSo, in terms of JSON structure, I need to list each row's index and the column name relevant to the claim. Since the claim mentions both venues, the relevant cells are row 1 (venue) and row 0 (venue).\n\nBut wait, the problem says to check if the claim is fully supported. Since the claim's order is incorrect, it's not fully supported. Therefore, answer is FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the two venue columns for those rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that the Hong Kong venue was used before the Macau one, but the table shows the Macau event occurred earlier.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Hong Kong score more than 1 on 26 January 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and identify which rows are relevant. The claim mentions a specific date: 26 January 2011. So I need to find that row in the table. Scanning through the dates:\n\n- 20 June 2010\n- 2 November 2010\n- 26 January 2011 (this is our target)\n- 9 February 2011\n- 3 June 2010\n\nSo, the relevant row is the third one with date 26 January 2011.\n\nNext, I need to check which columns are important here. The claim talks about \"Hong Kong scoring more than 1.\" Looking at the table headers: date, venue, result, scored, competition.\n\nThe \"scored\" column seems directly related because it shows the points scored by Hong Kong in each match. So, for the 26 January 2011 row, I should look at the \"scored\" value.\n\nLooking at that specific row:\n| 26 january 2011 | sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong | 1 - 0 |        1 | friendly                         |\n\nSo, in this case, the scored column has a value of 1. The claim says Hong Kong scored more than 1 (i.e., greater than 1). Since the scored value is exactly 1, it's not more than 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Hong Kong did not score more than 1 on that date. They scored 1 point, which is equal to 1 but not more than 1.\n\nNow, I need to map this out in JSON as per the instructions. The relevant cells are the ones that confirm the claim's details. In this case, it's the row with the specific date and the \"scored\" column.\n\nSo, the \"relevant_cells\" should include the row index (which is 2 since it's the third row, starting from 0) and the column name \"scored\".\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with answer as \"FALSE\" and the relevant cell specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"scored\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a game is true or false by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"the game play 9 february 2011 finish with a score 2 - 2.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the relevant information in the table that pertains to the claim. Let's break down what the claim is stating. It mentions a specific date (9 February 2011), a game result of \"2-2\", and refers to it as a \"game play.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like date, venue, result, scored, and competition. I need to find the row where the date is 9 February 2011.\n\nScrolling through the rows:\n1. The first row is 20 June 2010 \u2013 not relevant.\n2. Second row: 2 November 2010 \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: 26 January 2011 \u2013 still not.\n4. Fourth row: 9 February 2011 \u2013 this matches the date in the claim.\n\nNow, check the result column for that row. The result is listed as \"1 - 4.\" That's different from what the claim states, which is a score of \"2-2.\"\n\nSo, the result doesn't match. The game on 9 February 2011 ended with a score of 1-4, not 2-2.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other columns like venue and competition might provide more context, but since the result directly contradicts the claim, that's sufficient to determine it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game on 9 February 2011 ended with a score of 2-2. However, according to the table, the result was actually 1-4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"none of the competition be friendly\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means.\n\nThe claim says that none of the competitions listed in the table are friendly. So, I have to check each competition's type in the table and see if any of them are marked as \"friendly.\" If there are any friendly competitions, then the claim is false; otherwise, it's true.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: date, venue, result, scored, and competition. The 'competition' column seems to indicate the name or type of the event. For example, in row 0, the competition is \"2010 hong kong - macau interport,\" which doesn't mention being friendly. Then, looking at rows 1 through 4:\n\n- Row 2: \"friendly\"\n- Row 3: \"friendly\"\n- Row 4: \"friendly\"\n\nSo, in these three cases, the competition is explicitly stated as friendly.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm checking each relevant cell. The claim is about the competition type, so the relevant column is 'competition.' So, for each row, if the competition is \"friendly,\" that makes the statement false because there are competitions that are friendly.\n\nTherefore, since there are rows where the competition is friendly, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because multiple competitions in the table are marked as friendly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
