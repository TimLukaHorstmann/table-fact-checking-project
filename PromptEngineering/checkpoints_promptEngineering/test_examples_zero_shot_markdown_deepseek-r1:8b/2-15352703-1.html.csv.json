    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in markdown. The table has several columns: round, pick, player name, position, and college. My task is to find if there's a draft pick number 155 from Arizona University. \n\nI'll start by scanning each row for the pick number 155. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- Round 1, pick 16: James Williams from Fresno State.\n- Round 2, pick 43: Carwell Gardner from Louisville.\n- Round 3, pick 70: Glenn Parker from Arizona.\n- Round 4, pick 101: Eddie Fuller from LSU.\n- Then, I see round 6, pick 155. The player is John Nies, and his college is listed as Arizona.\n\nSo, the draft pick number 155 is indeed in row 5 (since it's zero-indexed, but wait, no\u2014wait, the first row is index 0 or 1? Let me check the table again. The rounds start at 1, so maybe the rows are also numbered starting at 1. Wait, looking at the example given in the problem statement, the JSON uses \"row_index\" as an integer, but it's unclear if they're zero-indexed or one-indexed.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem doesn't specify whether row indices start at 0 or 1, but from the table, it starts with round 1, pick 16. So in the JSON example, the first entry is row_index 0, which would correspond to round 1. So perhaps the rows are zero-indexed.\n\nWait, no, in the example given, the answer has relevant cells like {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}, implying that row indices start at 0 for the first row. So in our case, round 1 is row index 0, round 2 is index 1, and so on.\n\nSo pick number 155 is in round 6, which would be row index 5 (since round starts at 1, so row 0 is round 1, row 1 is round 2, etc.).\n\nLooking back at the table:\nRow 0: Round 1\nRow 1: Round 2\nRow 2: Round 3\nRow 3: Round 4\nRow 4: Round 6 (pick 155)\nSo yes, pick 155 is in row index 5? Wait, wait\u2014rounds go from 1 to 11, but in the table, after round 4 comes round 6, skipping some. So row indices are based on the order of rounds as they appear.\n\nWait no\u2014the table lists multiple rows with different round numbers. For example, round 7 has three entries (players), and so on. The pick number 155 is in row 5 if we count each row, regardless of the round number.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: Round 1\nRow 1: Round 2\nRow 2: Round 3\nRow 3: Round 4\nRow 4: Round 6\nRow 5: Round 7 (first entry)\nRow 6: Round 7 (second entry)\nRow 7: Round 7 (third entry)\nRow 8: Round 8\nRow 9: Round 9\nRow 10: Round 10\nRow 11: Round 11\n\nSo pick number 155 is in row index 5, which corresponds to round 6.\n\nNow, looking at the column \"college\" for that row. In row 4 (assuming I'm counting correctly), wait no\u2014the pick 155 is in round 6, which would be row index 5. So let me check the data:\n\nLooking again:\n- Row 0: Round 1, Pick 16\n- Row 1: Round 2, Pick 43\n- Row 2: Round 3, Pick 70\n- Row 3: Round 4, Pick 101\n- Row 4: Round 6, Pick 155, Player John Nies, College Arizona.\n\nYes, so the college is Arizona for pick 155. \n\nNow, the claim says \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university.\" But in the table, it's listed as \"arizona\" without the word \"university,\" but that's probably acceptable because \"Arizona\" is a common name for the university.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because pick 155 comes from Arizona. \n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any other entries for pick 155 in the table. Looking through each row:\n\n- Round 1: 16\n- Round 2:43\n- Round3:70\n- Round4:101\n- Round6:155 (John Nies)\n- Round7:167,171,182\n- Round8:209\n- Round9:239\n- Round10:266\n- Round11:293\n\nNo other pick 155s. So only one entry for pick 155, which is from Arizona.\n\nSo the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim suggests that Arizona is the college with the last draft pick in the list provided. To verify this, I should check which colleges are listed and their corresponding picks to see if any of them have the highest number, indicating a later draft pick.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different round (from 1 to 11), along with the player's pick number, the player's name, their position, and their college. The key here is the 'pick' column because higher numbers usually indicate later picks in the draft.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the colleges:\n\n- Round 1: Fresno State (pick 16)\n- Round 2: Louisville (pick 43)\n- Round 3: Arizona (pick 70)\n- Round 4: LSU (101)\n- Round 6: Arizona again (155)\n- Round 7: Minnesota-Duluth (167), Carson-Newman (171), Syracuse (182)\n- Round 8: UCLA (209)\n- Round 9: Duke (239)\n- Round 10: UCLA again (266)\n- Round 11: Northwestern State, LA (293)\n\nNow, looking at the pick numbers:\n\n16, 43, 70, 101, 155, 167, 171, 182, 209, 239, 266, 293.\n\nThe highest number here is 293, which corresponds to Northwestern State, LA in round 11. So Arizona's picks are at 70 and 155, which aren't the highest. Therefore, the claim that Arizona has the last draft pick is false because their pick numbers are much lower than 293.\n\nI need to identify all the relevant cells that show this. The 'college' column for each row where the college is Arizona is relevant. From the table:\n\n- Round 3: Arizona with pick 70\n- Round 6: Arizona again with pick 155\n\nSo, these are the two rows that list Arizona. Therefore, these are the relevant cells to check.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the highest draft pick in the table is Northwestern State, LA at 293, not Arizona.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
