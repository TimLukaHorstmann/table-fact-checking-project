    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the game against iowa take place at memorial stadium , minneapolis , mn.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a game against Iowa, and it specifies that the location was Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. My task is to find any relevant cells in this table that can verify the claim.\n\nI should start by locating the games where the opponent is Iowa. So I'll go through each row's opponent column:\n\n- The first game (09/26/1931) was against North Dakota State.\n- Second game: Ripon.\n- Third: Oklahoma A&M.\n- Fourth: Stanford.\n- Fifth: Iowa \u2013 this seems relevant because the opponent matches the claim.\n- Then: Wisconsin, Northwestern, Cornell (IA), Michigan, and Ohio State.\n\nSo, the fifth row is where Iowa was the opponent. Now, I need to check what the site for that game was. The site column says \"memorial stadium minneapolis , mn.\" That's exactly what the claim states\u2014the location was Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nTherefore, this specific cell directly supports the claim because both the opponent and the site match the claim's details. So, I think the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a game against Michigan is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the game against michigan take place at memorial stadium , minneapolis , mn.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any games involving Michigan. Let me scan each row's opponent column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. North Dakota State\n2. Ripon\n3. Oklahoma A&M\n4. Stanford\n5. Iowa\n6. Wisconsin\n7. Northwestern\n8. Cornell (IA)\n9. Michigan\n10. Ohio State\n\nOkay, row 9 has Michigan as the opponent. Now I need to check where that game was held.\n\nThe 'site' column for each game is important here. For row 9, site is \"michigan stadium ann arbor , mi.\" So the game against Michigan took place at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, MI.\n\nBut the claim says it was at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN. That doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but I should double-check all games to make sure there's no other mention of Michigan that might have a different venue. Only row 9 has Michigan as the opponent, and its site is Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row 9, the columns 'opponent' (to confirm it's Michigan) and 'site' (to check if it's Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis).\n\nI think that's all. So the claim is FALSE because the game against Michigan was at a different location.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
