    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what the claim means. It seems to say that icarly was nominated for more awards than it actually won.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award with details like year, award name, category, work, and result (either \"won\" or \"nominated\"). My task is to find out if icarly has been nominated more times than it's won.\n\nI'll start by going through each row:\n\n1. **2009**: Award is \"teen choice awards\", category is \"choice tv actor : comedy\". Work is icarly, result is \"nominated\".\n2. **2010**: There are two entries. The first is \"big kid award\" with result \"nominated\". The second is \"lol award\" shared with an ensemble, where the result is \"won\".\n3. **2011**: First entry is \"nick uk's funniest person\", won. Second entry is \"funniest character\", nominated.\n4. **2012**: \"favorite tv sidekick\", nominated.\n5. **2013**: \"outstanding performer in an animated program\", nominated.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of times icarly was nominated and how many times it won.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Nominated entries: 2009, 2010 (big kid award), 2011 (funniest character), 2012 (sidekick). That's 5 nominations.\n- Won entries: 2010 (lol award) and 2011. So that's 2 wins.\n\nWait, no, the table for 2010 has two separate entries. The first is \"big kid award\" with result \"nominated\", and the second is \"lol award\" where they won. Then in 2011, another win.\n\nSo total nominations: 2009 (1), 2010 (big kid) (2), 2011 (funniest character) (3), 2012 (sidekick) (4). Wait, that's four? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row where work is icarly:\n\n- 2009: nominated (1)\n- 2010, first entry: nominated (2)\n- 2010, second entry: won (no count here for nomination)\n- 2011, first entry: won (no count)\n- 2011, second entry: nominated (3)\n- 2012: nominated (4)\nSo total nominations are 4.\n\nWins: 2010 lol award and 2011 nick's funniest person. So 2 wins.\n\nThe claim is that icarly was nominated for more awards than it won. So, if they were nominated more times than they won, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut in this case, they were nominated 4 times and won twice. So 4 > 2, which means the number of nominations is higher than wins.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"nominated for more award than the show win\". Does that mean total nominations (across categories) are greater than total wins? Yes.\n\nTherefore, since 4 > 2, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that icarly was nominated for more awards than it won. Based on the table, icarly has been nominated 4 times and won twice. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns: year, award, category, work, and result. Each row represents a different award or nomination for two shows: icarly and tuff puppy.\n\nI need to check if the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. The claim mentions that \"tuff\" is the only other show nominated aside from \"icarly.\" So, I should verify whether there are any other shows besides these two that have been nominated or awarded.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 2009: icarly was nominated.\n- 2010: Two entries for icarly (nominated and won).\n- 2011: Both icarly and tuff puppy. Icarly was nominated, and tuff puppy was also won in one category but I see that it's under the same year as another award for icarly.\nWait, no, looking closer, the 2011 row shows two different awards: one where icarly is nominated, and another where tuff puppy is awarded.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\n2009: One nomination for icarly.\n\n2010: Two entries: both are for icarly. The first is a nomination, the second is a win in \"lol award\" shared with ensemble.\n\n2011: First entry is for icarly, nominated in \"nick uk's funniest person.\" Second entry is for tuff puppy, which was won in \"funniest character.\"\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at 2011:\n\nFirst row: meus pr\u00e3\u00a3oios nick brazil (translated as Nick Brazil Kids' Choice Awards) for icarly, nominated.\n\nSecond row for 2011: 2011 uk kids' choice awards, tuff puppy won.\n\nSo in 2011, both shows are involved. So far, only two shows: icarly and tuff puppy.\n\nIn 2012: icarly was nominated for \"favorite tv sidekick.\"\n\nIn 2013: tuff puppy was nominated for \"outstanding performer in an animated program.\"\n\nWait, but looking at the table again:\n\nThe last row is 2013, where tuff puppy was nominated. So from 2009 to 2013, only icarly and tuff puppy are mentioned.\n\nSo the claim says that tuff is the only other show besides icarly that was nominated. But wait, in 2011, both shows were involved. So tuff puppy was also a winner there. Now, does the table show any other shows being nominated or awarded?\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- In 2009: Only icarly.\n- 2010: Only icarly.\n- 2011: Both icarly and tuff puppy.\n- 2012: Only icarly.\n- 2013: Only tuff puppy.\n\nSo, in all the rows provided, only these two shows are involved. Therefore, the claim that \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly\" is correct because there's no mention of any third show being nominated or awarded.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if the claim says that tuff is the only other show besides icarly, so yes, it's correct as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the table data provided. Only two shows, icarly and tuff puppy, are mentioned in the nominations and awards.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table data.\n\nThe claim states: \"Jerry Traino was nominated for 2 awards in 2010 and 2 awards in 2011, winning only 1 in each year.\" Hmm, I need to check if Jerry Traino (which I think is \"icarly\" from the table) indeed had two nominations in 2010, two in 2011, and won one each.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. The columns are: year, award, category, work, result. \n\nStarting with 2010:\n- First row for 2010: Award is \"big kid award\", work is icarly, result is nominated.\n- Second row for 2010: Award is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\", work is icarly, result is won.\n\nSo in 2010, Jerry was either nominated or won. Wait, but the claim says he was nominated for 2 awards. But here, he's only awarded once (the lol award) and another nomination (big kid). So that's two nominations in 2010: big kid and lol award.\n\nIn 2011:\n- Third row: Award is \"nick uk's funniest person\", work is icarly, result is won.\n- Fourth row: Award is \"funniest character\", work is icarly, result is nominated.\n\nSo again, two awards in 2011: one win and one nomination. That matches the claim of being nominated for two and winning one each year.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if it's two nominations in 2010. The first row is \"nominated\" and the second is \"won\", so that's one nom and one win. So total of two awards (both categories) in 2010: both related to icarly. Similarly for 2011.\n\nSo, in 2010: two awards (two different categories), same for 2011. Each year, he was nominated for two awards but only won one each. Wait, no: in 2010, he was either nominated or won\u2014so two awards (nominated and won). Similarly, in 2011, two awards (won and nominated).\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold. He had two awards each in 2010 and 2011, with one win per year.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table again for 2010: are there only two rows for 2010? Yes. So that's two awards for icarly in 2010. Similarly, in 2011, two awards. Therefore, he had two nominations and a win each year as claimed.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells would be all the rows where \"icarly\" is the work, especially those in 2010 and 2011.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out based on the table data provided.

Let me go through each year one by one.\n\nStarting with 2009, the category is \"choice tv actor : comedy\" and the work is \"icarly.\" That doesn't seem relevant here because neither of the award names mentioned in the claim appear.\n\nIn 2010, there are two entries. The first is the \"big kid award,\" which again isn't related. The second is the \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" where icarly won. This matches one of the awards in the claim.\n\nMoving to 2011, there's the \"nick uk kids' choice awards\" category where icarly won as \"nick uk's funniest person.\" That's the second award mentioned in the claim.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the categories don't match either, so those can be ignored for this check.\n\nSo, from the table, Jerry Traino (icarly) won two awards: one in 2010 for the lol award and another in 2011 for nick uk's funniest person.

Both rows have \"icarly\" as the work, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, looking at the categories for 2010, there are two distinct categories: \"big kid award\" and \"lol award\".

Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and comparing it to the table data.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It seems to suggest that there's a show named \"tuff\" which was nominated for an award, and perhaps that this might be the only nomination or something similar. Looking at the table, I should look for any entries where the work is \"tuff puppy.\"\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n- 2009: The work listed is \"icarly.\"\n- 2010: Also mentions \"icarly.\"\n- 2011: Again, \"icarly\" and \"funniest character.\"\n- 2012: \"icarly.\"\n- 2013: Here, the work is \"tuff puppy.\"\n\nSo in 2013, there's a nomination for \"tuff puppy.\" Now, checking the result column for that row, it says \"nominated.\" So \"tuff puppy\" was indeed nominated.\n\nNow, looking back at the claim. It says \"tuff be the only show nominate.\" I think this might mean that \"tuff\" was the only show to get a nomination. Let me check if any other work is also named \"tuff.\"\n\nFrom the table, in 2013, the category is \"outstanding performer in an animated program,\" and the result is \"nominated.\" No other entries mention \"tuff\" as the work.\n\nSo it seems that only \"tuff puppy\" was nominated, and there's no indication of another show with the same name or any others named \"tuff.\" Therefore, if the claim is stating that \"tuff\" was the only show to be nominated, that would be true based on this data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"work\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"icarly be nominate for 10 time as many award as the show win.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's stating that icarly has been nominated for 10 times more awards than the number of awards the show has won. So I need to count how many times icarly was nominated and compare it to how many times the show (which is \"The Tuff Puppy\" in the last entry) won.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award, categorized by year. The relevant columns for this analysis are \"award,\" \"category,\" \"work,\" and \"result.\" Specifically, I need to focus on rows where the work is \"icarly\" because that's the entity being nominated or won, and also see when the show itself won an award.\n\nSo starting with icarly's nominations: in 2009, it was nominated. In 2010, there are two entries: one where it was nominated for the Big Kid Award and another where it won the Lol Award. So that's two nominations. In 2011, it was nominated again for the Meus Pr\u00e3\u00a3o Nick Brazil award. Then in 2012, it was nominated once more. So adding those up: 2009 (nominated), 2010 (two nominations), 2011 (one), and 2012 (one). That totals to 5 nominations.\n\nNow, looking for the show's wins: The only row where \"tuff puppy\" is the work is in 2013 under the Daytime Emmy Awards. The result there is \"nominated,\" not a win. So the show hasn't won any awards; it was just nominated once.\n\nSo according to the table, icarly has been nominated 5 times, while the show hasn't won any awards. The claim says icarly was nominated for 10 times as many awards as the show won. Since the show didn't win any, 10 times zero would be zero. But icarly has five nominations, which is more than zero, so the claim isn't accurate.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the table. The last row is for 2013, where \"tuff puppy\" is the work and it's nominated. So no wins there. Any other entries? Checking each row:\n\n- 2009: icarly nominated\n- 2010: two nominations (Big Kid Award and Lol Award)\n- 2011: one nomination (Meus Pr\u00e3o Nick Brazil)\n- 2012: one nomination (Favorite TV Sidekick)\n\nSo that's five total. The show never won an award, so the ratio is 5 to 0. But the claim says 10 times as many, which would require icarly being nominated tenfold compared to the show's wins. Since there are no wins, it's a bit of a trick question because 10 times zero is still zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because icarly was not nominated ten times more than the show won (since the show didn't win any).\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because icarly has only been nominated five times, while the show hasn't won any awards. Therefore, the claim that it's been nominated 10 times as many as the show won is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

So maybe \"icarly\" refers to Jerry Traino? Or perhaps it's another name.\n\nI need to check if any of these awards are for Jerry Traino.

Moreover, in both years, he won all those nominations. \n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check each row to see if it pertains to Jerry Traino. The table has several columns: year, award, category, work, and result.\n\nStarting with 2010:\n- There are two entries for 2010.\n1. \"2010 Australian kids' choice awards\" \u2013 category is \"big kid award,\" work is \"icarly,\" result is \"nominated.\"\n2. Another entry for 2010 is \"2010 Australian kids' choice awards,\" category is \"lol award (shared with ensemble),\" work is \"icarly,\" result is \"won.\"\n\nSo in 2010, icarly was nominated for two awards. The first was the big kid award, which he didn't win, and the second was the lol award, which he won.\n\nBut wait, the claim says Jerry Traino was nominated for two awards in 2010 and won both. However, from the table, icarly is the work, not explicitly mentioning Jerry Traino. I'm assuming that \"icarly\" refers to Jerry Traino's character or his role, so it's reasonable to consider him as the subject here.\n\nSo in 2010, he was nominated for two awards: big kid and lol award. He won one of them (lol) but not the other (big kid). Therefore, he didn't win both, which contradicts the claim that he \"won both in each year.\"\n\nMoving on to 2011:\n- There are two entries for 2011.\n1. \"2011 UK kids' choice awards\" \u2013 category is \"nick uk's funniest person,\" work is \"icarly,\" result is \"won.\"\n2. \"Meus pr\u00e3\u00a3oos nick brazil\" \u2013 category is \"funniest character,\" work is \"icarly,\" result is \"nominated.\"\n\nSo in 2011, icarly (Jerry Traino) won one award and was nominated for another. The claim states he was nominated for two awards and won both, but according to the table, he only won one and was nominated for another. Therefore, this also doesn't align with the claim.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the categories. Maybe \"nick uk's funniest person\" is a separate award, and \"funniest character\" is another, both in 2011. So that would be two awards, but he only won one and was nominated for the other. The claim says he won both, which isn't accurate.\n\nPutting it all together: In 2010, he was nominated for two awards but only won one. In 2011, he was awarded one and nominated for another. Therefore, the claim that he \"won both in each year\" is FALSE because he didn't win both in either year.\n\nNow, regarding which cells are relevant: I need to identify all rows where Jerry Traino (icarly) was involved, specifically looking at nominations and results.\n\nIn 2009, it's about teen choice awards, which isn't his, so not relevant. In 2010, two entries: both involve icarly, so their columns are \"award\" (2010 Australian kids' choice awards), \"category,\" \"work,\" and \"result.\" Similarly for 2011, both entries pertain to icarly.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all rows where \"icarly\" is listed as \"work\" in 2010 and 2011. Each of these will have their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Traino (represented by \"icarly\") was nominated for two awards each in 2010 and 2011, and won both. However, the table shows he only won one award in each year, not all. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"in 2008 jerry traino be nominate for the 2008 australian kids' choice award in 2 different category.\" So, the key points here are:\n\n1. The year is 2008.\n2. The person is Jerry Traino.\n3. He was nominated for the 2008 Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\n4. In two different categories.\n\nNow, I need to look at the table provided and see if there's any data that matches these points.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various years, awards, categories, works, and results. The rows are from 2009 onwards. Wait, the claim mentions 2008, but the table starts with 2009. That might be a red flag because if Jerry Traino was nominated in 2008, there should be an entry for that year. But the table doesn't have a 2008 row.\n\nNext, I need to check if Jerry Traino is listed as the 'work' in any of the rows. Scanning through the 'work' column: icarly, tuff puppy, etc. I don't see \"Jerry Traino\" here. So that's another point against the claim.\n\nAdditionally, even if there were a 2008 row, it would need to show two different categories where Jerry was nominated. Since the table doesn't include 2008 and doesn't list Jerry as the work, this information isn't present.\n\nPutting this all together: The claim mentions a year not covered by the table, a person not listed as the work, and two categories without supporting data. So, there's no evidence to support the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
