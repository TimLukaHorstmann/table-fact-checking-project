    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the score of the game with manu gin\u00f3bili (44) as the lead scorer be 100 - 99\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's looking for a specific game where Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points and was the leading scorer, and that the score was 100-99. So I need to look through each row of the table to find such an instance.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows. Each row has columns: date, visitor, score, home, leading scorer, attendance, and record. The relevant columns for this claim are 'leading scorer' and 'score'. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **February 5, 2008**: Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 19 points. Score is 116-89. Doesn't match.\n2. **February 6, 2008**: Tim Duncan again with 23 points. Score 85-77. Not the game we're looking for.\n3. **February 8, 2008**: Tim Duncan, 21 points. Score 99-93. No.\n4. **February 10, 2008**: Tim Duncan, 22 points. Score 90-98. Doesn't fit.\n5. **February 11, 2008**: Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points. Score is 93-88. Not our target score.\n6. **February 13, 2008**: Manu Gin\u00f3bili again, this time scoring 46 points. The score is 112-105. So the score here doesn't match 100-99.\n7. **February 19, 2008**: Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 18 points. Score is 65-85. Not relevant.\n8. **February 21, 2008**: Manu Gin\u00f3bili scores 44 points. The score here is 100-99. Wait, that's exactly the score we're looking for! So this seems to be the game in question.\n\n9. **February 23, 2008**: Manu scored 30 points. Score is 89-98. Not relevant.\n10. **February 25, 2008**: Tim Duncan again, 23 points. Score 74-89. Doesn't fit.\n11. **February 28, 2008**: Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 31 points. Score 94-97. No.\n\nSo the game on February 21, 2008, when Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points and led his team to a 100-99 victory over the Timberwolves, matches the claim exactly.\n\nI need to make sure that this is the correct row. Let me cross-check the details: date, visitor (Timberwolves), score (100-99), home (Spurs), leading scorer (Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 44 points). Yes, all these align with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are in row_index 7 (since rows start at index 0, February 21, 2008 is the 8th row, which would be row index 7) for both 'score' and 'leading scorer'. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking back, the table starts with february 5 as row 0. So let me count the rows:\n\n1. Feb 5: 0\n2. Feb 6:1\n3. Feb8:2\n4. Feb10:3\n5. Feb11:4\n6. Feb13:5\n7. Feb19:6\n8. Feb21:7\n9. Feb23:8\n10. Feb25:9\n11. Feb28:10\n\nYes, so February 21 is row index 7. The columns relevant are 'score' and 'leading scorer', which correspond to column indices 2 and 3 (since the first column is date, then visitor, then score, home, leading scorer, attendance, record). So for row 7, the score is in column 2 and leading scorer in column 3.\n\nSo relevant_cells would be two objects: one for row_index 7, column_name 'score' and another for row_index 7, column_name 'leading scorer'.\n\nI think that's it. The claim is fully supported by this data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim says: \"raptor be the home team of the game with manu gin\u00f3bili (34) as the lead scorer.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. The home team was raptors.\n2. The leading scorer was Manu Gin\u00f3bili with a score of 34.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row to see if any match both conditions.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the first row (row index 0):\n- Home team: pacers\n- Leading scorer: Tim Duncan (19)\nNot matching either condition.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home: wizards\n- Scorer: Tim Duncan, not Manu Gin\u00f3bili.\nNo match.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home: knicks\n- Scorer: Tim Duncan again. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home: celtics\n- Scorer: Tim Duncan (22)\nStill not matching.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home: raptors\n- Leading scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points.\nThis seems to match both parts of the claim.\n\nWait, but I should check all rows just in case there's another entry. Let me continue.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home: timberwolves\n- Scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44). Score is different from 34.\nNot matching.\n\nRow 6:\n- Home: hornets\n- Scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili (30)\nDifferent score, so no.\n\nRow 7:\n- Home: hawks\n- Scorer: Tim Duncan (23)\nNope.\n\nRow 8:\n- Home: mavericks\n- Scorer: Tim Duncan (31)\nNot matching.\n\nSo the only row that matches both conditions is row index 4. Therefore, I need to mark that as relevant.\n\nWait, but the user's example shows a list of objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So for this case, the relevant cells are where home team is raptors and leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34). Looking back at row 4, columns are:\n- date: february 10 , 2008\n- visitor: spurs\n- score: 90 - 98\n- home: celtics? Wait no. Wait, looking again.\n\nWait no, in row index 4:\n\nWait let me recheck the table. The fifth entry is:\n| february 11 , 2008 | spurs     | 93 - 88   | raptors      | manu gin\u00f3bili (34) |        19800 | 33 - 17  |\n\nAh, row index 5? Wait no, looking back at the table.\n\nWait in the markdown table:\n\nThe rows are:\n\n0: feb 5: home pacers\n1: feb6: wizards\n2: feb8: knicks\n3: feb10: celtics\n4: feb11: raptors\nSo row index 4 corresponds to feb11, where home is raptors and scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34). So the columns for that row are:\n\n- date: february 11 , 2008\n- visitor: spurs\n- score: 93 - 88\n- home: raptors\n- leading scorer: manu gin\u00f3bili (34)\n- attendance: 19800\n- record: 33 - 17\n\nSo the relevant cells are where \"home\" is raptors and leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points. So in this row, columns would be:\n\ncolumn name: \"home\", row index:4.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions both home team and leading scorer. So I need to check if any cell has home as raptors AND leading scorer as Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34). That's only in row 4.\n\nSo in this case, I should include that specific row's \"home\" column as relevant. Alternatively, perhaps the date or other columns are needed? The instructions say to list the cells that are relevant to verify each condition. So for the home team being raptors, we look at the \"home\" column; for the leading scorer being Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34), we look at the \"leading scorer\" column.\n\nTherefore, I need to include both columns from row 4: one for home being raptors and another for the leading scorer being Manu with 34 points. But in the table, each row has multiple cells, but only two are relevant here.\n\nSo the \"home\" cell is at row index 4, column \"home\". The leading scorer cell is also at row index 4, column \"leading scorer\".\n\nWait no, in the markdown table, the columns are date, visitor, score, home, leading scorer, attendance, record. So each row's cells correspond to these.\n\nSo for row index 4, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For home team: cell under \"home\" column at row 4.\n- For leading scorer: cell under \"leading scorer\" column at row 4.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON response, I need to list both as relevant cells. So two objects: one with row_index 4 and column_name \"home\", another with row_index 4 and column_name \"leading scorer\".\n\nBut wait, the claim is a single statement, so maybe both conditions are checked in the same row. Therefore, the relevant cells are the home team and leading scorer from that specific game.\n\nHence, the answer is TRUE because such a game exists where raptors were home and Manu scored 34.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have \"answer\": \"TRUE\" and the two relevant cells as mentioned.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row of the table for both conditions: whether the home team was the Raptors and whether Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 34 points. Only one game meets both criteria on February 11, 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific game is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"when manu gin\u00f3bili (44) be the leading scorer and the visitor be the maverick , the date be february 28 , 2008\". \n\nFirst, I should break down each part of the claim to check against the table.\n\nStarting with the leading scorer: the claim mentions \"manu gin\u00f3bili (44)\". Looking at the table, I need to find rows where the leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with points mentioned as 44. \n\nNext, the visitor team should be the Mavericks. So I'm looking for a row where the visitor is listed as Mavericks.\n\nFinally, the date should be February 28, 2008. \n\nLet me go through each row in the table to find the relevant data:\n\n1. **February 5, 2008**: Visitor is Spurs, leading scorer is Tim Duncan (19). Doesn't match.\n2. **February 6, 2008**: Visitor is Spurs, leading scorer is Tim Duncan (23). No.\n3. **February 8, 2008**: Visitor is Knicks, leading scorer is Tim Duncan (21). Not relevant.\n4. **February 10, 2008**: Visitor is Celtics, leading scorer is Tim Duncan (22). No.\n5. **February 11, 2008**: Visitor is Raptors, leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34). Close but not 44 and visitor isn't Mavericks.\n6. **February 13, 2008**: Visitor is Cavaliers, leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (46). Not the right points or team.\n7. **February 19, 2008**: Visitor is Spurs, leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (18). Points are too low and visitor isn't Mavericks.\n8. **February 21, 2008**: Visitor is Timberwolves, leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44). Close but not Mavericks.\n9. **February 23, 2008**: Visitor is Hornets, leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (30). No match.\n10. **February 25, 2008**: Visitor is Hawks, leading scorer is Tim Duncan (23). Doesn't fit.\n11. **February 28, 2008**: Visitor is Mavericks, leading scorer is Tim Duncan (31). Wait, the leading scorer here isn't Manu Gin\u00f3bili but Tim Duncan.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So in February 28, 2008, the visitor is Mavericks, and the leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 31 points. The claim says the leading scorer should be Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44). Therefore, this row doesn't match the claim either.\n\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row again, especially focusing on when the visitor is Mavericks.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Only February 28, 2008 has the visitor as Mavericks.\n- On that date, the leading scorer was Tim Duncan with 31 points, not Manu Gin\u00f3bili.\n\nTherefore, there's no row in the table where both conditions are met: visitor is Mavericks AND leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44). So the claim isn't supported by any data from the table. That would make the answer FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires a specific combination of the visitor being Mavericks and Manu Gin\u00f3bili scoring 44 points as the leading scorer on February 28, 2008. However, upon reviewing the table, no such row exists where all these conditions are met simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
