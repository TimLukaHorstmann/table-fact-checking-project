    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a basketball game is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim in question is: \"In the May 2 game, the high point for the Toronto Raptor be Dell Curry (17) and high rebound be Antonio Davis (12).\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is stating. It mentions a specific game date\u2014May 2\u2014and specifies two key statistics from that game: the high points and high rebounds. The claim attributes both these stats to specific players: Dell Curry for points and Antonio Davis for rebounds.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice it's structured with several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, etc. Each row represents a different game. So, the first thing is to locate the May 2 game in the table.\n\nScanning through the dates column:\n\n1. April 21\n2. April 24\n3. April 27\n4. April 29\n5. May 2\n\nSo, the fifth row (index 4) corresponds to May 2. Now, I need to check the relevant columns for this row.\n\nThe claim is about two specific stats: high points and high rebounds. In the table, these are columns named \"high points\" and \"high rebounds.\" So, for the May 2 game, I should look at these two columns.\n\nLooking at row 5 (May 2), under \"high points,\" it says \"dell curry (17).\" That matches the first part of the claim. Now, checking the \"high rebounds\" column, it's mentioned as \"antonio davis (12).\" However, in the table, under \"high rebounds\" for this row, I see \"antonio davis (14).\" Wait, that doesn't match the 12 figure.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The fifth row: high rebounds are \"antonio davis (14),\" not 12 as the claim states. That's a discrepancy. So, the high rebounds number in the table is different from what the claim says.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table, in game 5 on May 2, under \"high rebounds,\" it's indeed antonio davis with 14, not 12. So, the claim is incorrect here. Therefore, the part about the high rebounds being 12 and attributed to Antonio Davis isn't accurate.\n\nHowever, the points part of the claim is correct\u2014Dell Curry scored 17 points. But since one part of the claim is wrong, does that make the entire claim FALSE?\n\nYes, because the claim makes two specific statements. If either of them is incorrect, the overall claim is not fully supported. So, even though one fact is right and the other is wrong, the presence of an error means the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nAdditionally, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant to verify this claim. The relevant cells would be the row for May 2 (row index 4) and the two columns: \"high points\" and \"high rebounds.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the high rebounds for the May 2 game are 14, not 12.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"Chris Child have the high in assist 2 time with 14 and 10 and share the high in assist 1 time with Alvin Williams with 6.\" I need to check each part of this claim against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's a list of games with details like date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. The relevant columns here are \"high points,\" \"high rebounds,\" and \"high assists.\" \n\nNext, I need to identify which rows (games) might be related to Chris Child's performance. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: April 21, Antonio Davis has high points and rebounds.\n- Row 2: April 24, Chris Childs has high points but not assists. His rebounds are shared with Antonio Davis.\n- Row 3: April 27, Antonio Davis has high points and rebounds. Chris Childs is mentioned as a player in the assists line but not as a high assist.\nWait, the high assists for this game are Chris Childs with 10. So row 3 shows Chris Childs leading in assists once with 10.\n\n- Row 4: April 29, Morris Peterson has high points, and Keon Clark is the highest rebounder. Alvin Williams leads in assists but not Chris Childs.\n- Row 5: May 2, Dell Curry scores 17, Antonio Davis has rebounds, and in assists, it's a tie between Chris Childs and Alvin Williams with 6 each.\n\nNow, analyzing the claim:\n1. \"Chris Child have the high in assist 2 time\" \u2013 looking for games where Chris Childs had the highest assists.\n   - Row 2: April 24, Chris Childs has 14 rebounds but not assists. Wait, no, in row 2, he's second in rebounds to Antonio Davis, and his assists are 14, which is the same as his rebounds? Or is that a typo?\nWait, let me check again. The table for row 2: high points by Chris Childs (22), rebounds by Antonio Davis (14), and assists by Chris Childs (14). So in that game, Chris has both high rebounds and assists.\nBut the claim says Chris has high assist two times with 14 and 10. Wait, does it mean he's leading twice?\n\nWait, no. The first part of the claim is \"Chris Child have the high in assist 2 time with 14 and 10.\" So that would imply Chris led in assists twice: once with 14 and once with 10.\n\nLooking at row 2, he had 14 assists. In row 3, he had 10 assists as the highest. So that's two times where he led in assists: 14 and 10. That part seems correct.\n\nSecond part of the claim: \"share the high in assist 1 time with Alvin Williams with 6.\" So Chris and Alvin both had 6 assists in one game, which should be row 5.\n\nIn row 5, the assists column shows \"chris childs , alvin williams (6)\". Yes, that's a tie for highest assists at 6. So they share the high once with 6.\n\nSo the claim seems to check out: Chris led in assists twice with 14 and 10, and shared it once with Alvin at 6. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first understand what the claim says.\n\nThe claim is: \"the team be detroit for every game play and the location be the palace of auburns hill or air canada centre.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, team, score, etc. The claim has two main parts. First, that for every game played, the team is Detroit. Second, that the location alternates between the Palace of Auburn Hills and Air Canada Centre.\n\nLet me check each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the team part. I'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. Game 1: Team is Detroit.\n2. Game 2: Team is Detroit.\n3. Game 3: Team is Detroit.\n4. Game 4: Team is Detroit.\n5. Game 5: Team is Detroit.\n\nSo, all games are played by Detroit, which means the first part of the claim is TRUE for each game.\n\nNow, checking the location. The claim says the location alternates between two venues: Palace of Auburn Hills and Air Canada Centre.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 1 and Game 2 are both at the Palace of Auburn Hills (attendance 22076 and 22076).\n- Game 3 is at Air Canada Centre.\n- Game 4 is also at Air Canada Centre but with a lower attendance.\n- Game 5 is back at Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nWait, that's not strictly alternating. Games 1 and 2 are same location; then 3 and 4 same; then 5 same as 1. So it's not strictly alternating between the two venues every game. Therefore, the second part of the claim might be FALSE because it doesn't alternate for every game.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the location be the palace of auburns hill or air canada centre.\" It doesn't specify that they must alternate. So as long as the location is one of those two, regardless of alternation, maybe it's still TRUE.\n\nSo the first part (team) is always Detroit for every game, which is TRUE. The second part says locations are either Palace or Air Canada, which is also TRUE because all games are in either of those two places.\n\nWait, but does the claim require that they alternate? It just says \"or,\" so it might be that each game's location is either one or the other, not necessarily alternating every time. So even though some games have the same venue consecutively, as long as it's one of the two, the claim holds.\n\nSo overall, both parts are TRUE, making the entire claim TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the locations:\n\n- Games 1 and 2: Palace\n- Game 3: Air Canada\n- Game 4: Air Canada\n- Game 5: Palace\n\nSo it's not strictly alternating every game; some consecutive games have the same location. So does that violate the claim? The claim says \"the location be the palace of auburns hill or air canada centre.\" It doesn't specify alternation, just that each game is in one of those two places.\n\nTherefore, the second part is also TRUE because all locations are indeed either Palace or Air Canada. So the entire claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. The claim says \"the location be...\" which might imply that it's either one or the other for each game. Since in every game, the location is indeed one of those two, regardless of whether they alternate or not, the second part holds.\n\nSo both parts are satisfied, making the entire claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe team is Detroit in all games, and all locations are either the Palace of Auburn Hills or Air Canada Centre. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"in the april 29 game against detroit with score w 89 - 83 the location and attendance be air canada centre 20112\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components. The game in question is on April 29th against Detroit, with a score of 89-83 (win). The claim specifies that the location and attendance for this game were at Air Canada Centre with 20,112 attendees.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a specific game with various attributes like date, team, score, etc. I need to find the exact row corresponding to April 29th against Detroit with a win score of 89-83.\n\nI'll start by examining the 'date' column for April 29. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. Row 1: April 21\n2. Row 2: April 24\n3. Row 3: April 27\n4. Row 4: April 29 \u2013 This is the game we're interested in.\n5. Row 5: May 2\n\nSo, row index 4 is April 29. Now, checking the 'game' column for this row: It's against Detroit, and the score is a win with 89-83 in overtime.\n\nNext, I'll verify the location and attendance. According to the table, on April 29, the location is \"air canada centre\" and the attendance is 20,112.\n\nNow, comparing these details to the claim: The claim states the location is Air Canada Centre with 20,112 attendees.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification. The claim says, \"there be 5 game list during the month of apr.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like game number, date, team, score, etc., but the important part here is the 'date' column since it's about the month of April.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Game 1: April 21\n2. Game 2: April 24\n3. Game 3: April 27\n4. Game 4: April 29\n5. Game 5: May 2\n\nSo, Game 5 is on May 2nd, which is outside the month of April. The claim mentions \"during the month of apr,\" so I need to check if all five games fall within April.\n\nSince Game 5 is in May, that means there are only four games listed in April (Games 1-4). Therefore, the claim that there are five game lists during April isn't true because one game is on May 2nd.\n\nNext, to find relevant cells, I should check each game's date. The first four games have dates in April, so their 'date' column is relevant for verifying the number of games in April. Game 5's date is May 2, which isn't part of April, so it's not relevant here.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row indices 0,1,2,3 (since those correspond to April dates). Each of these has a 'date' column that needs to be checked.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if there are five games during April, we need to check all game dates. Four games fall in April, so the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look at the 'game' and 'date' columns for each row to count April games.\n2. **Analyze Dates:** Only Games 1-4 are on April dates (21,24,27,29), Game 5 is May 2.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since only four games are in April, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nThese cells confirm the number of games in April by showing their relevant dates.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"dell curry lead the raptor in both point and rebound on may 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. Each row corresponds to a specific game.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that can verify this claim. So, the key elements are Dell Curry leading in both points and rebounds on May 2.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for the date May 2. Scanning through the rows, I see that row 5 is on May 2. That's our starting point.\n\nNext, let's check the high points column for that game. In row 5, under high points, it says \"dell curry (17)\". So Dell Curry scored 17 points, which seems to be the highest in that game.\n\nNow, checking the high rebounds column. The value here is \"antonio davis (12).\" That means Antonio Davis had 12 rebounds, which would make him the leader in rebounds for that game, not Dell Curry as per the claim.\n\nSince the claim states that Dell Curry led in both points and rebounds, but the table shows he only led in points, the claim is false. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: \n\n- The row number for May 2 is 5.\n- We need the columns 'high points' and 'high rebounds' because these are the metrics Dell Curry supposedly led.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because while Dell Curry did lead in points, he didn't lead in rebounds.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list out the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"Chris Child collect double digit assist in 3 of the 5 game.\" So, I need to check each game and see if Chris Child has at least 10 assists in three different games from the five listed.\n\nFirst, I should go through each row (each game) one by one and look at the 'high assists' column. Let me note down the 'high assists' for each game:\n\n1. Game 1: April 21 - Antonio Davis has 14 assists.\n2. Game 2: April 24 - Chris Childs has 14 assists.\n3. Game 3: April 27 - Chris Childs has 10 assists.\n4. Game 4: April 29 - Alvin Williams has 9 assists.\n5. Game 5: May 2 - Chris Childs and Alvin Williams have 6 assists together.\n\nNow, looking at each game:\n\n- **Game 1**: Antonio Davis had 14 assists. So Chris Child didn't assist here.\n- **Game 2**: Chris Childs had 14, which is a double-digit number (10+).\n- **Game 3**: Chris Childs had 10, exactly double digits.\n- **Game 4**: Alvin Williams had 9, but since it's only one player, does that count? The claim specifies \"Chris Child collect,\" so this isn't relevant unless there are multiple people with high assists. In Game 5, both Chris and Alvin have 6 each, but the column is 'high rebounds,' not assists. Wait, no, looking back: the 'high rebounds' and 'high points' columns might sometimes be split between players, so I need to check each game's 'high assists' column.\n\nWait, in Game 5, it says \"chris childs , alvin williams (6)\". So both had 6. Does that count as a double-digit assist? No, because individually they have 6, which is single-digit. So the 'high assists' for each game is just one number per game.\n\nSo, revisiting:\n\n- Game 1: Antonio - 14\n- Game 2: Chris Childs - 14\n- Game 3: Chris Childs -10\n- Game 4: Alvin -9\n- Game5: Both have 6, but the 'high assists' is 6, so only one player with 6.\n\nWait, actually, in Game 5, it says \"chris childs , alvin williams (6)\". So maybe both contributed to the same assist number? But for the purpose of this claim, we're looking at high assists per game. So each game's 'high assists' column indicates the highest number of assists by any player in that game.\n\nSo Game 5: highest is 6, so it's a single-digit. Therefore, Chris Child only has double-digit (10+) in Games 2 and 3. That's two games where he had double-digit assists.\n\nBut the claim says \"in 3 of the 5 games.\" So according to this, only two games meet the criteria. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting Game 5. If both Chris and Alvin have 6, does that mean the total team assists were 12? Or is the high assist per game 6? Because in some tables, 'high rebounds' might be a single number, the highest by any player.\n\nIn the table, each row's 'high rebounds' and 'high assists' seems to list a single number. So for Game5, it says \"chris childs , alvin williams (6)\". So perhaps both had 6, making the high assist per game as 6. Therefore, Chris Child only gets double-digit in two games.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Chris Child has double-digit assists in three of five games is false because he only did so in two games.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Chris Child collecting double-digit assists in three out of five games is true or false, we analyze each game's 'high assists' column:\n\n1. **Game 1**: Antonio Davis had 14 assists. Chris Child wasn't credited with a high assist here.\n2. **Game 2**: Chris Childs had 14 assists, which is double-digit.\n3. **Game 3**: Chris Childs had 10 assists, also double-digit.\n4. **Game 4**: Alvin Williams had 9 assists, not Chris Child.\n5. **Game 5**: Both Chris Child and Alvin Williams had 6 assists each, but this doesn't count as double-digit for either.\n\nChris Child has double-digit assists in only two games (Games 2 and 3), not three. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"4 of the 5 game list be against detroit at the palace of auburn hill.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. At least four games out of five are against Detroit.\n2. These games are played at \"the palace of auburn hill.\"\n\nSo, I need to verify both conditions for the relevant rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nEach row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nRelevant columns here are:\n- Team: To check if it's against Detroit.\n- Location: To check where the games were played.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one.\n\nGame 1: April 21 vs. Detroit at \"the palace of auburn hills.\" So yes, team is Detroit and location matches.\n\nGame 2: April 24 vs. Detroit at the same location. So another game in Detroit at that venue.\n\nGame 3: April 27 vs. Detroit at \"air canada centre.\" This is different from the palace, so this game isn't at the palace.\n\nGame 4: April 29 vs. Detroit at \"air canada centre\" again. Same location as game 3, not the palace.\n\nGame 5: May 2 vs. Detroit at \"the palace of auburn hills.\" So back to the palace.\n\nNow, let's count how many games are against Detroit and at the palace.\n\nGame 1: Detroit - palace \u2714\ufe0f\nGame 2: Detroit - palace \u2714\ufe0f\nGame 3: Detroit - not palace \u274c\nGame 4: Detroit - not palace \u274c\nGame 5: Detroit - palace \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, out of five games, four are against Detroit at the palace. Wait, let me count again:\n\n- Games 1,2,5 are against Detroit and at palace.\n- Games 3,4 are against Detroit but not at palace.\n\nThat's three games meeting both criteria, right? Wait, no: actually, the claim says \"4 of the 5 game list be against detroit at the palace of auburn hill.\"\n\nWait, let me count correctly. The claim is about four games being against Detroit and at the palace. So:\n\nGame 1: Yes\nGame 2: Yes\nGame 3: No (location different)\nGame 4: No (location different)\nGame 5: Yes\n\nSo that's three games, not four, that are both against Detroit and at the palace.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because according to the table:\n\n- Game 1: Detroit, palace\n- Game 2: Detroit, palace\n- Game 3: Detroit, different location\n- Game 4: Detroit, different location\n- Game 5: Detroit, palace\n\nSo Games 1,2,5 are at palace. That's three games.\n\nWait, but the claim says four of five games meet both conditions. So according to the table, only three do.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list them again:\n\nGame 1: Yes (D, palace)\nGame 2: Yes (D, palace)\nGame 3: No (D, not palace)\nGame 4: No (D, not palace)\nGame 5: Yes (D, palace)\n\nThat's three games where both conditions are met.\n\nSo the claim says four out of five, but according to the table, it's only three. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I'm interpreting correctly. The claim is \"4 of the 5 game list be against detroit at the palace of auburn hill.\" So does that mean exactly four games are both against Detroit and at that location? Because in the table, three games meet both criteria.\n\nTherefore, since the number is less than four, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that four out of five games are against Detroit at the palace. However, upon reviewing the table, only three games (games 1, 2, and 5) meet both conditions: being against Detroit and played at the palace. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the april 29 game be the highest attend at the air canada centre",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the april 29 game be the highest attend at the air canada centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It says that the April 29 game had the highest attendance at Air Canada Centre. So, to verify this, I need to look for two things: the date of the game in question and its attendance compared to other games played at Air Canada Centre.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details. The relevant columns here are \"date\" and \"location attendance.\" Specifically, for the April 29 game (row 4), I need to check the attendance number and then compare it against all other games that were played at Air Canada Centre.\n\nIn the table, there are two games at Air Canada Centre:\n- Game 3 on April 27\n- Game 4 on April 29\n\nFrom the \"location attendance\" column, Game 3 had an attendance of 20138 and Game 4 had an attendance of 20112. So, Game 3 has a higher attendance than Game 4.\n\nNow, checking if any other games at Air Canada Centre have higher attendances than Game 4's 20112 would require looking through all the rows, but only those with \"location\" as Air Canada Centre are relevant here. From the table, only Games 3 and 4 are at Air Canada Centre.\n\nTherefore, since Game 3 had a higher attendance of 20138, which is more than Game 4's 20112, the claim that April 29 was the highest attend at Air Canada Centre is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are the \"date\" and \"location attendance\" columns. Comparing the attendance numbers shows that Game 3 on April 27 had a higher attendance than Game 4 on April 29.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
