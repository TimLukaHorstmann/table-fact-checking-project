    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each column in the table and see which ones are relevant for verifying the claim. The columns are: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), location.\n\nThe claim mentions \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz.\" So the key elements here are:\n\n- Branding: \"yes! fm\"\n- Frequency: 101.1 MHz\n\nSo I need to check if there's a station in the table that has both these attributes. \n\nLooking at the first row of the table, it says:\n\n| yes! fm 101.1                | dwys       | 101.1 mhz   | 25 kw        | metro manila   |\n\nThis row matches both the branding \"yes! fm\" and the frequency \"101.1 mhz.\" The other columns aren't directly relevant to verify these two points, but they do support that this station exists.\n\nNow, I should consider if there are any other rows with the same branding or frequency that might affect the claim. However, the claim specifies \"at 101.1 mhz,\" which is unique to the first row. The other frequencies like 104.1, 91.1, etc., don't match.\n\nSo each part of the claim is satisfied by this row. Therefore, since there's a station in the table that matches both the branding and frequency mentioned, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points. The relevant cells would be the ones for branding and frequency, which are columns 0 and 2 respectively.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the first row of the table, which matches both the \"branding\" and \"frequency\" criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro be the branding for the call sign dxyr.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided to see if there's a matching entry that supports this claim. The table has several columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find any relevant information.\n\nRow 0:\n- Branding: yes! fm 101.1\n- Callsign: dwys\n- Frequency: 101.1 mhz\n- Power: 25 kw\n- Location: metro manila\n\nThis doesn't match the claim because the branding is different, and the callsign is dwys.\n\nRow 1:\n- Branding: yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\n- Callsign: dzvm\n- Frequency: 104.1 mhz\n- Power: 1 kw\n- Location: urdaneta\n\nAgain, this doesn't match because the branding name and callsign are different from the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Branding: yes! fm 91.1 boracay\n- Callsign: dyyr\n- Frequency: 91.1 mhz\n- Power: 1 kw\n- Location: boracay\n\nThis is close, but the branding here is yes! fm 91.1, not 104.7, and the callsign is dyyr, which matches the call sign in the claim, but the branding doesn't.\n\nRow 3:\n- Branding: yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\n- Callsign: dyyd\n- Frequency: 106.3 mhz\n- Power: 10 kw\n- Location: dumaguete\n\nThis row's branding and callsign don't match the claim either.\n\nRow 4:\n- Branding: yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\n- Callsign: dxyr\n- Frequency: 104.7 mhz\n- Power: 10 kw\n- Location: cagayan de oro\n\nThis row matches exactly with the claim. The branding is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" and the callsign is dxyr.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure there are no other rows that might also have a matching call sign or branding that could affect the result. Let me review each row again quickly.\n\nNo, only row 4 matches both the branding and the callsign from the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because all the information in the claim can be found in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 4 of the table where \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" is listed as the branding and \"dxyr\" as the callsign.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"callsign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"1 kw be the power for yes! fm 91.1 boracay\". \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of this statement and see what it refers to in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\". So, I need to find that exact entry in the table. Looking at the 'branding' column, the third row is \"yes! fm 91.1\", and the location is boracay. So that's our relevant row: row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed).\n\nNext, the claim talks about the power being 1 kw. In the table, each row has a 'power (kw)' column. For this specific row (row 2), what does the power say? Scanning through, I see that for \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\", the power is listed as 1 kw.\n\nSo now, comparing both parts: The brand and location match in the table, and the power is indeed 1 kw. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the power for \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" is 1 kw. Checking the table:\n\n- Row index 2 has \"yes! fm 91.1\" in the branding column and boracay in location.\n- The 'power (kw)' for this row is 1.\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"power (kw)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the frequency for callsign dxyr be from brand yes! fm 101.1\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main parts: it's talking about a specific callsign \"dxyr\" and a specific frequency. It also mentions that this frequency comes from the brand \"yes! fm 101.1\".\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different radio station with details like branding, callsign, frequency, power, and location. So my task is to find the row where the callsign is \"dxyr\" and check whether its frequency matches what's stated in the claim, which is 101.1 MHz from the brand \"yes! fm 101.1\".\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Callsign is dwys. Branding is yes! fm 101.1. So not relevant for dxyr.\nRow 1: Callsign is dzvm. Branding is yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Callsign is dyyr. Branding is yes! fm 91.1 boracay. So this is a station with callsign dyyr, but the frequency here is 91.1 MHz, which doesn't match the claim's 101.1.\nRow 3: Callsign is dyyd. Branding is yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete. Not relevant for dxyr.\nRow 4: Callsign is dxyr. Branding is yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro. So the callsign matches, but the frequency here is 104.7 MHz, not 101.1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The claim says that \"dxyr\" has a frequency of 101.1 from \"yes! fm 101.1\", but looking at the table, there's no row with callsign dxyr and branding yes! fm 101.1. Instead, the only station under dxyr is for 104.7 MHz.\n\nSo the claim must be checking if dxyr has a frequency of 101.1 from yes! fm 101.1, but according to the table, that's not correct. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row for callsign dxyr. Yes, only row 4: dxyr with frequency 104.7 MHz and branding yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro. There's no entry in the table where dxyr is associated with yes! fm 101.1 or 101.1 MHz.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the callsign dxyr doesn't have a frequency of 101.1 MHz from that brand in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the callsign \"dxyr\" has a frequency of 101.1 MHz from the brand \"yes! fm 101.1.\" However, upon reviewing the table, I see that \"dxyr\" is associated with 104.7 MHz under \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro,\" not 101.1 MHz or the \"yes! fm 101.1\" brand.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look for rows where the callsign is \"dxyr\" and the branding matches \"yes! fm 101.1.\"\n\n2. **Review Each Row:**\n   - Only row 4 has \"dxyr,\" with a frequency of 104.7 MHz.\n   \n3. **Conclusion:** No data in the table supports the claim about \"dxyr\" having the specified frequency from that brand.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is FALSE, as there's no matching data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"dyyr be the call sign for yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the callsign 'dyyr' and the station details of \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\" So I need to check both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 0: branding is \"yes! fm 101.1\", callsign is dwys, frequency 101.1 mhz, power 25 kw, location metro manila.\nRow 1: branding yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta, callsign dzvm, freq 104.1, power 1 kw, loc urdaneta.\nRow 2: branding yes! fm 91.1 boracay, call dyyr, freq 91.1, power 1, boracay.\nRow 3: branding yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete, call dyyd, freq 106.3, 10 kw, dumaguete.\nRow 4: branding yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro, call dxyr, freq 104.7, 10 kw, cagayan de oro.\n\nSo the claim says that 'dyyr' is the callsign for \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\"\n\nLooking at row 4: branding is yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro and callsign is dxyr. So the callsign isn't dyrr but dxyr.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the call sign doesn't match. Also, I need to check if there's another station with dyrr as the callsign. Looking through all rows:\n\n- dwys, dzvm, dyyr, dyyd, dxyr. So only row 2 has dyyr, which is for boracay, not cagayan de oro.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 4 (callsign) and row 2 (call sign's location). Wait, but the claim mentions both call sign and station name, so I need to check if the station in row 4 has call sign dyrr. It doesn't; it has dxyr. So the only relevant cell is row 4, column callsign because that's where the discrepancy is.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should also check if \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" exists in the table. Yes, it's in row 4. But the callsign there is dxyr, not dyrr as claimed. So only row 4's callsign column is relevant because that's where the mismatch occurs.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include row 4 and maybe row 2 if needed, but since the claim refers to a specific station, the key discrepancy is in row 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 'dyyr' is the call sign for \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\" However, checking the table, this station (row 4) has the call sign 'dxyr,' not 'dyyr.'

Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and check it against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"dyyd be the callsign for the branding yes! fm 91.1 boracay with a power of 1 kw.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions three things:\n1. The callsign is dyyd.\n2. The branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\"\n3. The power is 1 kw.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a markdown format with several columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location. Each row represents a different station.\n\nI'll look for the specific branding \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\" Scanning through the 'branding' column:\n- Row 0: yes! fm 101.1\n- Row 1: yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\n- Row 2: yes! fm 91.1 boracay (This matches the branding in the claim)\n- Rows 3 and 4 are different.\n\nSo, the specific branding \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" is found in row 2.\n\nNext, I check the callsign for this branding. In row 2, under 'callsign', it's dydd? Wait, no, looking again: row 2 has a callsign of dyyr. Wait, let me make sure. No, wait, the table shows:\n\nRow 0:\n- callsign: dwys\n\nRow 1:\n- callsign: dzvm\n\nRow 2:\n- callsign: dyyr\nWait, no\u2014wait, in row 2, the 'branding' is yes! fm 91.1 boracay, and the 'callsign' is dyyr?

Let me check another row with 'dyyd' as the callsign. Looking at row 3: yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete has callsign dyyd.\n\nSo, in the claim, it's stating that \"dyyd\" is the callsign for the specific branding \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\" But according to the table, the callsign for that branding is actually dyyr, not dyyd. Therefore, there seems to be a discrepancy.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: yes! fm 101.1 \u2192 dwys\n\nRow 1: yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta \u2192 dzvm\n\nRow 2: yes! fm 91.1 boracay \u2192 dyyr\n\nRow 3: yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete \u2192 dyyd\n\nRow 4: yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro \u2192 dxyr\n\nSo, the callsign for \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" is indeed dyyr, not dyyd.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the callsign is dyyd is incorrect; it's actually dyyr.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again:\n\nThe table shows:\n\nRow 2: yes! fm 91.1 boracay | dyyr\n\nSo, for that specific branding, the callsign is dyyr, not dyyd. So the claim is wrong on that count.\n\nAdditionally, let's look at the power (kw). The claim says \"with a power of 1 kw.\" Looking at row 2, under 'power (kw)', it's 1 kw. That matches. So the power part is correct.\n\nSo summarizing: the branding in the claim exists in the table as \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" with callsign dyyr and power 1 kw. The claim says the callsign is dyyd, which doesn't match; instead, it's dyyr.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the callsign is wrong.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"dyyd\" is the callsign for a specific radio station branding. However, upon checking the table, the correct callsign for \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" is \"dyyr,\" not \"dyyd.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Branding**: The claim refers to \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\" This exact branding exists in row 2 of the table.\n   \n2. **Check Callsign**: For this branding (row 2), the callsign is listed as \"dyyr,\" not \"dyyd.\"\n   \n3. **Verify Power**: The power for this station is indeed 1 kw, which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the callsign does not match, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"callsign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power (kw)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
