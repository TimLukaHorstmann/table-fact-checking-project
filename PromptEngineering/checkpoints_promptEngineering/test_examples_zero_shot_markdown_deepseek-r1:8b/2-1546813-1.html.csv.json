    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the Solheim Cup being hosted in the US on seven occasions from 1990 through 2013 is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that the Solheim Cup was hosted in the US seven times between 1990 and 2013. So I need to check each year in this range (1990-2013) and see how many times the venue is in the US, specifically if the USA team won those matches.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various years, venues, winning teams, scores, and captains from both the US and Europe. The relevant columns for our check are \"year,\" \"venue,\" \"winning team,\" and perhaps others, but mainly these two.\n\nThe first step is to identify all rows where the year is between 1990 and 2013 inclusive. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. 2013: Venue in Colorado, USA. Winning team is Europe.\n2. 2011: Ireland. Europe won.\n3. 2009: Illinois, USA. US won.\n4. 2007: Sweden. US won.\n5. 2005: Indiana, USA. US won.\n6. 2003: Sweden. Europe won.\n7. 2002: Minnesota, USA. US won.\n8. 2000: Scotland. Europe won.\n9. 1998: Ohio, USA. US won.\n10. 1996: Wales. US won.\n11. 1994: West Virginia, USA. US won.\n12. 1992: Scotland. Europe won.\n13. 1990: Florida, USA. US won.\n\nWait, but the claim is about hosting in the US on seven occasions. So I need to count how many times the venue was in the US and whether that happened seven times between these years.\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n- 2013: US (colorado)\n- 2011: Ireland\n- 2009: US\n- 2007: Sweden\n- 2005: US\n- 2003: Sweden\n- 2002: US\n- 2000: Scotland\n- 1998: US\n- 1996: Wales\n- 1994: US\n- 1992: Scotland\n- 1990: US\n\nNow, count the number of times venue is in USA:\n\n2013: Yes (1)\n2009: Yes (2)\n2005: Yes (3)\n2002: Yes (4)\n1998: Yes (5)\n1994: Yes (6)\n1990: Yes (7)\n\nSo that's seven times. But wait, the claim says \"hosted in the US on 7 occasions.\" So does hosting mean both teams playing there or just the venue being there? Since the Solheim Cup is a competition between Europe and the USA, I think the host refers to where it's held each time. So the venues listed for the US are indeed seven.\n\nHowever, another angle: sometimes the same course might host multiple times, but in this table, each year has a different venue, so no duplication here. Each of those seven years had the Solheim Cup hosted in the USA.\n\nWait, but let me check if all these were actually conducted as Solheim Cups. I assume that yes, since the table seems to list them. So from 1990 to 2013, there are seven US-hosted events.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because it's hosted seven times in the US during those years.\n\nBut wait, another point: sometimes the same venue might be listed multiple times, but in this case, each year has a unique venue. Also, I need to ensure that each of these was indeed an occurrence of the Solheim Cup, which seems to be the case here.\n\nSo yes, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that from 1990 through 2013, there were seven instances where the Solheim Cup was hosted in the US. Each of these years had a venue in the USA, and the United States team won each of those matches. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"the united state team win 8 of the solheim cup start in 1990 and the last be in 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific years: 1990 and 2009. The team is referred to as the \"united state team,\" which in the table is listed as \"united states.\" The claim says they won 8 times starting from 1990, with the last win being in 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check for entries in the years 1990 and 2009 where the winning team was the United States. From the table provided, each row has a 'year', 'venue', 'winning team', 'score', 'usa captain', and 'europe captain'.\n\nStarting with 1990: I'll look through the table for rows where the year is 1990. Scanning down, I see that in 1990, the venue was Lake Nona Golf & Country Club in Florida, USA. The winning team was the United States, with a score of 11\u00bd - 4\u00bd. The captains were Kathy Whitworth and Mickey Walker.\n\nNext, checking for the last win in 2009: In 2009, the venue was Rich Harvest Farms in Illinois, USA. The winning team is again listed as United States with a score of 16 - 12. The captains were Beth Daniel and Alison Nicholas.\n\nNow, I need to see if there are exactly 8 wins by the United States from 1990 through 2009 inclusive. Let's list out all the years where the US won:\n\n- 1990: Yes\n- 1992: No (Europe won)\n- 1994: Yes\n- 1996: Yes\n- 1998: Yes\n- 2000: Europe won\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2003: Europe won\n- 2007: Yes\n- 2009: Yes\n\nWait, that's more than 8. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table, the US wins are in 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2007, and 2009. That's seven years where the US won.\n\nBut the claim says they won 8 times starting from 1990 and last in 2009. So there's a discrepancy here\u2014only seven wins from 1990 to 2009.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all these years are within the range from 1990 to 2009. They are: 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2007, and 2009. That's seven instances, not eight.\n\nMoreover, in 1992 and 2003, Europe won, so those aren't relevant for the US team wins. Therefore, the claim that they won 8 times starting from 1990 is incorrect; it's actually seven times.\n\nSo the claim is false because there are only seven victories by the United States from 1990 through 2009, not eight. Additionally, all these relevant cells need to be identified for each year where the US won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the United States team won only 7 matches between 1990 and 2009, not 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth be all captains that win the cup 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's stating that these three individuals have each won the cup twice as team captains. So my task is to check if each of them has a two-time victory in their respective years.\n\nLooking at the table, which lists various golf tournaments over the years from 1990 to 2013, I see several rows where Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth are listed as captains. \n\nStarting with Patty Sheehan: I need to find how many times she won the cup. Scanning through the table, I see her name in 2002, 1998, 1996, and 1994. Wait, that's four times, but each time it's only a single win per year. So Patty Sheehan has multiple wins, but does she have two wins? Yes, for sure. For example, in 2002 and 1998, she was the captain when her team won.\n\nNext, Judy Rankin: I'll look through the table to see how many times she was a captain and won. Her name appears in 1998, 1996, and 1994. So again, that's three victories. But the claim is about winning twice, so yes, she has multiple wins as well.\n\nNow, Kathy Whitworth: Checking her entries, she appears in 1990 and 1992. Wait, in 1990, it says \"kathy whitworth\" was the captain of the USA team that won with a score of 11\u00bd - 4\u00bd. And in 1992, she's listed again as the captain when they won 11\u00bd - 6\u00bd. So that's two wins. \n\nWait a second, but I'm noticing something. The claim says \"all captains that win the cup 2 time.\" Does this mean each of them has exactly two wins, or at least two? If it's at least two, then Patty and Judy have more than two, which still makes the statement true because they have at least two wins each.\n\nBut I should double-check each person to ensure there are two instances where they were captains and their teams won. \n\nLooking again:\n\n- Patty Sheehan: 2002, 1998, 1996, 1994. So four times, which is more than two.\n- Judy Rankin: 1998, 1996, 1994. Three times, which is more than two.\n- Kathy Whitworth: 1990 and 1992. Exactly two times.\n\nSo all three have at least two wins as captains. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because each of them has won the cup twice or more.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the table doesn't show any of them winning only once. From my scan, Patty and Judy have multiple wins, and Kathy has exactly two. So the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2002, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1998, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1996, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1994, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1990, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1992, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the Solheim Cup being hosted outside of the United States six times between 1990 and 2013 is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully analyzing the provided table and the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the U.S. six times in the period from 1990 to 2013. So my task is to check how many times the venue was not in the United States during this timeframe.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, with details like the venue location, winning team, score, and captains from the USA and Europe. The \"venue\" column lists the host country or region for each year. \n\nI need to identify all rows where the venue is NOT in the United States because that indicates the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the U.S.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row from 1990 onwards:\n\n- 1990: Lake Nona Golf Club, Florida, USA \u2192 Hosted in the U.S. (Relevant for NOT)\n- 1992: Dalmahoy Country Club, Scotland \u2192 Hosted outside the U.S.\n- 1994: The Greenbrier, West Virginia, USA \u2192 Hosted in the U.S.\n- 1996: St Pierre Golf & Country Club, Wales \u2192 Hosted outside the U.S.\n- 1998: Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA \u2192 Hosted in the U.S.\n- 2000: Loch Lomond Golf Club, Scotland \u2192 Hosted outside the U.S.\n- 2002: Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota, USA \u2192 Hosted in the U.S.\n- 2003: Halmstad GK, Sweden \u2192 Hosted outside the U.S.\n- 2005: Crooked Stick Golf Club, Indiana, USA \u2192 Hosted in the U.S.\n- 2007: Halmstad GK, Sweden \u2192 Hosted outside the U.S.\n- 2009: Rich Harvest Farms, Illinois, USA \u2192 Hosted in the U.S.\n- 2011: Killeen Castle Golf Resort, Ireland \u2192 Hosted outside the U.S.\n- 2013: Colorado Golf Club, Colorado, USA \u2192 Hosted in the U.S.\n\nNow, let me count how many times it was hosted outside the U.S. between these years:\n\nFrom 1990 to 2013, the years when the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the U.S. are:\n- 1992\n- 1996\n- 2000\n- 2003\n- 2007\n- 2011\n\nThat's six times. So the claim is saying it happened six times between 1990 and 2013, which matches exactly.\n\nWait, but I should check each year in that range to ensure I didn't miss any. Let me list all the years from 1990 to 2013:\n\n1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013.\n\nLooking at each of these, the years when the venue is not in the U.S. are indeed six: 1992, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2007, and 2011.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it was hosted outside the U.S. six times between those years is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe Solheim Cup was hosted outside the United States six times during the period from 1990 to 2013, as verified by the table provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the highest score for a winning team be 18 and the lowest score be 11.5.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. The highest score by a winning team is 18.\n2. The lowest score is 11.5.\n\nI need to check each part against the table to see if they hold true.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column in the table, I'll list out all the scores:\n\n- 2013: 18 -10\n- 2011:15-13\n- 2009:16-12\n- 2007:16-12\n- 2005:15\u00bd -12\u00bd\n- 2003:17\u00bd -10\u00bd\n- 2002:15\u00bd -12\u00bd\n- 2000:14\u00bd -11\u00bd\n- 1998:16-12\n- 1996:17-11\n- 1994:13-7\n- 1992:11\u00bd -6\u00bd\n- 1990:11\u00bd -4\u00bd\n\nI'm focusing on the \"score\" column for both parts of the claim.\n\nStarting with the highest score being 18. Scanning through the table, the first row in 2013 has a score of 18-10. So that's the highest I can see here. There are no scores higher than 18. So this part seems correct.\n\nNow, for the lowest score being 11.5. Looking at all the scores, the lowest is 11\u00bd in 1992 and 11\u00bd in 1990. Both are 11.5. There's also a 6\u00bd in 1992, but that's not the lowest because the team with Europe had 6\u00bd, but since we're looking for the lowest score by a winning team, it's about the winning side. Wait, actually, the claim is about the lowest score overall? Or just for the winning team?\n\nWait, the claim says \"the highest score for a winning team be 18 and the lowest score be 11.5.\" So I think it refers to the scores of the winning teams. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 2013: Europe won with 18-10\n- 2011: Europe won with 15-13\n- 2009: USA with 16-12\n- 2007: USA with 16-12\n- 2005: USA with 15\u00bd -12\u00bd\n- 2003: Europe with 17\u00bd -10\u00bd\n- 2002: USA with 15\u00bd -12\u00bd\n- 2000: Europe with 14\u00bd -11\u00bd\n- 1998: USA with 16-12\n- 1996: USA with 17-11\n- 1994: USA with 13-7\n- 1992: Europe with 11\u00bd -6\u00bd\n- 1990: USA with 11\u00bd -4\u00bd\n\nSo the winning teams have scores ranging from as low as 11\u00bd (in 1992 and 1990) up to 18. So the lowest score among all winning teams is indeed 11\u00bd, achieved by both the USA in 1990 and Europe in 1992.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we verify each part:\n\n1. **Highest Score**: The highest score for a winning team is 18 (2013).\n2. **Lowest Score**: The lowest score for a winning team is 11\u00bd (1990 and 1992).\n\nBoth conditions are met in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

I'll look through each row for the year 2009. Scanning down, yes, in 2009, the venue was rich harvest farms in Illinois, and the winning team is listed as 'united states'. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the second part: Is this the US's 7th title since 1990? I need to check all years from 1990 onwards and count how many times the US won. Let me go through each relevant row:\n\n- 1990: US won.\n- 1992: Europe won.\n- 1994: US won.\n- 1996: US won.\n- 1998: US won.\n- 2000: Europe won.\n- 2002: US won.\n- 2003: Europe won.\n- 2005: US won.\n- 2007: US won.\n- 2009: US won.\n\nCounting the US victories from 1990 onward:\n1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2009. That's 8 wins, not 7. Hmm, that's a problem because the claim says it's their 7th title since 1990.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list them again:\n\n1. 1990\n2. 1994\n3. 1996\n4. 1998\n5. 2002\n6. 2005\n7. 2007\n8. 2009\n\nYes, that's eight wins. The claim says it's the 7th since 1990, so this is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if all these are considered \"titles\" in the context of the Solheim Cup. Since the Solheim Cup is an annual event, each year could represent a title win. So from 1990 to 2009, that's 20 years, but the US has won multiple times.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I should consider whether 2009 is indeed the last win by the US in the table. The table goes up to 2009, so yes, after that, the next rows are earlier years. So in the table provided, 2009 is the latest year where the US won.\n\nBut according to my count, that would be their 8th win since 1990, not 7. Therefore, the claim's second part is incorrect.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about how titles are counted. Maybe the first win in 1990 doesn't count as a \"title\" yet? But no, each year they win would be a title. Alternatively, maybe the term \"since 1990\" refers to starting from 1990, so the 2009 win is the 8th.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement that it's their 7th title since 1990 is false because it's actually the 8th.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any years. Let me list out all the US wins from 1990 onwards:\n\n- 1990: US\n- 1992: Europe\n- 1994: US\n- 1996: US\n- 1998: US\n- 2000: Europe\n- 2002: US\n- 2003: Europe\n- 2005: US\n- 2007: US\n- 2009: US\n\nThat's indeed eight wins, not seven. So the claim is incorrect on that point.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the count starts after a certain year? Or maybe there's a different way to interpret it. Alternatively, perhaps \"since 1990\" means including 1990 as the first win, making 2009 the eighth.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that 2009 was their seventh consecutive title starting from 1990, but I don't think that's the case because there are gaps where Europe won in between.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the US last won the Solheim Cup in 2009 and that it would be their 7th title since 1990. However, upon reviewing the table, the US has actually won eight times from 1990 onwards, including 2009. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the Solheim Cup being hosted outside the US on seven occasions from 1990 to 2013 is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the US on seven different occasions between 1990 and 2013. So, my job is to verify how many times the venue was in Europe during those years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a year from 2000 to 2013. Wait, actually, when I check the years listed in the table, they start from 2000 up to 2013. But the claim mentions the period from 1990 onwards. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because the earliest year in the table is 2000, but the claim starts in 1990.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The table includes years from 2000 to 2013, but the claim refers to 1990-2013. So, I might be missing data for some of those years. That could be a problem because if the relevant data isn't all in the table, it might affect the verification.\n\nNext, I need to look at each year from 1990 to 2013 and see where the Solheim Cup was held. The table doesn't have entries for every year, only specific ones. So, for the years not listed, I might need to infer based on available information or perhaps accept that the data is incomplete.\n\nLet's start by listing all the years from 1990 to 2013 and see which are covered in the table:\n\n- 1990: Yes (row 9)\n- 1991: No\n- 1992: Yes (row 10)\n- 1993: No\n- 1994: Yes (row 11)\n- 1995: No\n- 1996: Yes (row 12)\n- 1997: No\n- 1998: Yes (row 13)\n- 1999: No\n- 2000: Yes (row 14)\n- 2001: No\n- 2002: Yes (row 15)\n- 2003: Yes (row 16)\n- 2004: No\n- 2005: Yes (row 17)\n- 2006: No\n- 2007: Yes (row 18)\n- 2008: No\n- 2009: Yes (row 19)\n- 2010: No\n- 2011: Yes (row 20)\n- 2012: No\n- 2013: Yes (row 21)\n\nWait, the table has rows from 2000 to 2013, but each row is a specific year. So, for example, row 14 is 2000, row 15 is 2002, and so on. Wait no, looking back, the first row in the table is 2013 as the highest year listed. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, let's check the table again:\n\nThe table starts with year 2013 at the top and goes down to 1990 at the bottom. So each row is a specific year, but they are ordered from most recent to past. So, row 1: 2013, row 2: 2011, ..., row 13: 1998, etc., until row 13 (assuming 13 rows) being 1990.\n\nWait no, looking at the markdown table:\n\n|   year | venue ... |\n|-------:|:-----------|\n| 2013 ... |\n| 2011 ... |\n| 2009 ... |\n| 2007 ... |\n| 2005 ... |\n| 2002 ... |\n| 2000 ... |\n| 1998 ... |\n| 1996 ... |\n| 1994 ... |\n| 1992 ... |\n| 1990 ... |\n\nSo the years in the table are 2013, 2011, 2009, 2007, 2005, 2002, 2000, 1998, 1996, 1994, 1992, and 1990. So that's 12 rows.\n\nWait, but from 1990 to 2013, there are more years than that. The claim refers to the period 1990-2013, which is a span of 24 years (including both 1990 and 2013). However, the table only covers specific years within this range. So for each year in 1990-2013, I need to check if it's in the table.\n\nBut the problem is that many of these years are not covered in the table, so I might have to assume that outside the listed years, the Solheim Cup was either hosted in the US or not. But wait, the claim says \"hosted outside the US on 7 occasions.\" So, it's about the number of times it was held in Europe (which is outside the US) during those years.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The Solheim Cup is a golf competition between teams from Europe and the United States. The venue alternates between courses in Europe and the US. So, when the venue is in Europe, that counts as hosting outside the US.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that there were seven such occasions where the Solheim Cup was hosted in Europe (i.e., outside the US) from 1990 to 2013.\n\nGiven that, I need to count how many times between 1990 and 2013 the Solheim Cup was held in Europe. Each row in the table represents a year when the Solheim Cup took place, either in the US or Europe.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2013: venue in USA (row 1)\n- 2011: venue in USA (row 2)\n- 2009: venue in USA (row 3)\n- 2007: venue in USA (row 4)\n- 2005: venue in Europe (row 5)\n- 2002: venue in Europe (row 6)\n- 2000: venue in Europe (row 7)\n- 1998: venue in Europe (row 8)\n- 1996: venue in Europe (row 9)\n- 1994: venue in USA (row10)\n- 1992: venue in Europe (row11)\n- 1990: venue in Europe (row12)\n\nSo, from the table:\n\nYears where it was hosted in Europe (outside US): 2005, 2002, 2000, 1998, 1996, 1992, 1990. That's 7 times.\n\nBut wait, looking back at row 5: 2005 is Europe, yes. Row6: 2002 Europe, etc. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"from 1990 to 2013.\" But in our table, only those 7 years are when it was held in Europe during that time.\n\nBut wait, in 2013, it was hosted in USA, and in 2011 as well, etc. So between 1990-2013, the Solheim Cup was hosted in Europe seven times (1990,1992,1996,1998,2000,2002,2005) and in the US the other years.\n\nBut wait, let me check each row:\n\nRow1: 2013 - USA\nRow2: 2011 - USA\nRow3: 2009 - USA\nRow4: 2007 - USA\nRow5: 2005 - Europe\nRow6: 2002 - Europe\nRow7: 2000 - Europe\nRow8: 1998 - Europe\nRow9: 1996 - Europe\nRow10: 1994 - USA\nRow11: 1992 - Europe\nRow12: 1990 - Europe\n\nSo from 1990 to 2013, the years when it was in Europe are 1990,1992,1996,1998,2000,2002,2005. That's seven occasions.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there were seven such hosting is correct based on the table data.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the exact venue for each year:\n\nFrom external knowledge, I can recall that:\n\n- 2013: Congressional CC in US\n- 2011: St Andrews in Scotland (Europe)\nWait no, St Andrews is in Europe. Wait, but if it's held in Europe, then 2011 would be a European venue.\n\nBut according to the table above, 2011 was hosted in USA (row2). So maybe my external knowledge conflicts with the table data. Similarly for 2009: I think it was at Turnberry, which is in Scotland, so Europe.\n\nWait, this suggests that perhaps the table's data might be incorrect because if 2009 was held in Europe, then row3 would have venue as Europe, not USA. So perhaps my initial assumption based on the table is wrong.\n\nWait no, let me clarify: The user provided a table where each row has the year and venue, but without more context, I have to go by that.\n\nBut given that the user might have provided correct data, I'll proceed with what's in the table. So according to the table:\n\n- 2013: USA\n- 2011: USA\n- 2009: USA\n- 2007: USA\n- 2005: Europe\n- 2002: Europe\n- 2000: Europe\n- 1998: Europe\n- 1996: Europe\n- 1994: USA\n- 1992: Europe\n- 1990: Europe\n\nSo total of 7 European hosting occasions from 1990 to 2013.\n\nThus, the claim is correct based on this data.\n\nTherefore, the task is completed, and the answer is that yes, it was hosted seven times in Europe during that period.\n</think>\n\nThe Solheim Cup was indeed hosted outside the United States (in Europe) on seven occasions between 1990 and 2013. These occurrences were in 1990, 1992, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2005.\n\nAnswer: The Solheim Cup was hosted in Europe seven times during the period from 1990 to 2013.",

The claim states: \"Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth be all captains that win the Solheim Cup 1 time.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the table.\n\nStarting with Patty Sheehan. I'll scan through the \"usa captain\" and \"europe captain\" columns to find any entries where she is listed as a captain. Looking at each row:\n\n- 2013: usa captain is Meg Mallon, europe is Liselotte Neumann.\n- 2011: usa captain Rosie Jones, europe Alison Nicholas.\n- 2009: usa Beth Daniel, europe Alison Nicholas.\n- 2007: usa Betsy King, europe Helen Alfredsson.\n- 2005: usa Nancy Lopez, europe Catrin Nilsmark.\n- 2003: Patty Sheehan is listed under usa captain. So that's one win for Solheim Cup.\n\nNext, Judy Rankin. I'll check if she appears as a captain in any row:\n\nLooking through the years:\n\n- 1998: usa captain Judy Rankin.\n- 1996: usa Judy Rankin again.\n- 1994: usa Joanne Carner.\n- 1992: europe Mickey Walker.\n\nSo, Judy Rankin has won at least once as a captain in 1998 and 1996. So she's also a winner.\n\nLastly, Kathy Whitworth:\n\nChecking the table:\n\n- 1990: usa captain Kathy Whitworth.\n\nShe has one win. \n\nNow, the claim says all three are captains that \"win the Solheim Cup 1 time.\" From the table, Patty Sheehan won in 2003, Judy Rankin in 1996 and 1998, and Kathy Whitworth in 1990.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the solheim cup be host in the united state 6 time from 1990 - 2013\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The Solheim Cup is a golf tournament between teams from Europe and the United States. The claim is stating that the Solheim Cup was hosted in the United States six times within the years 1990 to 2013.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists the year, venue, winning team, score, USA captain, and Europe captain for various Solheim Cup events. Each row represents a different year, with details about that specific tournament.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check how many times the United States hosted the event within the specified period. So, I should go through each row from 1990 onwards and count the instances where the venue is in the USA and the winning team is the United States.\n\nLet me list out all the rows that fall between 1990 and 2013:\n\n- 1990: Lake Nona Golf & Country Club, Florida, USA. Winning team is the US.\n- 1992: Dalmahoy CC, Scotland. Europe won.\n- 1994: The Greenbrier, WV, USA. US won.\n- 1996: St Pierre GC, Wales. US won.\n- 1998: Muirfield Village, OH, USA. US won.\n- 2000: Loch Lomond GC, Scotland. Europe won.\n- 2002: Interlachen CC, MN, USA. US won.\n- 2003: Barseb\u00e4ck GC, Sweden. Europe won.\n- 2005: Crooked Stick GC, IN, USA. US won.\n- 2007: Halmstad GC, Sweden. US won.\n- 2009: Rich Harvest Farms, IL, USA. US won.\n- 2011: Killeen Castle, Ireland. Europe won.\n- 2013: Colorado GC, CO, USA. US won.\n\nNow, let's count the number of times the US hosted and won:\n\n1990: Hosted by USA, US team won \u2192 counts as one.\n1994: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 second.\n1996: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 third.\n1998: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 fourth.\n2002: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 fifth.\n2005: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 sixth.\n2007: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 seventh.\n2009: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 eighth.\n\nWait, that's eight times. But the claim says six times from 1990 to 2013. That seems off because I'm counting more than six. Let me recount:\n\nLooking again at the years and venues:\n\n1990: Yes\n1992: No (Scotland)\n1994: Yes\n1996: Yes\n1998: Yes\n2000: Europe won, so no.\n2002: Yes\n2003: Europe won, no.\n2005: Yes\n2007: Yes\n2009: Yes\n2011: Europe won, no.\n2013: Yes.\n\nSo that's 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013. That's a total of nine times the US hosted and won between 1990-2013. But wait, in 2011 and 2013, in 2013 the US did win, so that's included.\n\nBut according to my count, it's more than six times. However, I think the claim might be considering only when the USA was the host country, regardless of who won. Wait, no, because the claim mentions both the hosting and the winning team.\n\nWait, perhaps the table includes years beyond 2013? Let me check: the table goes up to 2013, so that's included. The claim is about six times from 1990-2013. So my count shows more than six, which would mean the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, I might have miscounted. Let me list each year:\n\n1990: US hosted and won \u2192 count\n1991: Not in table? No, the earliest is 1990.\nWait, looking back at the table provided, it starts from 2013 down to 1990. So in the table, for 1990-2013, how many times was the venue in the USA and the winning team the US?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1990: Venue in USA \u2192 yes\n1992: Scotland \u2192 no\n1994: Venue in USA \u2192 yes\n1996: Wales \u2192 no (not USA)\n1998: Venue in USA \u2192 yes\n2000: Scotland \u2192 no\n2002: Venue in USA \u2192 yes\n2003: Sweden \u2192 no\n2005: Venue in USA \u2192 yes\n2007: Sweden \u2192 no\n2009: Venue in USA \u2192 yes\n2011: Ireland \u2192 no\n2013: Venue in USA \u2192 yes\n\nSo, from 1990-2013, the US hosted and won in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2013. That's seven times, not six.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\n1. 1990\n2. 1994\n3. 1996: venue in USA but US didn't win? Wait no, in 1996 the US did win because the score was 17-11 and the winning team is listed as united states. So yes.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nIn 1990: united states won.\n1992: europe won.\n1994: united states won.\n1996: united states won.\n1998: united states won.\n2000: europe won.\n2002: united states won.\n2003: europe won.\n2005: united states won.\n2007: united states won.\n2009: united states won.\n2011: europe won.\n2013: united states won.\n\nSo from 1990 to 2013, the US hosted and won in 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013. That's nine times.\n\nBut the claim says six times. So that would be false.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant the US hosted regardless of who won? No, because the claim mentions both hosting and winning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me check each year:\n\n1990: Yes\n1992: No\n1994: Yes\n1996: Yes (US won)\n1998: Yes\n2000: No\n2002: Yes\n2003: No\n2005: Yes\n2007: Yes\n2009: Yes\n2011: No\n2013: Yes\n\nSo that's 1, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Wait no, from the list above, it's 1990, 94,96,98,02,05,07,09,13 \u2192 nine times.\n\nBut the claim says six times. So either I'm miscounting or the user is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user meant the US won regardless of hosting? Or perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps in some years the venue was not in the USA but the US team still won, like 2007 and 2009 were hosted by Sweden but the US team won. So does that count as hosting?\n\nNo, hosting refers to the location, so if it's hosted in Sweden, even if the US wins, it doesn't count towards the US hosting.\n\nSo my previous count is correct: from 1990-2013, the US hosted and won in nine instances. Therefore, the claim of six times is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires evaluating whether the United States hosted and won golf matches six times between 1990 and 2013 based on a provided table. After analyzing each year within this timeframe:\n\n1. **1990**: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 Count = 1\n2. **1991**: Not in table.\n3. **1992**: Hosted by Scotland, Europe won \u2192 No count.\n4. **1993**: Not in table.\n5. **1994**: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 Count = 2\n6. **1995**: Not in table.\n7. **1996**: Hosted by Wales, US won \u2192 Count = 3\n8. **1997**: Not in table.\n9. **1998**: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 Count = 4\n10. **1999**: Not in table.\n11. **2000**: Hosted by Scotland, Europe won \u2192 No count.\n12. **2001**: Not in table.\n13. **2002**: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 Count = 5\n14. **2003**: Hosted by Sweden, Europe won \u2192 No count.\n15. **2004**: Not in table.\n16. **2005**: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 Count = 6\n17. **2006**: Not in table.\n18. **2007**: Hosted by Sweden, US won \u2192 Count = 7 (Note: Hosting is in Sweden, but the US won.)\n19. **2008**: Not in table.\n20. **2009**: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 Count = 8\n21. **2010**: Not in table.\n22. **2011**: Hosted by Ireland, Europe won \u2192 No count.\n23. **2012**: Not in table.\n24. **2013**: Hosted by USA, US won \u2192 Count = 9\n\nThe analysis shows that the United States hosted and won golf matches nine times between 1990 and 2013. Therefore, the initial claim of six instances is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; the United States hosted and won golf matches nine times between 1990 and 2013, not six.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the highest score for a winning team be 18 , while the lowest score for a winning team be 13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: year, venue, winning team, score, usa captain, and europe captain.\n\nI need to focus on the \"score\" column because it's mentioned in the claim. The task is to find the highest and lowest scores by winning teams and see if they match 18 and 13 respectively.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 2013: Score is 18 -10 for Europe.\n- 2011: 15 -13 for Europe.\n- 2009: 16 -12 for USA.\n- 2007: 16 -12 for USA.\n- 2005: 15\u00bd -12\u00bd for USA.\n- 2003: 17\u00bd -10\u00bd for Europe.\n- 2002: 15\u00bd -12\u00bd for USA.\n- 2000:14\u00bd -11\u00bd for Europe.\n- 1998:16 -12 for USA.\n- 1996:17 -11 for USA.\n- 1994:13 -7 for USA.\n- 1992:11\u00bd -6\u00bd for Europe.\n- 1990:11\u00bd -4\u00bd for USA.\n\nSo, the scores are all in decimal or integer formats. The claim mentions the highest as 18 and lowest as 13.\n\nLooking at each score:\n\nThe maximum I see is 18 in 2013 for Europe. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking if any team scored 13. Scanning through the scores, I notice that in 1994, the USA won with a score of 13 -7. So, their score was exactly 13. That would be the lowest.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met: highest is 18 and lowest is 13.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no lower score than 13. Looking again, the next lowest is in 1990 with 11\u00bd for USA. But since the claim says \"lowest\" as 13, that would be incorrect if there are scores below 13. However, in this case, 13 is indeed the lowest among all winning team scores.\n\nSo, the claim seems to hold true based on the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
