    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Mark Lillis having the most total goals in the season is true or false. Let me start by looking at the table provided and understanding what each column represents.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the table to locate Mark Lillis's row. I see his name under the \"name\" column, and he's listed as a midfielder (mf). Now, I need to check the relevant columns for his total goals. From the table headers, I can see that there are several columns related to different competitions: league apps and goals, FA Cup apps and goals, League Cup apps and goals, and then \"total apps\" and \"total goals.\"\n\nSince the claim is about the \"most total goal of anyone in the season,\" I need to focus on the \"total goals\" column for each player. So, my main task is to compare Mark Lillis's total goals with everyone else's.\n\nLooking at Mark Lillis's row: his name is Mark Lillis, position mf, and in the \"total goals\" column, it says 20. That seems like a decent number, but I need to check if any other player has more than 20.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Terry Austin (fw) - total goals: 0\n2. Malcolm Brown (df) - total goals: 11\n3. David Burke (df) - total goals: 1\n4. David Cowling (mf) - total goals: 8\n5. Brian Cox (gk) - total goals: 0\n6. Maurice Cox (mf) - total goals: 1\n7. Steve Doyle (mf) - total goals: 2\n8. Roy Greenwood (df) - total goals: 0\n9. Keith Hanvey (df) - total goals: 4\n10. Timothy Hotte (fw) - total goals: 0\n11. Mick Laverick (mf) - total goals: 0\n12. Mark Lillis (mf) - total goals: 20\n13. Keith Mason (gk) - total goals: 0\n14. Daral Pugh (mf) - total goals: 2\n15. Colin Russell (fw) - total goals: 17\n16. Brian Stanton (mf) - total goals: 17\n17. Kevin Stonehouse (fw) - total goals: 0\n18. Dave Sutton (df) - total goals: 2\n19. Peter Valentine (df) - total goals: 0\n20. Phil Wilson (mf) - total goals: 6\n\nFrom this, I can see that Mark Lillis has 20 total goals, which is the highest so far. Next highest are Colin Russell and Brian Stanton with 17 each. None of the other players have more than 20.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, Mark Lillis does indeed have the most total goals in the season.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}]}",

    "claim": "4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 - 82 season",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination. The claim is: \"4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 -82 season.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column in the table represents. Looking at the table:\n\n- **name**: Player's name.\n- **position**: Their playing position (e.g., fw for forward).\n- The rest of the columns seem to be about apps (appearances) and goals in different competitions: league, fa cup, league cup, and total.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the 1982 -82 season. Since the table doesn't mention a specific season, I might need to assume that the data provided is for the 1982-82 season or perhaps that it's general, but given the context of player stats, it's likely that each row represents a player's stats up until the 1982-82 season.\n\nWait, looking closer at the table, some players have numbers in parentheses next to their \"league apps\" and \"total apps\". For example, maurice cox has (1) next to league apps, and his total apps are also (1). Steve Doyle has (1) in league apps and (1) in total. Similarly, Daral Pugh has (18) in league apps and (19) in total.\n\nThis suggests that the numbers might indicate substitute appearances or something similar. But since the claim is about \"4 people play the position of forward,\" I think we need to focus on the players who are forwards and count how many have played as forwards in that season.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see which positions are forwards (fw) and which are not. The relevant column for this claim would be \"position\" where it's fw.\n\nSo, first step: identify all the players who play as forward (position 'fw').\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. terry austin - position is fw.\n2. malcolm brown - df (defender).\n3. david burke - df.\n4. david cowling - mf (midfielder).\n5. brian cox - gk (goalkeeper).\n6. maurice cox - mf.\n7. steve doyle - mf.\n8. roy greenwood - df.\n9. keith hanvey - df.\n10. timothy hotte - fw.\n11. mick laverick - mf.\n12. mark lillis - mf.\n13. keith mason - gk.\n14. daral pugh - mf.\n15. colin russell - fw.\n16. brian stanton - mf.\n17. kevin stonehouse - fw.\n18. dave sutton - df.\n19. peter valentine - df.\n20. phil wilson - mf.\n\nNow, focusing on players with position 'fw':\n\n1. terry austin\n2. timothy hotte\n3. colin russell\n4. kevin stonehouse\n\nThat's four players who play as forwards (position 'fw'). So in the table provided, there are indeed 4 people who play forward.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, some of these have numbers in parentheses next to their stats. For example, maurice cox has 3(1) for league apps, meaning perhaps he started once? Or substituted once? Similarly, Steve Doyle has 41(1). So does that affect whether they played as forwards?\n\nWell, regardless of starting or substituting, the key point is their position. They are listed as forwards, so they count towards the number of forwards playing in that season.\n\nTherefore, since there are four players marked as 'fw', the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be those where \"position\" is 'fw' because that's what the claim is about. So for each of these four players, their row index and column name (which is \"position\") should be included.\n\nSo, let's list them:\n\n1. terry austin: row_index 0, column_name \"position\"\n2. timothy hotte: row_index 9, column_name \"position\"\n3. colin russell: row_index 14, column_name \"position\"\n4. kevin stonehouse: row_index 16, column_name \"position\"\n\nThese four cells are relevant because they indicate that each of these players is a forward, contributing to the total count of four forwards.\n\nI don't think any other columns would be relevant here since the claim is specifically about position being 'fw', so only the \"position\" column needs to be considered for each player.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 -82 season\" is true, we analyze the table focusing on players with the 'fw' (forward) position. There are four such players: Terry Austin, Timothy Hotte, Colin Russell, and Kevin Stonehouse. Each of these has their row index and position column as relevant cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Brian Stanton be 1 of 2 people who have more than 0 FA Cup goal.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The claim is saying that Brian Stanton is one of two players who have more than 0 goals in the FA Cup. So I need to check each relevant cell related to Brian Stanton and see if there's any other player with more than 0 FA Cup goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating Brian Stanton. His name is \"brian stanton\", so I should find his row. Scanning through the names: terry austin, malcolm brown, david burke, etc., until I see brian stanton at position 15. \n\nNow, focusing on his FA Cup stats. The table has columns for 'fa cup apps' and 'fa cup goals'. Let's look at Brian Stanton's row. Under 'fa cup apps', it says 4, and under 'fa cup goals', it's 2. So he has 2 FA Cup goals.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's another player with more than 0 FA Cup goals. I'll go through each player in the table and check their 'fa cup goals' column. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- terry austin: fa cup goals = 0\n- malcolm brown: fa cup goals =1 (more than 0)\nWait, so Malcolm Brown has 1 FA Cup goal. That means there's at least one other player besides Brian Stanton who has more than 0 FA Cup goals.\n\nSo the claim is that Brian Stanton is one of two players with more than 0 FA Cup goals. Since Malcolm Brown also has 1 goal, that makes it at least two players. Therefore, the statement holds true.\n\nWait, but I should check all other players to ensure no others have goals as well. Let's continue scanning:\n\n- maurice cox: 0\n- steve doyle: 0\n- roy greenwood: 0\n- keith hanvey: 0\n- timothy hotte: 0\n- mick laverick: 0\n- mark lillis: 0\n- keith mason: 0\n- daral pugh: 0 (though his apps are 18, but goals are 0)\n- colin russell: 0\n- brian stanton: 2\n- kevin stonehouse: 0\n- dave sutton: 0\n- peter valentine: 0\n- phil wilson: 0\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking back at the table, Malcolm Brown's row says 'fa cup apps' =4 and 'fa cup goals'=1. So he has 1 goal. That makes two players with more than 0 goals (Brian Stanton has 2, Malcolm Brown has 1). \n\nSo the claim is that Brian is one of two people with more than 0 FA Cup goals. Since there's at least Malcolm Brown, that makes it true.\n\nWait, but I should check if any other player besides these two also have more than 0 goals. From my scan above, no others do. So only Brian and Malcolm have more than 0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because he's one of two with more than 0 FA Cup goals.\n\nSo now, to structure this as per instructions, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for each player would be 'fa cup goals'. So for Brian Stanton, his row_index is 15, column_name is \"fa cup goals\". For Malcolm Brown, his row_index is 1, column_name is \"fa cup goals\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both of these.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Brian Stanton is one of two players with more than 0 FA Cup goals, we check each player's 'fa cup goals' stat. Both Malcolm Brown and Brian Stanton have values greater than 0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"Malcolm Brown have 3 more total apps than David Burke.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for Malcolm Brown and David Burke in the table. \n\nStarting with Malcolm Brown. Scanning through each row, I see his name in the first column. His position is 'df' which stands for defender. The numbers in his row are: league apps 46, league goals 9, FA Cup apps 4, FA Cup goals 1, League Cup apps 6, League Cup goals 1. Then total apps and total goals. Wait, let me check the columns again. Oh yes, there's 'total apps' and 'total goals'. So Malcolm Brown has a total of 56 apps (since it's under 'total apps').\n\nNow for David Burke. Looking through each row until I find his name. His position is also 'df'. The numbers: league apps 44, league goals 1, FA Cup apps 4, FA Cup goals 0, League Cup apps 5, League Cup goals 0. Total apps would be the sum of all these? Wait no, in the table, each row has 'total apps' and 'total goals'. So for David Burke, total apps are 53.\n\nThe claim is that Malcolm Brown has 3 more total apps than David Burke. So let's subtract: 56 (Malcolm) minus 53 (David) equals 3. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if I'm looking at the right numbers. Sometimes, in sports stats, 'apps' can mean appearances, so adding up league, FA Cup, and League Cup apps for total apps. But wait, looking back, no, the table already has a separate column for each competition's apps and goals, plus a total apps and total goals.\n\nSo yes, Malcolm Brown's total apps are 56 and David Burke's total apps are 53. The difference is indeed 3. So the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table. Malcolm Brown has 3 more total appearances (apps) than David Burke.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim made is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"Dave Sutton have 41 league apps while Phil Wilson have 45 league apps.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part of this statement means. It mentions two players, Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson, specifically their number of league apps (league applications). So, I need to locate both of these players in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a markdown table with several columns: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, and total goals. My focus is on the \"league apps\" column for both Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to find these players.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. The first row is Terry Austin. Not relevant.\n2. Malcolm Brown: Doesn't match either name.\n3. David Burke: No.\n4. David Cowling: No.\n5. Brian Cox: Gk, not relevant for now.\n6. Maurice Cox: mf, no.\n7. Steve Doyle: mf, but I'm looking for Dave and Phil.\n8. Roy Greenwood: df, no.\n9. Keith Hanvey: df, no.\n10. Timothy Hotte: fw, no.\n11. Mick Laverick: mf, no.\n12. Mark Lillis: mf, but not the right names.\n13. Keith Mason: gk, no.\n14. Daral Pugh: mf, but name doesn't match.\n15. Colin Russell: fw, no.\n16. Brian Stanton: mf, no, unless it's Phil.\n17. Kevin Stonehouse: fw, no.\n18. Dave Sutton: Here we go! I see him in the 18th row (index 18). His league apps are 41. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\n19. Peter Valentine: df, no.\n20. Phil Wilson: Found him here. He's in the 20th row. His league apps are 45. That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both players have the league apps as stated. Therefore, the claim is true based on their respective entries in the table.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For Dave Sutton, he's at row_index 18 (since it's zero-indexed, but looking at the markdown, each row starts with a name, so let me count properly). Wait, the first row is Terry Austin as index 0? Let me confirm:\n\nYes, the table starts with Terry Austin as row 0. So Dave Sutton is in row 18 (since he's the 19th entry, but zero-indexed it's 18). The column for league apps is \"league apps\". Similarly, Phil Wilson is in row 20 and same column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Dave Sutton: row_index 18, column_name \"league apps\"\n- For Phil Wilson: row_index 20, column_name \"league apps\"\n\nI should include these two as relevant_cells in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by comparing the \"total apps\" column for both individuals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dave sutton and phil wilson both have 44 league apps\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Dave Sutton in the table. Scanning through the names, I see Dave Sutton listed under the 'name' column with a position of df (defender). Now, I need to find his number of league apps. Looking at the 'league apps' column for Dave Sutton, it says 41.\n\nNext, I'll look for Phil Wilson in the table. He's also listed as a midfielder (mf) and is located further down the table. Checking his 'league apps', it shows 45.\n\nThe claim states that both have 44 league apps. But from the table, Dave Sutton has 41 league apps, and Phil Wilson has 45. Neither of them have 44 apps. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't misread anything. For Dave Sutton, it's clearly 41 under 'league apps'. For Phil Wilson, it's 45. No, that's correct. So both of them don't have 44; one has less and the other more.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is FALSE because neither Dave Sutton nor Phil Wilson have exactly 44 league applications. Therefore, I should mark the answer as \"FALSE\" and provide the relevant cells for their names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"dave sutton\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"phil wilson\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Brian Stanton be the only 1 who score fa cup goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is stating that Brian Stanton is the sole player who scored an FA Cup goal. So, my task is to look through the table and see if this is accurate.\n\nFirst, I should locate Brian Stanton in the table. Scanning down the 'name' column, I find Brian Stanton listed at row 14 (assuming rows start from 0). His position is 'mf', which stands for midfielder. \n\nLooking at the FA Cup-related columns for Brian Stanton: 'fa cup apps' and 'fa cup goals'. His 'fa cup apps' are 4, and his 'fa cup goals' are 2. That means he has scored 2 FA Cup goals.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players have scored FA Cup goals. I'll go through each player in the table one by one.\n\nStarting with Terry Austin: His FA Cup apps are 0 and goals 0. No contribution there.\nMalcolm Brown: FA Cup apps 4, goals 1. So he scored at least one FA Cup goal.\nDavid Burke: FA Cup apps 4, goals 0. No goals.\nDavid Cowling: FA Cup apps 4, goals 0. No goals.\nBrian Cox: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0. No goals.\nMaurice Cox: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0. No goals.\nSteve Doyle: FA Cup apps 4, goals 0. No goals.\nRoy Greenwood: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0 (but I see a (1) in the 'fa cup apps' column). Wait, looking again, his FA Cup apps are 0 and goals 0. So he didn't score any.\nKeith Hanvey: FA Cup apps 3, goals 0. No goals.\nTimothy Hotte: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0. No goals.\nMick Laverick: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0. No goals.\nMark Lillis: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0. Wait, no, his 'fa cup apps' are 4 and goals 0? Let me check again. Wait, the table shows for Mark Lillis, 'fa cup apps' is 0, and 'fa cup goals' is 0. So he didn't score any.\nKeith Mason: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0. No goals.\nDaral Pugh: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0 (but in his 'fa cup apps', it's written as 18 in parentheses). Wait, the 'fa cup apps' for Daral Pugh is 18? No, looking at row 15, it says 9 (18) in 'mf' position. Wait, no, the FA Cup columns: 'fa cup apps' is 0 and 'fa cup goals' is 1? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. For Daral Pugh, the 'name' is Daral Pugh, position mf. His league apps are 9 (18), which might be appearances including some substitutions or something, but for FA Cup: 'fa cup apps' is 0 and 'fa cup goals' is 1. So he scored one goal in FA Cup.\n\nWait, so Daral Pugh has scored at least one FA Cup goal.\n\nThen Colin Russell: His FA Cup apps are 4, goals 1. So he scored one.\nBrian Stanton: As mentioned, he scored 2 goals.\nKevin Stonehouse: FA Cup apps 0, goals 0.\nDave Sutton: FA Cup apps 4, goals 0. No goals.\nPeter Valentine: FA Cup apps 1, goals 0. Wait, no, the 'fa cup apps' for Peter Valentine is 1 and 'fa cup goals' is 0. So he didn't score.\nPhil Wilson: FA Cup apps 4, goals 0.\n\nWait, so let me list all players with FA Cup goals:\n\n- Malcolm Brown: 1\n- Daral Pugh: 1\n- Colin Russell: 1\n- Brian Stanton: 2\n\nThat's at least four players who have scored FA Cup goals. Therefore, Brian Stanton is not the only one.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't miss any others. Let me go through each player again quickly.\n\nTerry Austin: 0\nMalcolm Brown:1\nDavid Burke:0\nDavid Cowling:0\nBrian Cox:0\nMaurice Cox:0\nSteve Doyle:0\nRoy Greenwood:0\nKeith Hanvey:0\nTimothy Hotte:0\nMick Laverick:0\nMark Lillis:0\nKeith Mason:0\nDaral Pugh:1\nColin Russell:1\nBrian Stanton:2\nKevin Stonehouse:0\nDave Sutton:0\nPeter Valentine:0\nPhil Wilson:0\n\nSo, yes, four players have scored FA Cup goals. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Brian Stanton isn't the only one.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"fa cup apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"fa cup apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"fa cup apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"fa cup apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"}\n]}",
