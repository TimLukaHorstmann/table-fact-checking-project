    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Jabaquara is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim: \"Jabaquara lost 14 games and have 57 against.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The first part is about the number of losses Jabaquara has. Looking at the table, I need to find Jabaquara's row. Scanning through the 'team' column, I see that Jabaquara is listed in position 11. So, row index 11.\n\nIn row 11, under the 'lost' column, it says 14. That matches the first part of the claim, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the second part is about having 57 against. Again, looking at row 11, the 'against' column shows 57. So that also checks out.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I misread a number. Let me go through each step again. \n\nLooking for Jabaquara in the team column: yes, it's row 11. 'Lost' is 14, and 'against' is 57. The claim says they lost 14 games and have 57 against. Both numbers match exactly.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. There's no discrepancy or mismatch here. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
