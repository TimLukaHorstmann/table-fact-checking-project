    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Ben Frank is true based on the given table. Let me start by reading the claim carefully: \"ben frank have 30 cap for the hawke 's bay hurricane.\" Hmm, first off, I notice that there's a possible typo in the name. The table has \"Ben Franks\" as one of the players, not \"Ben Frank.\" So maybe the claim is referring to Ben Franks instead of someone else named Ben Frank.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I'll search for the player named Ben Franks. Scanning down the list, I see that Ben Franks is a prop with 30 caps, playing for Hawke's Bay Hurricanes. Wait, no, actually, checking the table again: Ben Franks is listed under \"player\" as \"Ben franks,\" and his \"club / province\" is \"hawke 's bay / hurricanes.\" So that matches the claim's part about the team.\n\nBut the name in the claim is \"ben frank\" while the correct name in the table is \"Ben franks.\" The capitalization might be different, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. In rugby player listings, names are often treated case-insensitively, so maybe it's just a typo in the claim.\n\nLooking at his caps, Ben Franks has 30 caps as per the table. So the cap number matches. The team is Hawke's Bay Hurricanes, which also aligns with the claim.\n\nWait, but in the table, the \"caps\" column for Ben Franks is listed as 30. That's correct. So all parts of the claim seem to be accurate: 30 caps and playing for Hawke's Bay Hurricanes. However, I'm a bit confused because the table entry has \"hawke 's bay / hurricanes,\" but in the claim, it's written as \"hawke 's bay hurricane.\" Maybe that's just a slight variation in the phrasing.\n\nSo considering all this, the claim seems to be correct based on the data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"club / province\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
