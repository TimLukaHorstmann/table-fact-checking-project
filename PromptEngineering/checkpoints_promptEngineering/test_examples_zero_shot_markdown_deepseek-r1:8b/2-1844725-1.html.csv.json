    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says: \"the dimension of the amp with a 180w output be 29x11x11in 74x28x28 cm\".\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row in the table where the output is 180 watts. Scanning through each model:\n\n- vh4: 90 - 160w\n- vh4s: 2 50w\n- herbert: 180w\n- hagen: 100w\n- d - moll: 100w\n- schmidt: 15 - 30w\n- lucy (bass amp): tba\n\nSo, the model with 180w output is 'herbert' in row index 2.\n\nNow, I'll check the dimensions for this model. The column for dimensions is \"dimensions\". Looking at row 2, under \"dimensions\": it's listed as \"29\u2009\u200911\u2009\u200911in 74\u2009\u200928\u2009\u200928cm\". Wait, but in the table, the dimensions for herbert are written as \"29\u200911\u200911in 74\u200928\u200928cm\". The claim says \"29x11x11in 74x28x28 cm\", which seems to match exactly. \n\nI should also check if any other rows might have a 180w output but that's not the case here. So, the relevant cell is row index 2 and column \"dimensions\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the dimensions match for the model with 180w output.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"dimensions\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the amp dimension of the herbet be the same as the hagen\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim is talking about two amps: Herbert and Hagen. It says their dimensions are the same. So, I need to compare their dimensions as listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different model with various attributes like poweramp type, dimensions, mass, etc. My focus here is on the 'dimensions' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLet me locate Herbert and Hagen in the table. Herbert is the third entry in the table, and Hagen is the fourth. Now, I'll check their respective dimensions.\n\nHerbert's row has \"29\u2009\u200911\u2009\u200911\u2009in 74\u2009\u200928\u2009\u200928\u2009cm\" under dimensions. Hagen's row also lists \"29\u2009\u200911\u2009\u200911\u2009in 74\u2009\u200928\u2009\u200928\u2009cm\". Wait, those are exactly the same numbers. So both Herbert and Hagen have the same dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the claim that their amp dimensions are the same is true because their dimensions match exactly in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare the 'dimensions' of Herbert and Hagen from the table. Both have identical dimensions as per the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"dimensions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"dimensions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
