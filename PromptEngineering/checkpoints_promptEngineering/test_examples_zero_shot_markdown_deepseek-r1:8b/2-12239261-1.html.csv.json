    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells in the table that support the claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: series, season, host, tests, england, west indies, draw, series result, and holder at the end of the series. Each row represents a different series with various data points.\n\nThe claim is: \"during season 1991 , west indie be the holder at the end of the series and the host england be 5 and have the result of series drawn.\"\n\nSo, breaking down the claim:\n\n1. **Season**: 1991\n2. **Holder**: West Indies (should check if they are the holders at the end of that series)\n3. **Host**: England with a value of 5 in their column\n4. **Result**: Series drawn\n\nNow, I need to look through each row of the table to find the one that matches these conditions.\n\nStarting by locating season 1991 in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 14: Season is 1991\n- Let's check row 14 for all relevant data.\n\nIn row 14:\n- series: 14\n- season: 1991\n- host: england\n- tests: 5\n- england: 2 (but the claim mentions the host's value as 5, so this might not directly match)\nWait, no, actually, the host is \"england\" with tests being 5. The claim says the host is England and has 5, which aligns.\n\nNext, check if West Indies are the holders at the end of that series. Looking at the column \"holder at the end of the series\" for row 14: it's west indies. So that matches.\n\nThen, the result of the series is listed as \"series drawn\". In the table, the column \"series result\" for row 14 is indeed \"series drawn\".\n\nSo all conditions seem to be met in row 14.\n\nWait, but looking back at the host's data: the claim says the host has 5 tests. In row 14, the number under \"tests\" is 5, which matches. So yes, that aligns.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure there are no other rows that might inadvertently match or if there's an error in my analysis. Let me check adjacent rows for season 1991 to ensure it's only row 14.\n\nLooking at the table, after row 13 is 1991, so row 14 is indeed the only one with season 1991.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by row 14.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about season 1991, we need to check if West Indies are the holders, England hosted with 5 tests, and the series result was a draw. These details are found in row 14 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"holder at the end of the series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"series result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
