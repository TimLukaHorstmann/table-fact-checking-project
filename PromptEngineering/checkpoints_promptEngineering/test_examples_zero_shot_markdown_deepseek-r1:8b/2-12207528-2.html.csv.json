It seems to be about a game between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Mariners on April 4th.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different date with various details like opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. My task is to check if any relevant cells in the table support this claim.\n\nThe key parts of the claim are:\n1. Toronto Blue Jays (opponent)\n2. Mariners (opponent)\n3. April 4th (date)\n\nSo I need to find a row where the opponent is \"Mariners\" and the date is April 4th. Scanning through the table, let's look at each date:\n\n- April 4: Opponent is Mariners\n- April 5: Opponent is Mariners\n- April 6: Opponent is Angels\n- April 7: Opponent is Angels\n- And so on...\n\nOn April 4, the opponent is indeed the Mariners. So this row seems relevant.\n\nNow, checking the other details of the claim:\n- The score was 3 - 2 (10). That's provided in the table.\n- The loss is mentioned as lamp (0 - 1), which matches the table.\n- Attendance is 43200, which aligns with the table.\n- The record after this game would be 0 - 1, which also matches.\n\nSince all these details are present in the row for April 4 against Mariners, the claim is fully supported.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play royal 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to be about a game involving the Toronto Blue Jays playing against a team called \"royal.\" Now, in Major League Baseball (MLB), there are several teams named Royal, such as the Kansas City Royals and the Baltimore Orioles, among others. However, the table provided lists opponents like Mariners, Angels, Athletics, Rangers, Orioles, Royals, etc.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that there are entries for \"royals\" as an opponent on multiple dates in April. For example:\n\n- On April 27, the Blue Jays play against Royals with a score of 1 - 0.\n- On April 28, they play Royals again and win 6 - 0.\n\nHowever, the claim mentions \"play royal 3 time,\" which I interpret as playing Royal three times or on three occasions. From the table, I can check how many times the Blue Jays played against Royals in April 2023.\n\nCounting the entries:\n\n- April 27: Royals\n- April 28: Royals\n\nThat's two games in April. Additionally, there are mentions of games rescheduled from April to July or May, but those aren't part of April. So in April itself, they played Royals twice.\n\nThe claim says \"play royal 3 time,\" implying three times. Since the table only shows two games against Royals in April, the claim might be FALSE. However, I should double-check if there are more entries for Royals in other months or if any rescheduled games count towards the total in April.\n\nWait, on April 29 and 30, some games were postponed but rescheduled to July and May. Since those are not part of April's actual games, they shouldn't be counted towards the April schedule. Therefore, only two Royal games in April.\n\nSo the claim that they played Royals three times in April isn't supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I analyzed the provided table for the Toronto Blue Jays' games against the Royals in April 2023. The table shows two games against Royals on April 27 and 28, 2023. The claim mentions three games, which isn't supported by the data. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two teams: Toronto Blue Jay and Royal, and the date April 30th. So I need to see if there was a game between these two teams on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns include date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. My focus is on the \"opponent\" column because it tells me who Toronto Blue Jay played against on each date.\n\nI'll go through the table row by row to find any entry where the opponent is Royal and the date is April 30th.\n\nStarting from April 4 to April 29, I don't see any games where the opponent is Royal. For example:\n- On April 7, they played against Angels.\n- On April 13, against Rangers.\n- On April 17, against Orioles.\n- The only Royal game I notice is on April 27 and April 28, both against Royals as the opponent.\n\nWait, looking at April 30th: the row says \"rangers\" as the opponent. There's no mention of a Royal opponent on that date. \n\nSo, on April 30th, the opponent was Rangers, not Royals. Therefore, there is no game between Toronto Blue Jay and Royal on April 30th.\n\nSince the claim states they played each other on April 30th, which isn't supported by the table data provided, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim itself. It mentions two teams: Toronto Blue Jays and Athletics, playing on April 28. Looking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific date, opponent, score, etc.\n\nSo, my goal is to find out if there's an entry in the table for April 28 where the home team is the Blue Jays and the opponent is the Athletics. Alternatively, if it's listed as postponed or rescheduled, that might affect the claim.\n\nLet me go through each step:\n\n1. **Identify the date:** April 28.\n2. **Check the opponents on April 28 in the table.** Looking at the table, I'll look for a row with date \"april 28\".\n\nScanning down, I find the row for april 28:\n- Opponent: royals\n- The score is 6 - 0.\n- The loss column says saberhagen (1 - 1).\n- Attendance and record are also filled in.\n\nSo, on April 28, the Blue Jays played against the Royals, not the Athletics. That already suggests that the claim might be FALSE.\n\n3. **Check if any games were postponed or rescheduled to April 28 involving these teams.** For example, maybe a game originally scheduled for another date was moved to April 28 between the Blue Jays and Athletics.\n\nLooking at other dates around April 28:\n- April 29 had a postponed game due to rain, but it's against the Royals.\n- April 30 also had a postponement, which was rescheduled to May 1. But that's against the Rangers.\n\nI don't see any entries for Blue Jays playing the Athletics on April 28 or any rescheduling that would make that date their match.\n\n4. **Double-check if the table lists any game between Blue Jays and Athletics on April 28.** From scanning, I don't recall such a row. The Blue Jays played against several teams in April, including Mariners, Angels, Athletics (on different dates), Royals, etc., but not the Athletics on April 28.\n\nTherefore, putting this together: The claim states that Blue Jays and Athletics played on April 28. According to the table, they were supposed to play the Royals on that date. No such game exists between Blue Jays and Athletics on April 28 in the table provided.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Athletics on April 28.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play angel on april 9\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two teams: Toronto Blue Jay and Angel. Looking at the table, the opponents column lists each game's opposing team. So I'll need to check if \"Angel\" is an opponent on April 9th.\n\nNext, I'll look for the row where the date is April 9. Scanning through the table, I see that April 9 has the Angels as the opponent. That matches part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking if Toronto Blue Jay is mentioned anywhere in the table. The opponents column doesn't have \"Toronto Blue Jay\" listed; instead, the home team might be different each game. The table's first row shows Seattle Mariners as the opponent for April 4, and so on. Since I'm not seeing Toronto Blue Jay as an opponent on April 9th or any other date, they aren't part of this particular table.\n\nSo, the claim says that Toronto Blue Jay played Angel on April 9. The table confirms that the Angels were the opponents on April 9, but it doesn't list Toronto Blue Jay as either the home or away team for that game.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play mariner 5 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll break down the claim to understand what it's asking for.\n\nThe claim mentions three things: \"toronto blue jay,\" \"play,\" \"mariner 5 time.\" From this, I can infer that the claim is likely about a game between two teams, one being the Toronto Blue Jays and the other possibly the Seattle Mariners, scheduled on a specific date with a score of 5-3 in favor of either team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game played by what I assume is a home team against various opponents. The \"opponent\" column lists the teams they're playing against each day. So, if the Blue Jays are playing, their opponent would be listed as \"mariners,\" which I believe refers to the Seattle Mariners.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's a game where the Blue Jays play the Mariners with a score of 5-3. The table has several games involving the Blue Jays and other opponents. For example:\n\nOn April 4, the opponent is mariners, but the score is 3-2 in favor of the Blue Jays.\n\nOn April 20, they play against the angels (Angels), with a final score of 10-6.\n\nOn April 21, it's 8-4 in favor of the Blue Jays against angels again.\n\nApril 22: 9-6 win.\n\nBut I don't see any game where the opponent is mariners and the Blue Jays have a score of 5-3. Wait, maybe I need to check each row for \"mariners\" as the opponent and then see if the Blue Jays won with a 5-3 score.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nApril 4: Blue Jays vs Mariners, score 3-2 (Blue Jays win)\nApril 23: Blue Jays vs Mariners, score 8-5 (win)\nApril 24: 4-2 loss\nI don't see any game where Blue Jays play Mariners and have a 5-3 score. Similarly, in the later dates like April 29 and 30, they have postponed games, but not against Mariners.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for any game where the opponent is \"mariners\" and the Blue Jays scored 5-3. But from the table provided, I don't see such a game. The closest is April 4 with a score of 3-2 and April 23 with an 8-5 win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the Mariners playing against someone else, but the home team is Blue Jays. Wait, no, the \"opponent\" column shows who they're playing against each day. So if Blue Jays are the home team, their opponent would be listed as mariners when Mariners come to town.\n\nI don't see any game where Blue Jays play the Mariners with a 5-3 score in favor of either team. The only times they face each other result in scores like 3-2, 8-5, etc., but not 5-3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is likely false because there's no evidence in the table of a game where Toronto Blue Jays play the Mariners with a final score of 5-3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play royal 4 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should break down the claim into its components to see what each part means and then cross-reference that with the table.\n\nThe claim has three main parts: \"toronto blue jay,\" \"play royal,\" and \"4 time.\" Let me analyze each part step by step.\n\nStarting with \"toronto blue jay.\" The team name is Toronto Blue Jays. In the table, I look for any mention of this team. Scanning through the opponents column, I see teams like Mariners, Angels, Athletics, Rangers, Orioles, Royals, and then on April 29 and 30, there's a mention of Royals with some game statuses, but nothing about Blue Jays. So it seems like none of the games in the table are against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nNext, \"play royal.\" The term \"royal\" could refer to the Kansas City Royals or perhaps another team. In the table, I see opponents named Royals on April 27 and 28, with both games being against the Royals. So those rows (27 and 28) are relevant because they involve a team referred to as Royals.\n\nLastly, \"4 time.\" This part is a bit unclear. It could mean that the Blue Jays played the Royals four times in some context, like four games or something similar. Looking at the table from April 27 and 28, those are two games against Royals. On April 29, the game was postponed due to rain and rescheduled for July 23, but there's no mention of a fourth game between Blue Jays and Royals in this table.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim suggests that the Toronto Blue Jays played the Royals four times. However, based on the table provided:\n\n1. There are no games against the Toronto Blue Jays listed.\n2. Only two games against Royals are shown (April 27 and 28).\n3. A third game was postponed and rescheduled for July 23, so it's not included here.\n\nTherefore, there isn't enough evidence in this table to support the claim that the Blue Jays played the Royals four times. The relevant cells would be the ones where the Royals played (April 27 and 28), but since the Blue Jays aren't involved in any of these games, the overall claim doesn't hold true.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"toronto blue jay play royal 4 time,\" we need to check if Toronto Blue Jays played against Kansas City Royals four times according to the table. \n\n1. **Opponent Analysis**: The opponents listed are Mariners, Angels, Athletics, Rangers, Orioles, and Royals.\n2. **Royal Games**: Only two games against Royals (April 27 and 28) are present in the table, with another postponed.\n3. **Blue Jays Absence**: No games involving Toronto Blue Jays are present.\n\nSince there's no mention of Blue Jays playing Royals four times, the claim is unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions three main things: the team name (\"toronto blue jay\"), the opponent (\"royal\"), and the date (\"april 26\").\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played on a specific date. The columns we have are date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record.\n\nI need to check if there's a game where the home team is the Toronto Blue Jays playing against the Royals on April 26.\n\nSo, I'll start by finding all entries for April 26 in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first few rows are from April 4 onwards. Let me go directly to April 26.\n\nLooking at the date column, there's an entry for April 26: \"april 26 | athletics | 7 - 4 ...\" So that game was against the Athletics with a score of 7-4. The opponent isn't the Royals here, it's the Athletics.\n\nWait, but then I notice another April 26 row? No, checking again, each date only appears once in the table provided. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check if there are any other entries for April 26 beyond what's shown. In the table, the last few rows include up to April 30, so April 26 is present once against Athletics.\n\nNow, looking for a game where the opponent is Royals on April 26. Wait, in the claim, it's \"royal\" as the opponent, which might be shorthand for Kansas City Royals. In the table, one of the opponents listed is 'royals', so that matches.\n\nBut I didn't find any entry for Royals on April 26. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- April 4: Mariners\n- April 5: Mariners\n- April 6: Angels\n- April 7: Angels\n- April 8: Angels\n- April 9: Athletics\n- April 10: Athletics\n- April 13: Rangers\n- April 14: Rangers\n- April 15: Rangers\n- April 17: Orioles\n- April 18: Orioles\n- April 19: Orioles\n- April 20: Angels\n- April 21: Angels\n- April 22: Angels\n- April 23: Mariners\n- April 24: Mariners\n- April 25: Athletics\n- April 26: Athletics\n- April 27: Royals (opponent is royals)\n- April 28: Royals\n- April 29: Royals but postponed\n- April 30: Rangers, postponed.\n\nWait a minute, so on April 26, the game was against Athletics. Then on April 27, they played Royals, with the score 1-0 and the loss by Gubicza. So that's when they played the Royals, not on the 26th but on the 27th.\n\nSo the claim says they played on April 26 against Royals, but according to the table, it was April 27 when they faced Royals. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the game happened a day later.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another row for April 26 that I might have missed? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table provided, each date from April 4 to April 30 is listed, but only once per date. So April 26 has one entry against Athletics. Then on April 27, they played Royals.\n\nTherefore, there's no game on April 26 where they played Royals.

So, I need to check if there's any information in the table about a game between these two teams on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like the date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play angel on april 29\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions that the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Angels on April 29th. Looking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific date and opponent. My task is to check if there's any entry in the table for April 29 where the opponent is the Angels.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row of the table until I find the one with the date April 29. Here's what I see:\n\n- The rows go from april 4 to april 30.\n- Scanning through, I see that on april 29, the opponent is listed as \"royals.\" So the game was against the Royals, not the Angels.\n\nWait, but the claim says they played against the Angels. Since the table doesn't show any game between the Blue Jays and the Angels on April 29, this suggests that such a game didn't occur according to the data provided.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any rescheduling or other entries for April 29 related to the Angels. The row for april 29 shows that it was postponed due to rain and rescheduled for July 23. There's no mention of a game against the Angels on April 29th in the table.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the claim is not supported by the data. It looks like the Blue Jays were playing the Royals on that date, not the Angels.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"toronto blue jay play angel on april 29\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check the table for any entry where the opponent is the Angels on April 29.\n\n1. **Reviewing the Table**: The row for April 29 shows the opponent as \"royals,\" not the Angels.\n2. **Checking for Reschedules**: There's no mention of a game against the Angels being rescheduled to April 29; instead, it was postponed and later rescheduled for July 23.\n\nSince there is no entry in the table indicating that the Toronto Blue Jays played the Angels on April 29, the claim is not supported by the provided data.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
