    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about Michael Schumacher is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Michael Schumacher be the driver whose constructor is Ferrari have an average grid number of 1 with time / retired of 1:32:35.101.\"\n\nWait, that wording is a bit confusing. I think it means Michael Schumacher is a driver for Ferrari and his average grid position is 1. But looking at the table, each driver has specific information.\n\nI'll start by identifying which parts of the claim need to be checked against the table.\n\nThe relevant columns are:\n- Driver: To find Michael Schumacher.\n- Constructor: Should be Ferrari.\n- laps: I think this refers to the number of laps completed, but it's about average grid, so maybe not directly relevant.\n- time / retired: This should match 1:32:35.101.\n- grid: This is the starting position; we need the average to be 1.\n\nWait, the term \"average grid number\" isn't explicitly in the table. The table shows each race's grid position, but does it show averages? Or maybe the claim is simplifying it as just having a grid of 1 for that driver.\n\nLooking at the table, Michael Schumacher has:\n- Driver: michael schumacher\n- Constructor: ferrari\n- laps: 60\n- time / retired: 1:32:35.101\n- grid: 1\n\nSo his starting position (grid) is 1, and he completed 60 laps without retiring or timing out.\n\nThe claim says his average grid is 1, but the table shows only one race here, so I think it's implying that in this specific case, his grid was 1. If there's only one race, average would be same as the single value.\n\nWait, maybe \"average\" is a misinterpretation. Perhaps the claim means he started at position 1 for that race. So checking if Michael Schumacher had constructor Ferrari, grid of 1, and time 1:32:35.101.\n\nLooking back:\n- Driver column: michael schumacher matches.\n- Constructor column: ferrari matches.\n- time / retired: 1:32:35.101 matches.\n- grid: 1.\n\nSo all the specific details in the claim are satisfied by Michael Schumacher's entry in the table. Therefore, the claim is true based on this data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}]}",
