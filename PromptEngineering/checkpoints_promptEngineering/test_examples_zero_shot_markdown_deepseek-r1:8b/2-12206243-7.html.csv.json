    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the record for June 13 be 29 - 32\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant row in the table. The date mentioned is June 13. Looking at the table headers, the first column is \"date,\" and under that, it says \"june 13.\" So that's definitely the row we're focusing on.\n\nNext, I should check what the record is for June 13. The record column shows the team's overall performance up to that date. For June 13, according to the table, the record is listed as \"29 - 32.\"\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Scanning through each row: June 1 has 26-26, then June 2 is 26-27, and so on until June 13. Yeah, on June 13, it's 29-32.\n\nSo the claim states that on June 13, the record was 29-32. That matches exactly with what's in the table. There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy here.\n\nI don't see any other columns relevant to this specific check. The opponent and score are more about individual game outcomes, while the loss details might not directly affect the overall team record unless there's a pattern, which isn't what the claim is about. The attendance is also provided but doesn't pertain to the record itself.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim correspond correctly with the table data, the statement should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"record\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the record for june 13 be under 29 - 32\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that on June 13th, the team's record was below 29-32.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different date, opponent, score, loss details, attendance, and the overall record. So for June 13, I should find the corresponding row. Scanning through the dates, I see that June 13 is when the Philadelphia Phillies were the opponents. The score was 4-3, and the loss was by Spoljaric with a pitching record of 0-3.\n\nNow, checking the 'record' column for that date: it says 29 - 32. So on June 13th, the team's record was exactly 29-32. The claim is that this record was under 29-32. Since \"under\" would mean less than 29-32, which isn't the case here\u2014it's equal to\u2014the claim is false.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how \"under\" is interpreted. If someone says a record is under 29-32, does that include the exact 29-32? Typically, in sports records, \"under\" would mean below that number. So if they had 28-32 or lower, it's under. But here it's exactly 29-32, so the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the relevant cells are only June 13th's record column because that's where the specific team performance is recorded.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
