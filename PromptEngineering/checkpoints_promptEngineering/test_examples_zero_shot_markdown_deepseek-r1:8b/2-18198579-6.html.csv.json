The claim says, \"earnings of 7603184 total be make from 2004 - 2013.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which part of the claim relates to the table data. The key term here is \"earnings,\" so I need to look at the column named \"earnings\" in the table. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 2004 to 2013 and includes various statistics like tournaments played, cuts made, wins, etc., including \"earnings.\" The last row has a total earnings of 7,603,184. \n\nSo, I need to see if that total is present in the table as the \"earnings\" column for any year from 2004 to 2013. Since the total is listed at the bottom of the table under the totals row, it should be correct.\n\nWait, but does the claim specify that the earnings are a total from 2004 to 2013? Yes, it says \"from 2004 - 2013.\" So the 7,603,184 figure in the last row is exactly the cumulative earnings for all those years combined. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is the one under \"earnings\" with a value of 7,603,184.\n</think>\n\nThe total earnings for the years 2004 to 2013 are listed as 7,603,184. This matches the claim exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"earnings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells in the table support the claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. The claim says: \"earnings of 2335460 total be made during 2013.\" So, they're claiming that in 2013, the total earnings were $2,335,460.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a specific year from 2004 to 2013. For 2013, I should focus on the 'year' column and find its corresponding row. \n\nIn the table, under the 'earnings' column for the year 2013, the value is listed as $2,335,460. This matches exactly with the number in the claim. \n\nNext, I need to check if any other cells are relevant. The 'year' cell for 2013 would be at row index 9 since the years start from 2004 (row 0) up to totals (row 13). So, row_index 9 corresponds to 2013.\n\nThe claim is specifically about earnings in 2013, so only the 'earnings' column and the 'year' cell are relevant here. However, I think the main point is just the earnings value, but according to the instructions, we need to list all relevant cells that help verify the claim. Since the year is part of confirming which row's data to check, it's also relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n1. The cell at row_index 9 for 'year' to confirm it's 2013.\n2. The cell at row_index 9 for 'earnings' to verify the amount matches.\n\nTherefore, both these cells support the claim that in 2013, the total earnings were $2,335,460.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the 'earnings' value in 2013 matching exactly with the stated figure. The relevant cells are the year and earnings columns for 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"earnings of 2287080 total be made during 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a year from 2004 to 2013, and each column provides various statistics related to tournaments played, cuts made, wins, top 10s, best finish, earnings, money list rank, scoring average, and scoring rank.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"earnings\" for the year 2012. So my focus should be on the row corresponding to 2012 and the column named \"earnings.\"\n\nLooking at the table, under the year 2012, I see that the earnings column has a value of 2287080. This matches exactly what the claim states: 2287080 total earnings made during 2012.\n\nNow, I should verify if there are any other relevant cells. The claim refers to \"total be make,\" which seems like a typo for \"made.\" However, looking at the table, the earnings column is clearly labeled as \"earnings,\" so that's the only relevant cell here.\n\nI don't see any other columns or rows that would affect this check. For instance, the money list rank and scoring average are different metrics and not part of the earnings total. Therefore, the only relevant cell to check is the \"earnings\" column in the 2012 row.\n\nSince the value in that specific cell matches the claim, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns are:\n\n- year\n- tournaments played\n- cuts made\n- wins\n- top 10s\n- best finish\n- earnings\n- money list rank\n- scoring average\n- scoring rank\n\nThe claim is about earnings, specifically \"earnings of 365231 total be made during 2011.\" So I need to check the 'earnings' column for the year 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific year. For 2011, let's find the corresponding row. Scanning through, I see that 2011 is indeed one of the rows (row index 8). \n\nIn that row, the 'earnings' cell has the value 365231. The claim states that this amount was made during 2011, which matches exactly with what's in the table.\n\nNow, to make sure there are no discrepancies or other factors that might affect this conclusion. The claim doesn't mention anything about total earnings beyond 2011, so it's a straightforward comparison between the claimed value and the table data.\n\nTherefore, since the 'earnings' for 2011 is indeed 365231 as per the table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"earnings of 825477 total be make during 2011.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The term \"earnings\" likely refers to the total money earned by someone, probably a golfer, in a particular year. The value given here is 825477.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column called \"earnings,\" and another column called \"money list rank.\" Each row represents a different year from 2004 to 2013, with totals at the bottom.\n\nSo I need to look for the year 2011 in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that 2011 is indeed one of the years, specifically row number 7 (since it starts counting from 2004 as row 0 or something? Wait, looking again: the first data row after the headers is 2004, so 2004 is row index 0. Then 2005 is 1, up to 2013 being row 9. So 2011 would be row index 7.\n\nIn that row for 2011, I see \"earnings\" as 365231 and the money list rank as 31. Wait, but the claim says the earnings were 825477 during 2011. That doesn't match because the table shows 365,231 for 2011.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"earnings.\" Could it refer to something else? Alternatively, perhaps the totals include all years up to that point, but no, the table seems to list annual earnings, with a total at the bottom. Wait, the last row is labeled \"totals,\" so maybe each row is an individual's performance in that year.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I think this might be for Tiger Woods because his name isn't mentioned, but his earnings are known. Let me focus on the data.\n\nIn 2011, the earnings were 365,231 according to the table. The claim says it was 825,477. Those numbers don't match, so if the claim states that the total earnings during 2011 were 825k, but the table shows only about 365k, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, checking other columns: wins, top 10s, best finish, etc., for 2011, there are 0 wins, 3 top 10s, and a best finish of t6. But none of these affect the earnings part directly.\n\nSo, based on the table data for 2011, the earnings were not 825,477 but 365,231. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Tiger Woods' earnings in 2011 being 825,477 is incorrect as per the table, which lists his earnings that year as 365,231.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"earnings from 2009 to 2012 be less than 500000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking for. It wants me to check if the total earnings from the years 2009 through 2012 are each individually less than $500,000. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as the sum of these four years being less than $500,000, but since the table provides separate earnings figures for each year, I think it's more likely referring to each individual year's earnings.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific year from 2004 to 2013. The relevant column here is \"earnings,\" which is labeled in the table as \"earnings.\" So I need to focus on that column for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\nLet me extract the earnings data for these years:\n\n- 2009: $271,303\n- 2010: $825,477\n- 2011: $365,231\n- 2012: $2,285,080\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the claim. The claim says \"earnings... be less than 500000.\" \n\nStarting with 2009: $271,303 is indeed less than $500,000. So that's TRUE for this year.\n\nNext, 2010: $825,477. This is greater than $500,000 because $825k is more than double the claim's threshold. Therefore, this year's earnings are not less than $500,000, making the entire claim FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I should check all four years to be thorough.\n\n2011: $365,231 is also less than $500,000, so that's TRUE for 2011.\n\n2012: $2,285,080 is way over the $500k mark. So this year also doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nSince the claim requires that all four years (2009-2012) have earnings less than $500k, but at least two of them (2010 and 2012) exceed that amount, the overall claim must be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim was about the total earnings from these four years being less than $500k, then let's calculate that:\n\n$271,303 + $825,477 + $365,231 + $2,285,080 = $3,467,091, which is way over $500k. So even if interpreting as a total sum, the claim would still be FALSE.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether we look at individual years or the total sum, the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2010, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2011, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2012, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nAnswer: FALSE  \nRelevant cells: [  \n  {\"row_index\":2009,\"column_name\":\"earnings\"},  \n  {\"row_index\":2010,\"column_name\":\"earnings\"},  \n  {\"row_index\":2011,\"column_name\":\"earnings\"},  \n  {\"row_index\":2012,\"column_name\":\"earnings\"}  \n]",

The claim is that \"during 2013 earnings be a mere 10000.\" Hmm, first I need to figure out what each part of the claim refers to in the table.\n\nLet me break down the claim. It mentions \"earnings,\" so I should look for the column related to earnings. Looking at the table, there's a column called \"Earnings\" which is abbreviated as \"earnings.\" Then it says \"during 2013,\" so I need to check the year 2013 row.\n\nIn the table, 2013 is one of the years listed, so that part checks out. The claim states that earnings were a mere $10,000. Now I need to look at the value in the \"Earnings\" column for 2013.\n\nLooking at the 2013 row, under \"Earnings,\" it says \"2335460.\" Wait, that's a large number, like over two million, not ten thousand. That doesn't match the claim of $10,000. So the earnings part of the claim is false because the actual earnings for 2013 were much higher.\n\nI don't think I need to check other columns unless there's a misunderstanding.

Scanning through the rows, I see that 2012 is row number 8 (since it starts from 2004 as row 0). Now, looking at the columns relevant to earnings, there's \"earnings\" and \"money list rank.\" The claim specifically mentions earnings, so I should focus on that column.\n\nIn the 2012 row, under the \"earnings\" column, the value is 2287080. The claim says the earnings are over 5,000,000. Wait, 2,287,080 is less than 5,000,000. So, at first glance, it seems like the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut I should also check if there's any other relevant information that might affect this conclusion. The \"money list rank\" for 2012 is 1, which probably means they earned the most that year, but their total earnings are still under 5 million. So that doesn't change the fact that 2287080 is less than 5000000.\n\nI don't see any other columns that directly relate to the claim about earnings in 2012. The \"cuts made\" or \"wins\" don't impact the total earnings, so they aren't relevant here. Therefore, the only relevant cell is the \"earnings\" column for 2012.\n\nSince 2287080 is not over 5,000,000, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2012, the earnings were over 5,000,000.
