    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"there be 8 games at the boston garden, all before december 17\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that there are 8 games played at the Boston Garden where all these games occurred before December 17th.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has several columns: game number, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record. The 'location / attendance' column seems to indicate where the game was held. \n\nI need to focus on the 'game' number, 'date', 'opponent', 'score', 'location / attendance', and 'record' columns. But specifically, I'm looking for games that were played at the Boston Garden and check if there are exactly 8 such games before December 17th.\n\nSo my first step is to identify all the rows where the location/attendance is \"boston garden\" and then see how many of those have a date before December 17. Then, I count these to see if it's exactly 8.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 20: December 3 vs Philadelphia 76ers at Boston Garden.\nRow 21: Dec 4 vs St Louis Hawks at St Louis Arena.\nRow 22: Dec 5 vs Cincinnati Royals at Cincinnati.\nRow 23: Dec 7 vs St Louis Hawks at New York, NY.\nRow 24: Dec 8 vs LA Lakers at Boston Garden.\nRow 25: Dec 11 vs SF Warriors at Boston Garden.\nRow 26: Dec 15 vs Cincinnati Royals at Boston Garden.\nRow 27: Dec 17 vs Detroit Pistons at Detroit.\n\nSo the games at Boston Garden are rows 20, 24, 25, and 26. Wait, that's four games. But wait, row 20 is Dec 3, 24 is Dec 8, 25 is Dec 11, and 26 is Dec 15. All these dates are before December 17th because December 17 is later in the month.\n\nWait a minute, let me count again. \n\nLooking at each game:\n\n- Game 20: December 3rd.\n- Game 24: December 8th.\n- Game 25: December 11th.\n- Game 26: December 15th.\n\nThat's four games at Boston Garden before December 17th. So the claim says there are 8 such games, but I only count four. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not eight but four games.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing some rows? Let me check all the 'location / attendance' entries:\n\n- Game 20: Boston Garden\n- Game 21: St Louis Arena\n- Game 22: Cincinnati\n- Game 23: New York, NY\n- Game 24: Boston Garden\n- Game 25: Boston Garden\n- Game 26: Boston Garden\n- Game 27: Detroit\n- Game 28: Boston Garden\n- Game 29: Baltimore\n- Game 30: Baltimore\n- Game 31: Baltimore\n- Game 32: Madison Square Garden\n- Game 33: Providence\n\nWait, I think I missed game 28. Let me check again.\n\nGame 28 is December 22nd vs NY Knicks at Boston Garden. So that's another game at Boston Garden on Dec 22. That's the fifth game there before December 17? Wait no, because December 22 is after December 17th. So it's not included in the games before December 17.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"all before december 17\". So any games after December 17 wouldn't count towards the eight. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the table, the dates are as follows for Boston Garden games:\n\n- Game 20: Dec 3\n- Game 24: Dec 8\n- Game 25: Dec 11\n- Game 26: Dec 15\n- Game 28: Dec 22\n\nSo only four of these (games 20,24,25,26) are before December 17. So four games, not eight.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there aren't eight games at Boston Garden before Dec 17th; it's actually four.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n]}",
