    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"toronto lose to cleveland on november 24 , 108 - 111 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Team1**: Toronto\n2. **Team2**: Cleveland\n3. **Date**: November 24\n4. **Score**: 108 - 111 (OT), which means an overtime loss for Toronto.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details like date, teams involved, score, etc.\n\nI'll need to find the relevant cells in the table that match these criteria.\n\nStarting with the date: November 24. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 13 has the date as november 24 and the opponent is cleveland.\n\nNext, checking the game outcome. The row for november 24 (row 13) shows that Toronto (team) played against Cleveland. The score column says l 108 - 111 (ot), which indicates a loss in overtime with the score of 108-111. This matches the claim's score and outcome.\n\nSo, the key cells are:\n\n- Row 13 (november 24)\n- Columns: game (but since it's a specific date, perhaps date is more relevant?), team, opponent, score.\n\nWait, the columns in the table include 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', etc. The claim mentions Toronto losing to Cleveland, so I need cells that show the opposing teams and the result.\n\nBut for the purposes of this check, the important columns are:\n\n- date: november 24\n- team: toronto (if it's listed as one of the teams in that row)\n- opponent: cleveland\n- score: 108 - 111 (ot)\n\nLooking back at row 13:\n\n- date: november 24\n- team: cleveland? Wait, no. Let me check the 'team' column for row 13.\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row has 'game' (a number), date, team (the home team?), opponent, etc. So in row 13:\n\n- game: 13\n- date: november 24\n- team: cleveland\n- score: l 108 - 111 (ot)\n- location attendance: quicken loans arena 20018\n\nWait, so if the claim is that Toronto lost to Cleveland, but in this row, the home team is Cleveland. So does that mean the opposing team is Toronto?\n\nYes, because in the 'opponent' column for row 13, it's not explicitly stated. Wait, no\u2014looking at the table:\n\nIn each row after 'date', there's a 'team' and then presumably the opponent, but looking at the columns provided, the 'team' is listed as, for example, new jersey in row 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the 'opponent' column. Wait, checking the table, I see that each row includes 'location attendance', which might not be the opponent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'team' and 'opponent' are separate fields. But looking at the markdown table provided:\n\nThe columns after game are date, team, score, etc., but I don't see an explicit 'opponent' column. So maybe the opponent is inferred as the other team than the home team.\n\nWait, in row 13, the 'team' is cleveland and the result is a loss for them? Wait, no: the score is l 108 - 111 (ot), which means Toronto scored 108 and lost to Cleveland who scored 111. So if the claim says Toronto lost to Cleveland, then this row would be relevant because it shows that on november 24, cleveland was the home team against toronto, with the score as claimed.\n\nWait, but in the table, row 13: team is cleveland, opponent would be toronto? Or is 'team' the home team?\n\nI think I need to clarify:\n\nIn sports leagues, usually, each game has a home and away team. The home team's details are listed first. So in row 13, the 'team' is cleveland, which would mean they were the home team, playing against toronto as the visitor.\n\nSo the claim says Toronto lost to Cleveland on that date with that score, which matches exactly what's in row 13: date november 24, score l 108 - 111 (ot), meaning Toronto (visitor) lost to Cleveland (home).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:13\n- column_name: date (to check the date)\n- column_name: team (cleveland is the home team, so toronto would be the opponent)\n- column_name: score (108 - 111 (ot))\n\nWait, but in the table, 'team' is cleveland. So does that mean the other team is toronto? Yes.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to check if on november 24, toronto played against cleveland and lost 108-111 in overtime.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. row_index:13 (november 24)\n2. column_name: date\n3. column_name: team (cleveland) and opponent (toronto), but since the table may not have an explicit opponent column, perhaps only the date is needed because the 'team' can indicate who was playing.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm that toronto lost, I need to look at the score and which team lost.\n\nIn row 13: the score is l 108 - 111 (ot), meaning the home team (cleveland) won. So if the claim is that toronto lost, then yes, because they were the away team.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:13\n- date\n- score\n\nSo in JSON, I need to list these as relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Toronto lost to Cleveland on November 24 with a score of 108-111 (OT). Checking the table, row 13 has the date november 24 and shows that Cleveland (home team) won against Toronto with the score l 108 - 111 (ot). Therefore, the relevant cells are the date and score in that row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is about a specific game: \"the result of the game on november 20 in dallas be w 110 - 101 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant row and column from the table that matches the claim. Let's go through the table step by step.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nThe claim mentions \"november 20\", so I need to find which row corresponds to that date. Scanning the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 2: november 2\n- Row 3: november 4\n- Row 4: november 6\n- Row 5: november 7\n- Row 6: november 9\n- Row 7: november 10\n- Row 8: november 14\n- Row 9: november 16\n- Row 10: november 18\n- Row 11: november 20\n\nAh, row 11 is november 20. So the relevant row is row 11.\n\nNow, within that row, let's check each column to see if it matches the claim.\n\nThe 'game' column for row 11 says \"dallas\", so that matches.\n\nLooking at the score: the claim mentions \"w 110 - 101 (ot)\". In the table, the 'score' column for row 11 is \"l 99 - 105 (ot)\". Wait, that's a loss, not a win. The claimed result is a win with a different score than what's shown in the table.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. The claim says it was a win by 110-101 in overtime, but according to the table, Dallas lost 99-105 on November 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the actual result was a loss, not a win, and the score doesn't match either.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game on November 20 in Dallas resulted in a win with a specific score. However, checking the table, Dallas actually lost that game with a different score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
