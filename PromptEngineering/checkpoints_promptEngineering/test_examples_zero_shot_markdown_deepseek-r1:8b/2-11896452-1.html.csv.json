    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the season that have a super g of 33 be 2008\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim refers to a season where the Super G category has a value of 33. Then it states that this should correspond to the year 2008.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there's a column called \"super g\" and another column called \"season\". Each row in the table corresponds to a specific season from 2005 onwards. \n\nI'll need to go through each row and check the value under the \"super g\" column for each year. The claim is specifically about Super G being 33, so I'm looking for rows where super g equals 33.\n\nLet me start checking each year one by one:\n\n- 2005: super g is 50 \u2192 not 33\n- 2006: super g is 45 \u2192 not 33\n- 2007: super g is - \u2192 missing, but that's a different issue\n- 2008: super g is 33 \u2192 this matches the value we're looking for.\n- 2009: super g is 30 \u2192 nope\n- 2010: super g is 9 \u2192 nope\n- 2011: super g is 27 \u2192 nope\n\nSo, in 2008, the Super G category has a value of 33. The claim says that this season is 2008, which matches perfectly.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if any other seasons have a super g of 33. From my scan above, only 2008 shows up as 33. So there's no confusion here; it's clear that the season with Super G 33 is indeed 2008.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because when you look at the table, 2008 has a super g value of 33.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim states: \"the super g value for the season that have an overall score of 16 be 9.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Super G Value**: Looking at the table, this corresponds to the column named \"super g.\"\n2. **Season with Overall Score of 16**: This refers to a particular season where the overall score is exactly 16.\n3. **Claim's Assertion**: In that specific season, the Super G value should be 9.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has headers: season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, combined. Each row represents a different season from 2005 to 2012.\n\nLet me go through each season:\n\n- **2005**: overall is 93, which doesn't match 16.\n- **2006**: overall is 77, nope.\n- **2007**: overall is 38, not 16.\n- **2008**: overall is 32, still not 16.\n- **2009**: overall is 25, no match.\n- **2010**: overall is 16. Here's the first potential candidate for our claim.\n\nIn 2010, let's check the \"super g\" column. The value listed is 9. That's exactly what the claim says\u20149 for that season. \n\nNext, I should check if there are any other seasons with an overall score of 16. Looking through all the years:\n\n- **2005 to 2012**: Only 2010 has an overall score of 16.\n\nSo, since only 2010 meets both criteria (overall=16 and super g=9), the claim holds true for that season.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. No other seasons meet the condition, so there's no ambiguity.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the Super G value for the season with an overall score of 16 (2010) is indeed 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the overall score for the 2006 season be 77\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the table: it has several columns like overall, slalom, super g, downhill, and combined. The rows represent different seasons from 2005 to 2012. Each cell in the table provides a score for each discipline or category per season.\n\nThe specific claim is about the \"overall\" score for the 2006 season. So I need to check if that's correct.\n\nLooking at the row corresponding to 2006, let me locate it. The first column under \"season\" is 2005, then 2006, and so on. Scanning down, the second row (row index 1) has the year 2006. Now, in that same row, I need to look at the \"overall\" column.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- For season 2006:\n  - Overall: 77\n  - Slalom: -\n  - Super g: 45\n  - Downhill: 29\n  - Combined: 40\n\nSo the overall score for 2006 is indeed 77. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other cells are relevant, but since the claim specifically refers to the \"overall\" score and the specific season (2006), those are the only two pieces of information needed.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because it correctly states that the overall score for the 2006 season was 77.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"the super g value for the season that have an overall score of 16 be 33.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. We're looking for a specific season where the 'overall' score is 16 and check if the 'super g' value is 33.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find where the 'overall' column has a value of 16. \n\nRow by row:\n\n- 2005: overall=93\n- 2006: overall=77\n- 2007: overall=38\n- 2008: overall=32\n- 2009: overall=25\n- 2010: overall=16 \u2192 This is the first season with an overall score of 16.\n- 2011: overall=60\n- 2012: overall is \"out for season...\" so not relevant.\n\nNow, focusing on the 2010 row. The 'super g' column for 2010 has a value of 9. The claim says it should be 33, but it's actually 9. Therefore, the statement isn't correct.\n\nSo, the answer is \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be:\n\n1. Row where overall=16: row_index=6 (since counting starts at 0 for 2005 as 0)\n2. Column 'super g': column name is 'super g'\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"super g\"}\n\nThat's all I need to provide.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"super g\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE and then find the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"2007 and 2008 both have a super g score of 33.\" So, I should look into the 'super g' column for the years 2007 and 2008. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a season from 2005 onwards. The columns are season, overall, slalom, super g, downhill, and combined.\n\nLet me locate the rows for 2007 and 2008.\n\nFor 2007 (row index 2), under 'super g', the value is \"-\", which likely means there was no competition or no data. For 2008 (row index 3), the 'super g' column also shows a \"-\". So, both years have \"-\" in their super g scores.\n\nWait, but the claim says that both have a super g score of 33. That doesn't match because neither 2007 nor 2008 has a score of 33; instead, they have a dash indicating perhaps no data or no event held that year.\n\nSo, based on this information, the claim is FALSE because the 'super g' scores for both 2007 and 2008 are \"-\", not 33. \n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. Since the claim refers to two specific years (2007 and 2008) and a specific column ('super g'), the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For 2007: row index 2, 'super g' column.\n- For 2008: row index 3, 'super g' column.\n\nThese are the only cells that directly relate to the claim. Therefore, these should be included in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because both 2007 and 2008 have \"-\" in their super g columns instead of 33.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"super g\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the downhill for 2006 be 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about the downhill performance in 2006 being 12. So, my focus should be on finding the value in the row corresponding to 2006 under the \"downhill\" column.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a season from 2005 to 2012. The columns are overall, slalom, super g, downhill, and combined. I need to check if there's any entry for downhill in 2006.\n\nI'll scan through the rows:\n\n- 2005: Downhill is 37.\n- 2006: The overall is 77, but I'm looking specifically for downhill. In 2006, under \"downhill,\" it shows 29.\nWait, that's conflicting with the claim. Wait no, the claim says \"the downhill for 2006 be 12.\" But in the table, for 2006, downhill is 29, not 12.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me double-check. Oh no, looking again: \n\nIn the table, each season's row lists five columns: overall, slalom, super g, downhill, and combined. For 2006, the \"overall\" column is 77, then slalom is \"-\", super g is 45, downhill is 29, and combined is 40.\n\nSo for 2006, the downhill entry is indeed 29, not 12. Therefore, the claim that the downhill in 2006 was 12 is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe there's a mistake in the table or perhaps I'm misreading something. Let me check each row again carefully.\n\nLooking at 2012, it says \"out for season : injured in january 2011\" across all columns except overall, but that's for 2012, which is beyond the claim's scope. So no issue there.\n\nSo, focusing on 2006: the downhill column has a value of 29, not 12. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the table shows that in 2006, the downhill result was 29, not 12.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"downhill\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
