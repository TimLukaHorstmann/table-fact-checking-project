    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"player gil morgan represents the united state tie for 7th place with -2 to par.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate where Gil Morgan is in the table. Looking at the 'player' column, I see that there's a row for Gil Morgan. Let me check the row index. Scanning through, it looks like he's in row 9 because the players are listed as tom watson, ken brown, lee trevino, ben crenshaw, andy bean, hubert green, isao aoki, sandy lyle, carl mason, gil morgan, and jack nicklaus, craig stadler. Wait, actually, counting each row: 1, t2, t2,4,t5,t5,t7,t7,t7,t7,t7. So the actual numbered rows start at 1 for tom watson (row 0 if we count from 0). Then, the 10th player is gil morgan in row index 9.\n\nNext, I need to check his country. The claim says \"united state,\" and looking at the table, yes, Gil Morgan's country is united states. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, the place: the claim mentions tie for 7th place. Looking at the 'place' column, most entries are like t2, t4, etc., which I think stands for tied for 2nd, 4th, etc. For Gil Morgan, his place is listed as t7, meaning he's tied for 7th place. So that matches the claim.\n\nThen, the score: The table shows each player's score as sum of three numbers. For Gil Morgan, it's 70 + 70 + 71 = 211. The to par column says -2. That seems correct because 211 is the total, and the to par is indeed -2. So his performance aligns with the claim.\n\nPutting it all together: Gil Morgan is from the United States, tied for 7th place, with a score of 211 and -2 to par. The claim matches all these aspects.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table as each condition checks out correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
