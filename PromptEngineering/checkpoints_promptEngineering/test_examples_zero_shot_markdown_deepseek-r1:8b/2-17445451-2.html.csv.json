    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the match with opponent cleber luciano last 7:57\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a match where the opponent is Cleber Luciano and that it ended at 7:57. Looking at the table provided, I should search for any matches involving Cleber Luciano.\n\nI'll start by scanning the 'opponent' column in the table to see who has fought against Cleber. The opponents listed are john cox, flavio troccoli, din thomas, caol uno, phil johns, daiju takase, laverne clark, danny bennett, dave menne, frank trigg, and cleber luciano.\n\nWait, there's a row where the opponent is Cleber Luciano. Let me check that entry. The relevant row seems to be near the end of the table. Scanning each row:\n\n1. win vs john cox\n2. win vs flavio troccoli\n3. loss vs din thomas\n4. loss vs caol uno\n5. win vs phil johns\n6. win vs daiju takase\n7. win vs laverne clark\n8. win vs danny bennett\n9. loss vs dave menne\n10. loss vs frank trigg\n11. loss vs laverne clark\n12. win vs Cleber Luciano\n\nYes, row 12 has the opponent as Cleber Luciano. Now, let's check the other details. The claim says \"last 7:57\". So, I need to see if this match ended at 7:57.\n\nLooking at the 'time' column for Cleber Luciano's fight, it shows 7:57 in the 'time' cell of row 12. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nAdditionally, the event is listed as \"ec 22 - extreme challenge 22\", which isn't necessary for this specific claim, but it confirms that it's a valid match.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table: there is a match against Cleber Luciano, and it ended at 7:57. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions.\n\nThe claim is: \"tko (cut) be the method in round 1 of the ufc 20 event.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components:\n\n- The method is \"tko (cut).\"\n- The event is \"ufc 20.\"\n- The round is \"round 1.\"\n\nSo, I need to find in the table a record where:\n1. The event is \"ufc 20.\"\n2. The round is \"1.\"\n3. The method used is \"tko (cut).\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like res (win/loss), record, opponent, method, event, round, and time.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: win, 9-5, john cox, ko, lip 1 - lockdown in paradise 1. Not relevant.\n\nRow 1: win, 8-5, flavio troccoli, submission (armbar), hfp 2 - hitman fighting productions 2. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: loss, 7-5, din thomas, decision (unanimous), ufc 33. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: loss, 7-4, caol uno, ko (punches), ufc 32. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: win, 7-3, phil johns, submission (armbar), ufc 30. Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: win, 6-3, daiju takase, tko (strikes), ufc 29. Not relevant for method.\n\nRow 6: win, 5-3, laverne clark, submission (armbar), ufc 27. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: win, 4-3, danny bennett, submission (armbar), kotc 4 - gladiators. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: loss, 3-3, dave menne, decision, ufc 24. Not relevant.\n\nRow 9: loss, 3-2, frank trigg, tko (strikes), pride 8. Method is tko but event is pride 8, not ufc 20.\n\nRow 10: loss, 3-1, laverne clark, tko (cut), ufc 20. Here's the relevant row. The method is \"tko (cut)\", event is \"ufc 20\", and round is \"1.\"\n\nSo, this row matches all three criteria of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row_index 10, column_name \"method\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the UFC 20 event is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the ufc 20 eveny end with a method of decision (unanimus).\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any entries related to UFC 20. Scanning each row's 'event' column:\n\n- Row 0: lip 1 - lockdown in paradise 1\n- Row 1: hfp 2 - hitman fighting productions 2\n- Row 2: ufc 33\n- Row 3: ufc 32\n- Row 4: ufc 30\n- Row 5: ufc 29\n- Row 6: ufc 27\n- Row 7: kotc 4 - gladiators\n- Row 8: ufc 24\n- Row 9: pride 8\n- Row 10: ufc 20\n- Row 11: ec 22 - extreme challenge 22\n- Row 12: ng 5 - neutral grounds 5\n\nSo, the UFC 20 event is in row 10. Now, I need to check what the method was for that fight.\n\nLooking at row 10's 'method' column: it says \"tko (cut).\" That doesn't match the claim of a decision (unanimus). \n\nAdditionally, I should ensure there are no other rows related to UFC 20 with different methods. Since only row 10 refers to UFC 20 and its method is tko, not a decision, the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
