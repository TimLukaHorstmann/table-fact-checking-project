    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the total attendance on may 28 be 17132\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and understand what each column represents. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. The claim specifically mentions \"attendance,\" so my main focus will be on that column.\n\nThe claim is about May 28. So I need to find the row where the date is May 28. Let me scan through the rows:\n\n1. May 24: visitor Pittsburgh, home Detroit\n2. May 26: same as above\n3. May 28: visitor Detroit, home Pittsburgh\n4. May 31: same as above but reversed\n5. June 2 and 4 follow.\n\nLooking at row index 2 (since rows are zero-indexed? Wait, the first row is index 0, so May 24 is row 0, May 26 is row 1, May 28 is row 2, etc.\n\nSo in row 2, the date is May 28. Now I need to check the attendance for that row. According to the table, attendance is 17132. The claim says it's 17132, so that matches.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other relevant columns or rows. The claim is specifically about attendance on May 28, so only the attendance column in that row matters. So the relevant cells would be the attendance value for May 28, which is 17132.\n\nSo I think the answer should be TRUE because the attendance figure matches. Now, to structure the response correctly, I need to list all the relevant cells as specified. Since the claim only concerns the attendance on May 28, that's the only cell needed in relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that on May 28, the attendance was indeed 17132. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the attendance on may 28 be lower than the attendance on may 31.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The key here is the date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series columns. For the attendance comparison, I'm looking at two dates: May 28 and May 31.\n\nLooking at the table, May 28 is in row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed; rows are 0,1,2,3,4,5). The corresponding cell for attendance on that day is 17132. Then May 31 is row index 3 with an attendance of 17132 as well.\n\nWait, both attendances are the same\u201417,132. So, comparing them: Is May 28's attendance lower than May 31's? Since they're equal, it's not lower. Therefore, the claim isn't true because neither is strictly lower; they're the same. \n\nI should make sure I'm looking at the correct columns and rows. Attendance is the fifth column from the right, which is \"attendance\". So in row 2 (May 28), attendance is 17132, and in row 3 (May 31), it's also 17132.\n\nSo, the claim says May 28 has lower attendance than May 31. But since both are equal, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the attendance on May 28 was lower than on May 31, we first identify the relevant cells from the table. May 28 corresponds to row index 2 and column \"attendance\" with a value of 17,132. May 31 is in row index 3 with the same attendance value. Since both attendances are equal, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20066.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what this claim is saying. It's talking about matches where the home team has a score of 0-4 and the visitor's score is 0-4 as well? Wait, no, the score is in the format \"home - away\" or \"visitor - home\"? Looking at the table, I see entries like \"pittsburgh | 0 - 4 | detroit\". So, probably the first team is the visitor, and the second is the home. Because for example, on May 24, Pittsburgh has 0-4 against Detroit.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, series. So, the 'visitor' column lists the away team? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nIn sports terminology, usually, the 'visitor' would be the away team. So in a match, you have the home team and the visitor (away). The score is given as \"home - visitor\" or \"visitor - home\"? Looking at the table, for example, on May 24: pittsburgh is the visitor with a score of 0-4 against detroit. So does that mean pittsburgh scored 0, and detroit scored 4? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, looking at another row, like June 2: pittsburgh has a score of 4-3 against detroit. If pittsburgh is the visitor again, then their score would be away goals, and the home team's score is on the other side. So in May 24, pittsburgh (visitor) scored 0, detroit (home) scored 4.\n\nSo when the claim says \"a match with a score of 0-4\", that would mean that the visitor has 0 points away and the home team has 4. But wait, in the table, the 'score' column shows things like \"0 - 4\". So I need to figure out whether this is home score minus visitor or vice versa.\n\nWait, on May 24: visitor is pittsburgh with 0-4, home is detroit. If that's the case, then the score could be either way depending on which team is which. But perhaps in the context of the table, the first number represents the visitor's score, and the second is the home's score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me look at another example. On June 2: pittsburgh (visitor) has a score of 4-3 against detroit (home). So if pittsburgh scored 4, then their away goals are 4, and detroit scored 3 at home. That would make sense because the home team usually scores in front of their crowd, so higher attendance might be expected when the home team is performing better.\n\nWait, but the claim is about matches with a score of 0-4, which is pretty lopsided. So I need to find all matches where the score is 0-4 and identify the highest attendance for those matches.\n\nSo first step: identify all rows where the 'score' column is \"0 - 4\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. May 24: pittsburgh (visitor) vs detroit (home). Score: 0-4.\n2. May 26: pittsburgh (visitor) vs detroit (home). Score: 0-3.\n3. May 28: detroit (visitor) vs pittsburgh (home). Score: 2-3.\n4. May 31: detroit (visitor) vs pittsburgh (home). Score: 2-1.\n5. June 2: pittsburgh (visitor) vs detroit (home). Score: 4-3.\n6. June 4: detroit (visitor) vs pittsburgh (home). Score: 3-2.\n\nSo only the first two rows have scores that start with a lower number, but none of them are exactly 0-4 except May 24 and May 26. Wait, no: May 24 is 0-4, May 26 is 0-3. So in the table, there's one match where the score is exactly 0-4 on May 24.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\nMay 24: pittsburgh | 0 - 4 | detroit. So score is 0-4.\nMay 26: pittsburgh | 0 - 3 | detroit. Score is 0-3.\nMay 28: detroit | 2 - 3 | pittsburgh. So that's 2-3, which isn't 0-4.\nMay 31: detroit | 2 - 1 | pittsburgh. 2-1, not 0-4.\nJune 2: pittsburgh | 4 - 3 | detroit. 4-3.\nJune 4: detroit | 3 - 2 | pittsburgh. 3-2.\n\nSo only May 24 has a score of 0-4. So that's the only match where the score is exactly 0-4.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20066.\" So we need to check if in all matches with a score of 0-4, the maximum attendance is 20066.\n\nBut from the table, only May 24 has a score of 0-4, and its attendance is 20066. So that's the only match in question.\n\nTherefore, since there's only one match with a 0-4 score, and its attendance is exactly 20066, the claim is TRUE because it's the highest (and only) attendance for such matches.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: are there any other matches where the score is 0-4? The next closest is May 26 with 0-3, which isn't a 0-4. So yes, only May 24 has a score of 0-4 with attendance 20066.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0-4 is 20066. From the table, there's only one match with this exact score (May 24), and its attendance matches 20066. Since there are no other such matches, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the total lowest attendance with a score of 4 - 2 be higher than 20066.\" \n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It mentions two things: \n1. The \"lowest attendance\" associated with a game that has a score of 4 - 2.\n2. This lowest attendance should be higher than 20066.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. \n\nI need to find all rows where the score is 4 - 2 because that's a key part of the claim. So I'll scan through each row:\n\n- May 24: Score is 0 - 4 \u2192 not relevant.\n- May 26: Score is 0 - 3 \u2192 not relevant.\n- May 28: Score is 2 - 3 \u2192 not relevant.\n- May 31: Score is 2 - 1 \u2192 not relevant.\n- June 2: Score is 4 - 3 \u2192 close, but not 4 - 2.\n- June 4: Score is 3 - 2 \u2192 not relevant.\n\nWait, none of the rows have a score of exactly 4 - 2. That's interesting because the claim references such a score. If there are no games with a score of 4 - 2 in the table, then there can't be any attendance figures associated with that specific score.\n\nSo, since there are no relevant rows with a 4 - 2 score, the lowest attendance for such a game doesn't exist or is zero in this context. Therefore, it's impossible for the lowest attendance to be higher than 20066 because there are no such games to consider.\n\nThis means the claim is based on an incorrect premise\u2014assuming that a game with a 4 - 2 score exists in the table. Since that's not the case, the claim doesn't hold true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a non-existent game (with a score of 4-2) in the table, making it impossible for its attendance to exceed 20066.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
