    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"round 18, all events take place on 26 August 1961 Victorian Football League.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows, each representing a different game.\n\nThe key points from the claim are:\n1. All events (games) in round 18 of the Victorian Football League took place on 26 August 1961.\n2. Each row in the table corresponds to a game for that round.\n\nSo, I need to verify two things: whether all games listed are part of Round 18 and whether they all occurred on 26 August 1961.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column, every entry is \"26 august 1961.\" That means all the games in the table took place on that specific date. \n\nNext, I need to check if these games were indeed part of Round 18. The table doesn't explicitly mention the round number, but considering it's a Victorian Football League (VFL) match, and the dates are concentrated in August 1961, it's likely that these games are from Round 18.\n\nSince all the necessary information about the date is provided and there's no conflicting data indicating different rounds or dates, I can conclude that the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the 1961 Victorian football league season be the 65th season of the elite Australian rule football competition.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the 1961 Victorian Football League (VFL) season was the 65th season of the elite Australian rule football competition. So, my task is to check if this statement aligns with the information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several matches from August 26, 1961. The home and away teams include various Victorian clubs like Carlton, St Kilda, Essendon, Richmond, Fitzroy, Melbourne, Hawthorn, Collingwood, North Melbourne, South Melbourne, and Geelong. The venues are also listed as various ovals in Victoria.\n\nNow, to verify the claim, I need to confirm two main points:\n1. Whether 1961 was indeed the 65th season of the elite Australian rule football competition.\n2. Whether this competition is correctly identified as the Victorian Football League (VFL) or another.\n\nFrom my general knowledge, the VFL (Victorian Football League) was a prominent Australian rules football competition that operated from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It's often considered one of the precursor competitions to what became the AFL (Australian Football League) in the 1990s. The VFL had several clubs based in Victoria, which matches the teams listed in the table.\n\nNow, focusing on the season number: if the claim is that 1961 was the 65th season, I need to check historical records or reliable sources about the VFL's season history. However, without specific data here, I can't confirm the exact count, but based on the context of the table being from 1961, it's plausible.\n\nBut wait, the term \"elite Australian rule football competition\" might refer to the AFL (Australian Football League), which started in 1995. The VFL existed earlier but wasn't the same as the AFL. So, if the claim is about the 65th season of an elite competition, and considering that the AFL started much later, this could be a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"elite\" refers to the top-tier competition at that time, which was the VFL. But it's important to note that the VFL didn't have a direct 1st to 15th grading as the AFL does now.\n\nLooking back at the table, all the teams are Victorian-based, and the venues are within Victoria, which aligns with the VFL being a Victorian competition. The dates in the table are August 26, 1961, which matches known historical data for VFL seasons.\n\nGiven that, it's reasonable to infer that the 1961 season was part of the VFL, and if the VFL had been around since 1897 (its foundation), then by 1961, it would have had multiple seasons. Calculating the exact number is tricky without the table's specific context, but considering the information at hand, the claim seems plausible.\n\nHowever, the term \"elite\" might be misleading because the VFL was not the same as the AFL. The AFL was established later to professionalize the game and unify the competition across Australia, not just Victoria. So, if the claim is about the 65th season of an elite competition that includes both Victorian and other Australian teams, it wouldn't apply to the VFL.\n\nWait, but in 1961, the VFL was still a Victorian-based competition without teams from other states, so it couldn't have been the same as the AFL which later included all Australian states. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because the VFL wasn't an elite competition covering all of Australia at that time.\n\nBut then again, if \"elite\" refers to the top-tier within Victoria, perhaps it's correct. This is a bit confusing. Without specific historical data on the season numbering, I can't be certain, but based on the information given in the table and the context, the claim might not hold because the VFL wasn't the same as the later AFL.\n\nAlternatively, if the competition was known by another name or structure that aligns with the claim, it could be TRUE. But considering that the AFL started in 1995, it's unlikely that a season from 1961 would refer to an elite competition that exists today.\n\nTherefore, after this analysis, I think the claim is FALSE because the VFL was a different competition and the term \"elite\" might not accurately describe it in the context of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the highest crowd during the round 18 be between the home team footscray and away team of geelong.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's in markdown format with several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The row index starts from 0. Each row represents a different match on August 26, 1961.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Round 18 and mentions the highest crowd between Footscray (home) and Geelong (away). So I need to find in the table where Footscray is the home team playing against Geelong as the away team. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first row: Home team is Footscray, away team is Geelong.\n- The second row: Home team Fitzroy vs South Melbourne.\n- Third: Carlton vs Melbourne.\n- Fourth: St Kilda vs North Melbourne.\n- Fifth: Richmond vs Hawthorn.\n- Sixth: Essendon vs Collingwood.\n\nSo only the first row matches the claim's description. Now, I need to check the crowd number for that match. The 'crowd' column for Footscray vs Geelong is 42015, which seems quite high compared to others on that day.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the highest crowd,\" but since it's Round 18 and only one match in the table, we can assume this is the highest. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row index is 0 for Footscray vs Geelong, so that's row 0. The columns involved are 'home team' (since Footscray is home) and 'away team' (Geelong). Also, the crowd column is important.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- Row 0: 'crowd' to check the number.\n- Additionally, maybe 'venue'? Not sure if needed, but according to instructions, any relevant columns. But since the claim is about home and away teams, perhaps those are the main ones.\n\nWait, the user's example includes columns like Revenue and Employees, which might not be directly tied to the claim. In this case, the claim mentions specific team names, so I think 'home team' and 'away team' are relevant. Plus, the crowd column is definitely relevant for verification.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would include:\n- Row 0: columns \"crowd\", \"home team\", \"away team\".\n\nThat makes sense because we need to confirm that Footscray and Geelong played against each other with a high crowd.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"brunswick street oval be the venue with the least amount of crowd.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. They're saying that Brunswick Street Oval has the smallest number of people attending it among all the venues listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, and crowd. My focus is on the \"crowd\" column because the claim is about the number of attendees. \n\nI need to find out which row corresponds to Brunswick Street Oval. Scanning down, I see that the third row has the venue \"brunswick street oval.\" Wait, no, actually, looking again: the second row is fitzroy vs south melbourne at brunswick street oval with a crowd of 12815.\n\nNow, I'll extract all the crowd numbers for each venue to compare. Let me list them out:\n\n- Western Oval: 42015\n- Brunswick Street Oval: 12815\n- Princes Park: 21863\n- Junction Oval: 24250\n- Punt Road Oval: 15177\n- Windy Hill: 18500\n\nI need to find the smallest crowd number here. Let's list them numerically:\n\n- 12815 (Brunswick Street Oval)\n- 15177 (Punt Road Oval)\n- 18500 (Windy Hill)\n- 21863 (Princes Park)\n- 24250 (Junction Oval)\n- 42015 (Western Oval)\n\nSo, the smallest is 12815, which corresponds to Brunswick Street Oval. Therefore, the claim is correct because it does have the least crowd compared to all other venues in the table.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The venue column for each row has the name of the location. So for each row, the \"crowd\" column's value must be checked, and specifically, the row where venue is \"brunswick street oval.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cell is the one where row_index is 1 (since it's zero-indexed) and the column is \"crowd.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Brunswick Street Oval has the lowest crowd number among all venues listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"Between the home team Essendon and away team Collingwood, the away team have a higher score than the home team.\" I need to check if this is true by looking at the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the home team is Essendon and the away team is Collingwood. Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Home team: footscray vs geelong\n2. **Row 1:** Home team: fitzroy vs south melbourne\n3. **Row 2:** Home team: carlton vs melbourne\n4. **Row 3:** Home team: st kilda vs north melbourne\n5. **Row 4:** Home team: richmond vs hawthorn\n6. **Row 5:** Home team: essendon vs collingwood\n\nAh, here's the relevant row, which is Row 5. Now, I need to check the scores for both teams in this match.\n\nLooking at the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns under Essendon (home) and Collingwood (away):\n\n- **Essendon's score:** 12.16 (88)\n- **Collingwood's score:** 13.10 (88)\n\nSo, both teams scored 88 points each. The claim says that the away team (Collingwood) has a higher score than the home team (Essendon). However, in this case, their scores are equal.\n\nSince Collingwood doesn't have a higher score than Essendon, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells for verification. The relevant row is Row 5, and within that row, the columns we need to check are \"home team score\" and \"away team score\". Therefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For Essendon (home), the column is \"home team score\", which is at row_index 5.\n- For Collingwood (away), the column is \"away team score\", also at row_index 5.\n\nSo, I should list both of these as relevant cells in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because both teams scored equal points.

I need to determine if the given claim about the 1961 Victorian Football League season is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the 1961 Victorian football league season be the 65th season of the elite Australian rule football competition but all the team be from the united state.\" \n\nBreaking this down, there are two main points here. The first part states that the 1961 season was the 65th season, and the second part mentions that \"all the teams be from the United States.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game between a home team and an away team with their respective scores, venue, crowd size, and date. The 'date' column shows \"26 august 1961,\" which aligns with the claim's reference to the 1961 season.\n\nNow, checking if all teams are from the United States: The table lists several teams such as Footscray, Fitzroy, Carlton, St Kilda, Richmond, and Essendon. All these names sound like Australian rules football clubs, not American. So the second part of the claim seems incorrect because these teams are indeed from Australia, not the United States.\n\nNext, I need to verify if it's the 65th season. Since I don't have historical data on each season before 1961, but given that the claim is about the 65th season, and assuming it's correct based on historical records, that part might hold true.\n\nHowever, since one of the claims is false (teams from the US), the overall statement isn't entirely TRUE. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" \n\nNow, identifying which cells are relevant: The 'date' column is essential to confirm the season's year, so I'll include that. Additionally, each team's name might be important if verifying their origin, but since all seem to be Australian, I don't need to highlight them unless it's necessary. But given the claim refers to the teams being from the US, perhaps each team's row is relevant for checking their origin.\n\nWait, no. Since all teams are indeed from Australia, highlighting their rows might not add value because the claim is incorrect on that point regardless of individual cells. However, since the 'date' confirms the year, it's relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be each team's row (since they're all in Australia) and the date column to confirm the 1961 aspect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table seems to list games from August 26, 1961. I'm assuming this might be related to a specific round, but I don't know if all these games are from round 18 or not. That's something to check.\n\nNext, the claim states that all events took place on 26 August 1961. Looking at the table, every game listed has that date, so that part seems correct.\n\nThen, it says all events occurred at the Western Oval venue and nowhere else. So I need to verify if all games were played there or not.

The claim states: \"the highest crowd during the round 18 be between the home team footscray and the away team geelong with the number of crowd be the same number as when richmond play hawthorn.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check each condition against the table.\n\n1. **Highest Crowd in Round 18**: The claim mentions that the highest crowd is between Footscray (home) and Geelong (away). So, I need to find which row corresponds to Round 18 for these two teams. Looking at the 'date' column might help because all entries are on 26 August 1961, but it's unclear what rounds those games were in. Wait, the table doesn't specify the round number. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the round, I can't confirm if this is Round 18 or another round. Maybe the claim assumes that all these games are in Round 18? Or perhaps the highest crowd on that specific date (26 August) is considered as Round 18. If that's the case, then I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\n2. **Crowd Numbers**: The claim says the number of crowd between Footscray and Geelong should be the same as when Richmond plays Hawthorn. So, I need to find the crowd numbers for both matches and see if they match.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Footscray vs Geelong: Crowd is 42015.\n- Richmond vs Hawthorn: Let's find their game in the table. Scanning the home teams, Richmond is one of them, so their away team is Hawthorn. The crowd for that game is 15177.\n\nSo, are 42015 and 15177 the same? No, they're different numbers. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me check again. Footscray vs Geelong: home team Footscray has a crowd of 42015. Richmond vs Hawthorn (Richmond's game) has a crowd of 15177. These are not equal. So the number of crowd isn't the same for both matches.\n\nAdditionally, I need to confirm that these games were indeed in Round 18. Since the table doesn't specify rounds, maybe the claim is incorrect in another aspect too. But since the crowd numbers don't match, regardless of the round, the claim fails on the crowd number condition.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The highest crowd might be between Footscray and Geelong, but the crowd count isn't equal to Richmond vs Hawthorn's crowd. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "brunswick street oval be the venue with the least amount of crowd and it be when essendon play collingwood",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding both the problem and the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"Brunswick Street Oval be the venue with the least amount of crowd and it be when Essendon play Collingwood.\" So, I need to check two things here: first, whether Brunswick Street Oval is indeed the venue with the least crowd, and second, whether this game between Essendon and Collingwood occurred at that venue.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. The columns are home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows correspond to Essendon playing against Collingwood. Scanning through the 'home team' column, I see that Essendon is listed as the home team in one row. Specifically, it's the sixth row (row_index 5) where Essendon has a score of 12.16 (88), and they're playing against Collingwood who scored 13.10 (88). The venue for this match is Windy Hill with a crowd of 18,500.\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the claim because the claim mentions Brunswick Street Oval as the venue, but in the table, Essendon vs. Collingwood is at Windy Hill. So that already raises a red flag. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLooking again: the home team for this match is Essendon, and the away team is Collingwood. The venue is Windy Hill. So the claim is incorrect in stating that it's at Brunswick Street Oval because that's a different venue.\n\nNow, regarding the crowd size: the claim says \"Brunswick Street Oval be the venue with the least amount of crowd.\" I need to check all matches played at Brunswick Street Oval and see if they indeed have the lowest crowd compared to other venues in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Footscray vs. Geelong: Venue is Western Oval, crowd 42,015.\n- Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne: Venue is Brunswick Street Oval, crowd 12,815.\n- Carlton vs. Melbourne: Venue is Princes Park, crowd 21,863.\n- St Kilda vs. North Melbourne: Venue is Junction Oval, crowd 24,250.\n- Richmond vs. Hawthorn: Venue is Punt Road Oval, crowd 15,177.\n- Essendon vs. Collingwood: Venue is Windy Hill, crowd 18,500.\n\nSo only one match is at Brunswick Street Oval: Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne with a crowd of 12,815. Now, comparing this to other venues:\n\nWestern Oval had 42k, Princes Park 21k, Junction Oval 24k, Punt Road Oval 15k, and Windy Hill 18.5k.\n\nSo the lowest crowd is at Brunswick Street Oval (12,815). Therefore, the first part of the claim is true\u2014Brunswick Street Oval has the least crowd among the listed venues.\n\nHowever, the second part says that this happens when Essendon plays Collingwood. But in the table, Essendon vs. Collingwood occurs at Windy Hill, not Brunswick Street Oval. So the match between Essendon and Collingwood isn't at the venue with the least crowd.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes the Essendon-Collingwood game to being played at Brunswick Street Oval, which isn't the case.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that all possible matches are considered. Are there any other matches between Essendon and Collingwood in the table? Let me check:\n\nLooking through each row's away team: Geelong, South Melbourne, Melbourne, North Melbourne, Hawthorn, Collingwood.\n\nSo only one match where Collingwood is the away team (Essendon vs. Collingwood). There are no other matches involving Essendon and Collingwood in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it's incorrectly associating the least crowd venue with the wrong game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because while Brunswick Street Oval does have the lowest crowd count, the Essendon vs. Collingwood match occurred at Windy Hill, not there. Hence, the association in the claim is flawed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"When the home team is Essendon and the away team is Collingwood, Essendon has the highest points with 25.29 (179) and Collingwood has the lowest with 8.15 (63).\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided to find the relevant rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the table headers: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nThe claim is about two specific teams: Essendon as the home team and Collingwood as the away team. So, I need to look for the row where home team is Essendon and away team is Collingwood.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is Footscray, so no.\n- Row 1: Fitroy vs South Melbourne; not our teams.\n- Row 2: Carlton vs Melbourne; no.\n- Row 3: St Kilda vs North Melbourne; no.\n- Row 4: Richmond vs Hawthorn; no.\n- Row 5: Essendon vs Collingwood. Yes, this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, check the scores for Essendon and Collingwood in this row.\n\nEssendon's score is 12.16 (88), and Collingwood's score is 13.10 (88). Wait, that doesn't make sense because according to the claim, Essendon should have the highest points at 25.29 (179), but in reality, they have 12.16 (88).\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the table. Oh no, row 1 is Fitroy vs South Melbourne, and row 5 is Essendon vs Collingwood.\n\nWait, in row 5: home team is Essendon with a score of 12.16 (88), and away team is Collingwood with a score of 13.10 (88). So both teams have the same score of 88 points. That's interesting because the claim says Essendon has the highest and Collingwood the lowest, but here their scores are equal, not high or low.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check again. In row 5, the home team is Essendon with a score of 12.16 (88), and away team is Collingwood with 13.10 (88). So both have the same points, but the claim says Essendon has 25.29 (179) which I don't see in the table.\n\nWait, no, the table doesn't show 25.29 for Essendon. The highest score I can see is 25.29 for Fitroy in row 1, but that's not Essendon. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nSo, according to the table, when Essendon plays Collingwood at home, Essendon scored 12.16 (88) and Collingwood scored 13.10 (88). Therefore, both teams have equal points, which contradicts the claim that Essendon has the highest with 179 points and Collingwood the lowest with 63.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because row 1 is Fitroy vs South Melbourne, not Essendon vs Collingwood. So in the table, Essendon is playing Collingwood on August 26, 1961 at Windy Hill, with Essendon scoring 12.16 and Collingwood 13.10.\n\nTherefore, the claim's numbers don't match the table because it shows Essendon scored 88 points, not 179, which is much lower. Also, Collingwood didn't score 63 but 88 as well. So the claim's assertion about their scores being 179 and 63 is incorrect.\n\nSo the claim is false because in reality, Essendon did not have the highest score (they had a lower score) and Collingwood also didn't have the lowest; they tied with Essendon.\n\nWait, but I think there might be a mistake here. Let me check again. The table shows that on 26 August 1961, Essendon played Collingwood at Windy Hill. Essendon's score was 12.16 (88), and Collingwood scored 13.10 (88). So both have the same points.\n\nThus, the claim that Essendon has the highest with 25.29 (179) is incorrect because they only scored 88 in this game. Also, Collingwood didn't score 63; their score was 88 as well.\n\nSo, the claim's assertion about the scores doesn't align with the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because, according to the table, Essendon and Collingwood both scored 88 points when they played each other. The claim incorrectly states Essendon's score as much higher than Collingwood's, which isn't supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
