    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"Yani Tseng be the runner up in 2008 and become the champion in 2010 and 2011.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: \n1. Was Yani Tseng the runner-up in 2008?\n2. Did she become the champion in both 2010 and 2011?\n\nStarting with the first part, I need to look at the year 2008 in the table. Looking through the table, I see that in 2008 (row index 7), the champion was Jiyai Shin. The runner-up column lists \"Yani Tseng.\" So yes, she was the runner-up in 2008.\n\nNext, for the second part of the claim, I need to check if Yani Tseng was the champion in both 2010 and 2011. Looking at the rows for these years:\n- In 2010 (row index 4), the champion is \"Yani Tseng.\"\n- In 2011 (row index 2), the champion is also \"Yani Tseng.\"\n\nSo she was indeed the champion in both those years.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant. For each of these points, I should note the row index and the column name.\n\nFor 2008: runner-up is \"Yani Tseng\" in the runner (s) - up column at row index 7.\nFor 2010 and 2011: champions are \"Yani Tseng\" in the champion column at rows 4 and 2, respectively.\n\nSo compiling all relevant cells:\n- Row 7, column \"runner (s) - up\"\n- Row 4, column \"champion\"\n- Row 2, column \"champion\"\n\nI think that covers both parts of the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"annika s\u00f6renstam and yani tseng win with the lowest number of stroke\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that both Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng have the lowest number of strokes in their respective years. So, for each occurrence where either of them won, I should check if they indeed had the lowest stroke count compared to other winners in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year with various details like dates, venue, champion, country, score, to par, margin of victory, runners-up, purse, and winner's share. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"champion\" and \"score\", specifically looking at the stroke count.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n1. **2013**: Champion is Stacy Lewis with a score of 280. Neither Annika nor Yani won here.\n2. **2012**: Champion is Jiyai Shin with 279 strokes. Not relevant.\n3. **2011**: Champion is Yani Tseng, who scored 272. The claim is about both Annika and Yani winning low strokes, so this is relevant.\n4. **2010**: Champion is Yani Tseng again with 277 strokes. Relevant.\n5. **2009**: Champion is Catriona Matthew with 285 strokes. Not relevant.\n6. **2008**: Champion is Jiyai Shin with 270 strokes. Not relevant.\n7. **2007**: Champion is Lorena Ochoa with 287 strokes. Not relevant.\n8. **2006**: Champion is Sherri Steinhauer with 281 strokes. Not relevant.\n9. **2005**: Champion is Jeong Jang with 272 strokes. Not relevant.\n10. **2004**: Champion is Karen Stupples with 269 strokes. Not relevant.\n11. **2003**: Champion is Annika S\u00f6renstam with 278 strokes. Relevant.\n12. **2002**: Champion is Karrie Webb with 273 strokes. Not relevant.\n13. **2001**: Champion is Se Ri Pak with 277 strokes. Not relevant.\n\nNow, focusing on the years where either Annika or Yani won:\n\n- **2011**: Yani Tseng had 272 strokes. Check if this is the lowest in that year. Looking at other champions for 2011, Stacy Lewis had 280 and Jiyai Shin had 279. So 272 is indeed lower than both, making it the lowest.\n\n- **2003**: Annika S\u00f6renstam scored 278 strokes. Comparing to others like Catriona Matthew (285), Karen Stupples (269), etc., 278 might not be the absolute lowest. Wait, in 2011, she had a lower score of 272, so perhaps I need to check if 278 is indeed the lowest for that year. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the table again, in 2003, Annika's score was 278. The next closest is Karen Stupples in 2004 with 269, but since 269 is lower than 278, does that mean Annika didn't have the lowest? Wait, no, because each year's data is separate. So for 2003, we need to check if any other champion had a lower score. Looking at other champions in different years doesn't help; I should only compare within the same year.\n\nWait, no. In 2003, Annika was the champion with 278 strokes. The other champions like Karen Stupples in 2004 have their own scores, but that's irrelevant for 2003. So within 2003, was 278 the lowest? Let me check the table:\n\nIn 2003, the champion is Annika S\u00f6renstam with 278. No one else won that year, so it's the only score for that year. Therefore, it's the lowest by default.\n\nBut wait, the claim says both Annika and Yani win with the lowest number of strokes. So in 2011, Yani had 272 which was lower than others in her year. In 2003, Annika had 278 which might have been the lowest for that year.\n\nHowever, to confirm whether their scores were indeed the lowest possible, I need to check if any other winners had higher or lower scores. For example, in 2011, Stacy Lewis had 280 and Jiyai Shin had 279, so 272 is indeed lower. In 2003, Annika's score was 278, which seems to be the lowest for that year.\n\nBut wait, let me check other years where they won:\n\n- **2003**: Annika S\u00f6renstam - 278\n- **2011**: Yani Tseng - 272\n\nLooking at these two, their scores are lower than others in their respective years. Now, to see if both of them had the lowest in all their winning years, I need to check each of their victories individually.\n\nBut wait, Annika won in 2003 with 278 strokes, which seems to be the only score for that year, so it's the lowest. Yani won in 2011 with 272, and Stacy Lewis and Jiyai Shin had higher scores that year. So both times, their stroke counts were indeed lower than others.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold true as per the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis confirms that Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng each achieved the lowest stroke count in their respective winning years based on the data. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim says: \"jiyal shin champion by beat inbee park in the 2012 open with 9 stroke.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to see which columns and rows are relevant.\n\n1. **Champion**: The claim mentions \"jiyal shin\" as the champion. Looking at the table, I need to find the row where the champion is \"jiyai shin.\"\n\n2. **Year**: The event mentioned is the \"2012 open.\" In the table, each row has a \"year\" column. So I'm looking for the 2012 row.\n\n3. **Runner-up**: The claim mentions \"inbee park\" as the runner-up. So I need to check if in 2012, jiyai shin beat inbee park.\n\n4. **Margin of Victory**: The claim specifies a margin of 9 strokes. In the table, the column is \"margin of victory,\" so I should look for that value in the relevant row.\n\nNow, let's go through the table step by step.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 2013: Champion is Stacy Lewis, not jiyai shin.\n- 2012: Year matches. Champion is jiyai shin. Runner-up is inbee park. The margin of victory is listed as \"9 strokes.\" That matches the claim's details.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the 2012 row in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"se ri pak be the champion in 2001 , then come 2nd place 2 year after.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. In 2001, Se Ri Pak was the champion.\n2. Two years after 2001, she came in second place.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant cells for each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part: Was Se Ri Pak the champion in 2001? I'll look for the year 2001 in the 'year' column. The row for 2001 has several details: champion is \"se ri pak.\" So that's correct; she won in 2001.\n\nNext, the second part: Two years after 2001 would be 2003. She should have come in second place that year. Checking the 2003 row, the 'runner(s) - up' column lists \"se ri pak\" as one of the runners-up, but it's not clear if she was second specifically. However, since the claim says \"come 2nd place,\" I need to verify her position.\n\nIn 2003, the champion was Annika S\u00f6renstam, and Se Ri Pak is listed among the runners-up. It doesn't specify the exact position, but typically in golf tournaments, if someone is a runner-up, it might mean they finished second. So, it's reasonable to infer that she came in second place in 2003.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I will carefully check each condition against the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Champion in 2001:** The claim states that Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001. Looking at the 2001 row in the table:\n   - Year: 2001\n   - Champion: \"se ri pak\"\n   \n   This matches the first part of the claim.\n\n2. **Determine Her Position in 2003:** The claim also states that Se Ri Pak came in second place two years after 2001, which would be 2003. Checking the 2003 row:\n   - Year: 2003\n   - Champion: \"annika s\u00f6renstam\"\n   - Runner(s) - up: \"se ri pak\"\n\n   Since she is listed as a runner-up in 2003 and typically runners-up finish second, this supports the claim that she came in second place.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both conditions of the claim are supported by the table data, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2001, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2003, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the 'champion' column, I see her name appears a few times. Specifically, she was the champion in 2009, as noted under that year.\n\nNext, the claim mentions she was the runner-up in 2008. So I need to check if she was the runner-up for that year. Looking at the 'runner (s) - up' column for 2008: It says \"jiyai shin.\" That's not Karrie Webb, so she wasn't the runner-up in 2008.\n\nWait, but the claim also states she became champion in 2010 and 2011. Let me check those years. In 2010, the champion is Yani Tseng. So that contradicts the claim because if she didn't win in 2010, then being a champion there isn't possible. But in 2011, again, the champion is Yani Tseng as well. So both 2010 and 2011, Karrie wasn't the champion.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that Karrie was the champion in 2009. Maybe the claim has some inaccuracies. Let me double-check each year mentioned in the claim against the table.\n\nFor 2008: Runner-up is Jiyai Shin, not Karrie.\nFor 2010: Champion is Yani Tseng, so Karrie isn't the champion there.\nFor 2011: Again, Champion is Yani Tseng, so same issue.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because Karrie Webb wasn't the runner-up in 2008 and didn't win in 2010 or 2011. She was only the champion in 2009, according to the table.\n\nNow, looking at the relevant cells: We need to check where Karrie is mentioned as a runner-up (2008) and as a champion (2010, 2011). From the table:\n\n- In 2008, under 'runner(s)-up', it's Jiyai Shin. So no cell for Karrie here.\n- In 2010, she isn't the champion; Yani Tseng is.\n- In 2011, same issue.\n\nSo there are no cells in the table where Karrie Webb is the runner-up in 2008 or the champion in those subsequent years as claimed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"annika s\u00f6renstam and catriona matthew win with the lowest number of stroke\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to information in the table. The key elements are \"annika s\u00f6renstam,\" \"catriona matthew,\" and \"lowest number of stroke.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2013. Each row includes various details like the champion and the runner-up(s). So, I should check which rows have these two names as the champion or runner-up.\n\nStarting with annika s\u00f6renstam: scanning through the table, I see she was the champion in 2003 (row 12) and also appears as a runner-up in some other years. For catriona matthew, looking at the table, she was the champion in 2009 (row 5). \n\nNow, focusing on their respective wins, the claim states they both won with the lowest number of strokes. To verify this, I need to look at the \"score\" column and the \"margin of victory\" for each of their victories.\n\nFirst, Annika S\u00f6renstam's win: in 2003 (row 12), her score was 278, and the margin was 1 stroke. \n\nNext, Catriona Matthew's win: in 2009 (row 5), her score was 285, with a margin of 3 strokes.\n\nNow, comparing these scores to others in their respective years might be necessary to see if they indeed had the lowest. However, since the claim is about both winning with the lowest number of strokes, perhaps it's referring to each of their individual wins being lower than others that year.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is saying that together, their wins were the lowest in terms of stroke counts. Alternatively, it could mean that among all champions, they had the lowest scores.\n\nLooking at the table, I can list out the score for each champion and see where Annika and Catriona stand.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 2013: Stacy Lewis - 280\n- 2012: Jiyai Shin - 279\n- 2011: Yani Tseng - 272\n- 2010: Yani Tseng - 277\n- 2009: Catriona Matthew - 285\n- 2008: Jiyai Shin - 270\n- 2007: Lorena Ochoa - 287\n- 2006: Sherri Steinhauer - 281\n- 2005: Jeong Jang - 272\n- 2004: Karen Stupples - 269\n- 2003: Annika S\u00f6renstam - 278\n- 2002: Karrie Webb - 273\n- 2001: Se Ri Pak - 277\n\nLooking at these scores, both Annika (278) and Catriona (285) have scores that are not the lowest. The lowest score is Karen Stupples in 2004 with 269. So, their wins don't have the lowest scores.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. The claim says \"with the lowest number of stroke.\" Maybe it's referring to their performance relative to others in the same event, not across all years.\n\nIn 2003, Annika won with a score of 278 and a margin of 1 stroke. Her runner-up was Se Ri Pak. So, her stroke count is lower than her predecessors but I'm not sure if it's the absolute lowest. Similarly, in 2009, Catriona had a higher score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about their wins having the smallest margins or something else, but the key words are \"lowest number of stroke,\" which likely refers to the total score.\n\nSince both of their scores (278 and 285) are not the lowest across all champions listed, the claim seems incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the table for Annika S\u00f6renstam and Catriona Matthew's championship games in 2003 and 2009 respectively. Their scores (278 and 285) are not among the lowest in their respective years, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 2012, jiyal shin earned 36517 more than yani tseng in 2011.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows correspond to 2012 and 2011. Looking at the 'year' column, 2012 is row 1 (since it's 0-indexed as per the table), and 2011 is row 3.\n\nNext, I need to find the relevant columns for each year. The claim mentions 'champion', so I should look at the 'champion' column for both years. In 2012, the champion is \"jiyai shin,\" and in 2011, it's \"yani tseng.\"\n\nNow, I need to check the 'winner's share' amounts for these two champions. For 2012 (row 1), the winner's share is 428650. For 2011 (row 3), it's 392133.\n\nCalculating the difference: 428650 - 392133 = 36417. Hmm, wait a minute. The claim says \"36517 more,\" but my calculation gives 36417. That\u2019s a slight discrepancy of 100 between 36,517 and 36,417.\n\nI should double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake. For row 2012: 428650 and for 2011: 392133. Let me subtract again: 428,650 minus 392,133 equals... 36,517? Wait, no, that's incorrect because 428,650 minus 392,133 is actually 36,517? Or did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n428,650\n- 392,133\n= ?\n\nSubtracting the units: 0 - 3. Can't do that, so borrow from tens place. But since all digits are zero except for hundreds, thousands, and ten-thousands places.\n\nWait, maybe I should line them up properly:\n\n428650\n-392133\n--------\nLet me subtract digit by digit starting from the right:\n0 - 3: Can't do, borrow. The next digit is also 5 (from tens place), which is 5 in the original number but becomes 4 after borrowing for the units.\nSo, 10 - 3 = 7.\nNext, the tens place: 4 (after borrow) minus 3: 1.\nHundreds place: 6 - 2 = 4.\nThousands place: 8 -9. Can't do that, so need to borrow from ten-thousands place. 4 becomes 3, and the thousands digit becomes 18 (since we borrowed 1 thousand which is 1000). So 18 - 9 = 9.\nTen-thousands place: 3 (after borrowing) minus 2 = 1.\n\nSo putting it all together: 36,517. Wait, so my initial calculation was correct at 36,517. Then why did I think the difference is 36,417 earlier? Maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction step.\n\nWait, maybe I should use another method to confirm. Let's subtract 392,133 from 428,650:\n\n392,133 + 36,517 = 428,650?\n\nLet me add them:\n392,133 + 36,517.\n\nAdding units: 3 +7=10, carryover 1.\nTens: 3 +1 +6=10, carryover 1.\nHundreds: 2 +5 +4 (carry) =11, carryover 1.\nThousands:9 +3 +1=13, carryover 1.\nTen-thousands: 3 +6 +1=10.\n\nSo total is 428,650. Yes, that checks out. So the difference is indeed 36,517, not 36,417 as I mistakenly thought earlier.\n\nWait, but in my initial subtraction, I got 36,517, which matches the claim's 36,517. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because jiyai shin earned exactly 36,517 more than yani tseng in 2011.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table, the 'winner's share' for 2012 is 428650 and for 2011 it's 392133. So yes, subtracting them gives 36,517. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells being row 1 (2012) in the 'champion' column and row 3 (2011) in the same column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because jiyai shin's 2012 earnings were indeed $36,517 more than yani tseng's 2011 earnings. The relevant cells are for both years in the champion column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify which cells are relevant to support that claim. The claim says, \"Se Ri Pak be the champion in 2001, then come 2nd place 2 year after.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts: \n1. Se Ri Pak won the championship in 2001.\n2. Two years after her victory (so in 2003), she came in second place.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2013. I'll go through each relevant year step by step.\n\nStarting with 2001: The champion for that year is listed as \"se ri pak\" under the 'champion' column (column_name: \"champion\"). So that's one relevant cell: row 2001, column \"champion\".\n\nNext, checking the claim about coming second two years later. Two years after 2001 would be 2003. In 2003, the champion is \"annika s\u00f6renstam.\" I need to see who was in second place that year. The 'runner (s) - up' column for 2003 lists \"se ri pak.\" So in 2003, Se Ri Pak finished second. That means row 2003 and column \"runner (s) - up\" is another relevant cell.\n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. For example, in 2001, the champion was Se Ri Pak, and in 2003, she was second. The claim doesn't specify whether it's exactly two years after or within two years; since it says \"2 year after,\" it's likely referring to the immediate next year, which would be 2002. However, looking at 2002, the champion is Karrie Webb, and Se Ri Pak isn't listed in second place there. So maybe I need to re-examine the timeline.\n\nWait, the claim says \"come 2nd place 2 year after,\" so from 2001 to 2003 is two years later. In 2003, she was indeed second, so that fits. Therefore, both conditions are met with the relevant cells being row 2001 (champion) and row 2003 (runner-up).\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE with those two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"jiyal shin champion by beat inbee park in the 2010 open with 9 stroke.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse this. The claim mentions two champions: Jiyal Shin and Inbee Park. It states that in the 2010 Open, Jiyal Shin defeated Inbee Park by a margin of 9 strokes.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if there's a year 2010 row where Jiyal Shin was the champion against Inbee Park with a margin of victory of 9 strokes.\n\nI'll start by locating the 2010 row in the table. Scanning through the years, I see the 2010 entry is the fifth one from the top. The columns include year, dates, venue, champion, country, score, to par, margin of victory, runner(s) - up, purse, and winner's share.\n\nNow, checking the champion column for 2010: the champion listed is Yani Tseng, not Jiyal Shin or Inbee Park. That already raises a red flag because the claim mentions Jiyal Shin as the champion.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me double-check. No, in the 2010 row, the \"champion\" column says \"yani tseng.\" So, that's different from both Jiyal Shin and Inbee Park mentioned in the claim.\n\nNext, checking the runner-up column for 2010: it lists \"katherine hull,\" not Inbee Park. So, that doesn't match either.\n\nThe margin of victory is \"1 stroke\" in 2010, which is less than the 9 strokes mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, multiple discrepancies here:\n1. The champion in 2010 was Yani Tseng, not Jiyal Shin.\n2. The runner-up wasn't Inbee Park; it was Katherine Hull.\n3. The margin of victory was only 1 stroke, not 9.\n\nSince all these points contradict the claim, I can confidently say that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Jiyal Shin won against Inbee Park in the 2010 Open with a 9-stroke margin. However, according to the table, the 2010 champion was Yani Tseng, and the runner-up was Katherine Hull, with only a 1-stroke victory.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"in 2012, jiyal shin earned 36517 less than yani tseng in 2011.\" Hmm, wait a minute. Let me make sure I got that right.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the year 2012 row to find out about Jiyai Shin. In 2012, the champion is listed as \"jiyai shin,\" and the runner-up is \"inbee park.\" The purse for that year was 2,750,000, with Jiyai Shin's share being 428,650. \n\nNext, I need to look at Yani Tseng's results in 2011. In 2011, the champion is Yani Tseng, and her score was 272, leading to a 4-stroke victory. The runner-up was Brittany Lang. The purse that year was 2,500,000, with Yani's share being 392,133.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"jiyal shin\" in 2012 and compares it to \"yani tseng in 2011.\" Wait, Jiyai Shin is a different golfer than Yani Tseng. The names don't match\u2014Jiyai Shin is sometimes referred to as Yayoi Shin in some sources, but not the same as Yani Tseng. That might be a mistake already.\n\nBut putting that aside, let's see if there's any data comparing their earnings directly. In 2012, Jiyai Shin earned 428,650. In 2011, Yani Tseng earned 392,133. The difference between these two would be 428,650 minus 392,133, which is approximately 36,517. So numerically, that matches the claim.\n\nHowever, the claim refers to \"jiyal shin\" in 2012 and \"yani tseng in 2011.\" Wait, Jiyai Shin isn't the same as Yani Tseng. They are two different golfers. So even though their earnings difference is correct numerically, the players mentioned don't align. Therefore, the claim's statement might be incorrect because it refers to different golfers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the names were misspelled or confused. But in the table, Jiyai Shin is listed as the champion in 2012, and Yani Tseng was the champion in 2011. So they are separate individuals. Therefore, comparing their earnings across years might not be directly related unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"jiyal shin earned 36517 less than yani tseng in 2011.\" But Jiyai Shin is from 2012, and Yani Tseng's 2011 share was 392,133. So if we take Jiyai Shin's 2012 earnings as 428,650, then 428,650 minus 392,133 equals 36,517, which matches the claim. However, since they are different people, it's not a comparison of the same golfer over two years but rather two different golfers in consecutive years.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the comparison between two different golfers across non-consecutive years. Or perhaps it's just a numerical coincidence that their earnings differ by that amount, but they aren't directly comparable since they didn't play against each other in those years.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the claim intended to say that in 2012, Jiyai Shin earned less than Yani Tseng in 2011. So it's comparing two different tournaments. That doesn't make sense because they are separate events. The purse amounts are per tournament, so each year's champion gets their share from their respective tournament.\n\nSo, in reality, the comparison isn't about the same golfer or even within the same event. Therefore, the claim is misleading because it suggests a direct comparison between two different champions from different years without context.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly compares the earnings of two different golfers from different years, leading to an apples-to-oranges comparison. Additionally, the names \"jiyai shin\" and \"yani tseng\" refer to separate individuals, making the comparison invalid.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
