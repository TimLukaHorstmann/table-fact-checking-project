    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the european championship have an extra 400 m hurdle.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the table. It has columns for year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. Each row represents a different event with details about where and when it happened, what the result was, and the extra information which seems to be the specific event or discipline.\n\nLooking at the claim, it's saying that the European Championship includes an extra 400 m hurdle. So I need to check if there's any entry in the 'extra' column that mentions \"400 m hurdles.\"\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **1973**: Extra is \"4x400 m relay.\" No mention of 400m hurdles.\n2. **1975**: Extra is \"800 m.\" Not relevant.\n3. **1976**: Extra is \"800 m.\" Again, not the hurdle.\n4. **1978**: First entry: extra is \"800 m.\" Second entry same year but different tournament? Wait, no, looking again, it's the same tournament as European Championships for both 1978 rows. The extras are \"800 m\" and \"400 m hurdles.\" So yes, in 1978, there's an entry with 400m hurdles.\n\nSo, since one of the entries under 'extra' is indeed \"400 m hurdle,\" the claim is supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"extra\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"extra\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided in markdown. The table has columns: year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. Each row represents a different event with its details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"the result of 1973 be 1st\". So I need to find the row where the year is 1973. Looking at the table, the first row (row index 0) has the year 1973. The tournament is the \" european junior championships\", held in \"duisburg , west germany\". The result for that year is listed as \"1st\", and the extra field is \"4x400 m relay\".\n\nSince the claim is about the result being 1st in 1973, I should check if the result column for that specific row matches. In this case, it does: the result is indeed \"1st\". \n\nNow, considering the instructions, I need to list the relevant cells. The only cell that's directly related here is the \"result\" column in the 1973 row because that's where the claim is focused on.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"TRUE\" because the statement correctly reflects the result from the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as the 1973 European Junior Championships resulted in a first place finish for the 4x400 m relay.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the claim: \"in 1979 the tournament of european indoor championship play where the extra be 800 m and the result be 2nd.\" I need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the year 1979. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's one entry for 1979:\n\n- Tournament: European indoor championships\n- Venue: Vienna, Austria\n- Result: 2nd\n- Extra: 800 m\n\nSo, in 1979, the tournament was the European Indoor Championships held in Vienna, Austria. The result was 2nd, and the extra event was 800 m.\n\nNow, let's dissect the claim. It mentions two main things: the extra being 800 m and the result being 2nd. From the table, both of these align perfectly with the 1979 European Indoor Championships entry.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries for 1979 to ensure this is the only relevant one, but from the table provided, there's only that one row for 1979.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. The tournament in question is indeed the European Indoor Championships in 1979 with the extra as 800 m and the result being 2nd.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately matches the 1979 European Indoor Championships entry in the table.

Let's start by breaking down the claim: \"in 1979 be the year of the tournament play call the european indor champion where the team finish 2nd with an extra of 800 m.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the year mentioned in the claim, which is 1979. I'll search the table for any entries in that year. The table has five rows; row index 4 corresponds to 1979.\n\nNext, the claim refers to \"european indor champion.\" Looking at the 'tournament' column, there's an entry for \"european indoor championships\" which seems like it might be a typo but is probably referring to the same thing. So I'll look for that in the tournament column.\n\nIn 1979, the tournament was \"european indoor championships\" held in Vienna, Austria. The result was 2nd place, and the extra was 800 m. That matches all parts of the claim: the year is correct, the tournament name as per the table (though slightly misspelled), the venue, the result of 2nd, and the extra event being 800 m.\n\nSo all four columns (year, tournament, venue, result) match the claim's conditions.

The claim is: \"european junior championship be 1st in 1973\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see if there's an entry that matches all parts of this claim. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nThe first row is year 1973. The tournament is European Junior Championships. The venue is Duisburg, West Germany. The result is 1st, and the extra is the 4x400 m relay. So, this seems relevant because it's about the European Junior Championships in 1973 with a 1st place finish.\n\nNow, let me break down the claim: \"European junior championship be 1st in 1973\". The key points here are that it's the European Junior Championships (tournament name), they achieved 1st place, and this happened in 1973. \n\nLooking at the first row, all these conditions are met. They were the European Junior Championships, their result was 1st, and the year is 1973. The venue and extra details aren't part of the claim, so I don't need to consider them beyond ensuring they match.\n\nSo, this row directly supports the claim. There's no conflicting information or another entry that would contradict it. Therefore, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows an entry in 1973 where the European Junior Championships achieved a 1st place result.

The key columns here are 'tournament', 'result', and possibly 'year' and 'venue'.\n\nFirst, I should check when the European Junior Championships started appearing in the data. Scanning through the years:\n\n- 1973: European Junior Championships, Duisburg, West Germany, 1st place, 4x400m relay.\n- 1975: European Indoor Championships, Katowice, Poland, 1st place, 800m.\n- 1976: Olympics, Montreal, Canada, 4th, 800m.\n- 1978: European Championships, Prague, Czechoslovakia, 6th, 800m.\n- 1978: Same venue and year but different event (400m hurdles), also 6th.\n- 1979: European Indoor Championships, Vienna, Austria, 2nd, 800m.\n\nWait, so the first mention of European Junior Championships is in 1973. The claim mentions \"since 1975,\" which is four years after that. So I need to see if from 1975 onwards, they came in second place.\n\nLooking at the relevant rows:\n\n- From 1975 onwards: 1975 shows European Indoor Championships, not Juniors.\n- 1976: Olympics, not relevant for the claim.\n- 1978 and 1979: European Championships but as 6th, not second.\n- The last row is 1979, which is European Indoor again.\n\nI don't see any entries in the table where the European Junior Championships came in second place after 1975.

The claim is: \"before 1979, be when the tournament of european indoor championship play where the extra be 800 m and the result be 2nd.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It seems to be asking about the European Indoor Championships before 1979. Specifically, it's looking for a tournament where the \"extra\" was 800m and the \"result\" was 2nd.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple entries for the European Indoor Championships. Let me list them out:\n\n1. In 1975, Katowice, Poland: result is 1st in 800m.\n2. In 1979, Vienna, Austria: result is 2nd in 800m.\n\nThe claim mentions \"before 1979,\" so I should focus on the 1975 event because 1979 is after 1975 but before 1979? Wait, no, 1979 is after 1975. So the events before 1979 would include 1973, 1975, and 1978 (since 1978 is in 1978, which is before 1979). Wait, actually, the years are 1973, 1975, 1976, 1978, and 1979. So events before 1979 would be 1973, 1975, 1976, and 1978.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these relevant rows for European Indoor Championships where the extra is 800m and result is 2nd.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1975: result is 1st in 800m. So that's not 2nd.\n- 1978: I see two entries for 1978, both for European Championships but one is 6th in 800m and the other is 6th in 400m hurdles. Neither is 2nd.\n\nWait, there's a row for 1979 which is Vienna, Austria with result 2nd in 800m. But since the claim says \"before 1979,\" does that mean before 1979? So 1979 would be after, so not included. Therefore, none of the European Indoor Championships before 1979 have a result of 2nd in 800m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"be when the tournament... play where the extra be 800 m and the result be 2nd.\" So perhaps it's saying that for some year before 1979, in a European Indoor Championship, the extra was 800m and the result was 2nd.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- 1975: result is 1st in 800m.\n- 1978: both entries are 6th in different events.\n- 1973: Not relevant because it's not European Indoor Championships but European junior championships.\n\nSo, there's no row before 1979 where European Indoor Championship had extra as 800m and result as 2nd. The only one that fits is the 1979 entry, which is after the cutoff year of 1979. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no event before 1979 that meets both criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
