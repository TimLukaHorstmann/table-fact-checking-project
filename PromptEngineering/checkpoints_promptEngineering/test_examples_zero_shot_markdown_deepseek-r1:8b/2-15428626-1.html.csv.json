    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table here with a bunch of football game data from 1963. The claim is that \"October 27, 1963\" was the date of the game against the Houston Oilers. My task is to check if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by looking at the table and figuring out which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week, starting from week 1 in September through December. \n\nThe claim mentions \"October 27, 1963\" as the date and the opponent being the Houston Oilers. So I need to look into the table to find if there's such a game on that date against Houston Oilers.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table one by one. Starting from week 1:\n\n- Week 1: September 8, 1963 vs Buffalo Bills\n- Week 2: September 14, 1963 vs Boston Patriots\n- Week 3: September 29, 1963 vs Kansas City Chiefs\n- Week 4: October 6, 1963 vs Denver Broncos\n- Week 5: October 13, 1963 vs New York Jets\n- Week 6: October 20, 1963 vs Kansas City Chiefs\n- Week 7: October 27, 1963 vs Oakland Raiders\n\nWait, here's week 7 on October 27 against Oakland Raiders, not Houston Oilers. So that's not the game in question.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Week 8: November 2, 1963 vs New York Jets\n- Week 9: November 10, 1963 vs Boston Patriots\n- Week 10: November 17, 1963 vs Buffalo Bills\n- Week 11: December 1, 1963 vs Houston Oilers\n- Week 12: December 8, 1963 vs Oakland Raiders\n- Week 13: December 15, 1963 vs Houston Oilers\n- Week 14: December 22, 1963 vs Denver Broncos\n\nLooking at week 11 and week 13, those are the two games against the Houston Oilers. But neither of them is on October 27.\n\nWait, the claim says \"October 27, 1963\" specifically. So I need to check if any game in that date exists against Houston Oilers. From the table, the only games against Houston Oilers are week 11 and week 13, which are in December.\n\nSo there's no game on October 27 against Houston Oilers. The claim must be referring to a specific game, but according to this table, it doesn't exist. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that a game occurred on \"October 27, 1963\" against the Houston Oilers. By examining each week's data in the provided table, no such game is found on that date against the Houston Oilers. The relevant weeks and dates for Houston Oilers games are week 11 (December 1) and week 13 (December 15), both after October.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
