Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"marc surer score 4 more point in 1985 compare to 1984.\" So, I'm looking for Marc Surer's points in 1984 and 1985 to see if there's an increase of exactly 4 points.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice that the years range from 1979 to 1986. The columns include year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. My main focus here is on the 'entrant' column and the corresponding 'points' for each year.\n\nI need to find if Marc Surer was an entrant in both 1984 and 1985. If he wasn't, then the claim doesn't apply. Let's go through the table row by row.\n\nIn 1984:\n- The entries are \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" with two different chassis but same year. I don't see Marc Surer listed here.\n\nIn 1985:\n- There's an entry for \"motor racing developments ltd,\" which has a points value of 5. Again, no mention of Marc Surer.\n\nSo, it seems Marc Surer wasn't an entrant in either 1984 or 1985 based on the table provided. Therefore, there can't be any comparison between his points in those years because he didn't participate then.\n\nSince the claim assumes that Marc Surer scored 4 more points in 1985 compared to 1984, but he wasn't even present in both years, the claim doesn't hold true based on the data given.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

It lists various teams, their chassis, engines, and points for each year from 1979 to 1986.\n\nI need to check if Marc Surer scored exactly 5 points in 1985 and 1986. So, I should find all entries where the entrant is \"Marc Surer\" and see what points they got in those years.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- In 1985, the entrant listed is \"motor racing developments ltd,\" which doesn't match Marc Surer.\n- In 1986, there's an entry for \"barclay arrows bmw,\" not Marc Surer.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm looking at the wrong column. The claim mentions points, but perhaps I need to check the entrant's name as well. Maybe Marc Surer is using a different name or team alias in these years?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a team named Marc Surer in 1985 and 1986. Let me go through each year again:\n\nIn 1985, \"motor racing developments ltd\" with Brabham BT54 and BMW engine scored 5 points. Is this considered Marc Surer? Or is Marc Surer another person?\n\nSimilarly, in 1986, \"barclay arrows bmw\" scored 0 points with an A8 chassis and BMW engine.\n\nI don't see any entry for Marc Surer in either 1985 or 1986. So, if the claim says he scored 5 points in both years, that's not supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of Marc Surer scoring 5 points in those specific years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 5 points in both 1985 and 1986. However, upon examining the table, there are no entries for Marc Surer in either 1985 or 1986. The highest points for any team in 1985 was 5, but it wasn't Marc Surer.

It mentions \"Marc Surer\" scoring 4 points and then later scoring 0 points, with the time difference being 1 second in favor of the lower score. So, is it saying that when Marc scored 4 points, he finished in a time that was faster than his previous race where he scored 0 points by 1 second?\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all entries related to \"Marc Surer.\" Wait, but I don't see any row with \"Marc Surer\" as the entrant.

There's no Marc Surer listed here.\n\nSo, if Marc Surer isn't in the table, that might mean there's no data to support the claim. Therefore, the claim can't be verified from the given information.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"marc surer score a total of 8 points in the 2 races of 1981.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It's a table with columns for year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. Each row seems to represent a different entry or team participating in some racing event, along with their performance (points scored).\n\nNow, the claim mentions Marc Surer scoring 8 points across two races in 1981. So I need to check if there are any entries in the table for 1981 where Marc Surer is listed as an entrant and the total points from that year amount to 8.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that in 1981, there are two entries:\n- \"ensign racing\" with 4 points.\n- \"theodore racing team\" also with 4 points.\n\nNeither of these entrants is Marc Surer. So first off, it seems like Marc Surer isn't even present in the table for 1981. That would mean he didn't participate in those races, so he couldn't have scored any points, let alone 8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check all rows from 1979 to 1986 to see if Marc Surer is listed anywhere as an entrant. Scanning through the table, I don't see \"Marc Surer\" appearing in the 'entrant' column at all. So it's confirmed that he wasn't part of any team listed here.\n\nSince there's no entry for Marc Surer in 1981 or any other relevant year that could contribute to 8 points, the claim doesn't hold up. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 8 points across two races in 1981. However, upon examining the table, there are no entries for Marc Surer as an entrant during that year or any other year in the provided data.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify the claim:** Marc Surer scored 8 points in two 1981 races.\n2. **Check the table for 1981 entrants:** Only \"ensign racing\" and \"theodore racing team\" are listed with 4 points each, neither being Marc Surer.\n3. **Scan all rows for Marc Surer:** He doesn't appear as an entrant in any of the table's entries.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Marc Surer isn't present in the relevant races, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"marc surer score 2 time as many point in 1986 than 1983.\" So, Marc Surer's points in 1986 should be twice what he had in 1983 for this to be true.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the rows for Marc Surer in both 1983 and 1986. Let me scan each row:\n\nIn 1983, is there a team named \"marc surer\"? Hmm, no. The teams listed are Arrow Racing Team, Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW, Motor Racing Developments Ltd, and Barclay Arrows BMW in 1984. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"marc surer score a total of 6 points in 1986, 3 more than in 1985.\" So, we're looking to see if Marc Surer had a points total of 6 in 1986 and 3 more than 1985. That would mean he scored 3 points in 1985 and 6 in 1986.\n\nNow, I need to look at the table provided and check for relevant cells related to this claim. The table has several columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. Each row represents a different entry with details about that year's performance.\n\nMy first step is to search the table for any entries where \"Marc Surer\" or similar names might appear as the entrant. However, looking at the table, I see that the entrants are various racing teams like team ensign, team ats, ensign racing, theodore racing team, arrows racing team, barclay nordica arrows bmw, motor racing developments ltd, and barclay arrows bmw.\n\nI don't see any entry where the entrant is \"Marc Surer.\" It's possible that \"marc surer\" might be a misspelling or an alternative name, but based on the table provided, it doesn't seem like Marc Surer is listed as an entrant in any of the years. So, maybe the claim isn't directly supported by this table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding who Marc Surer is. Maybe he's a driver associated with one of these teams without being explicitly listed as the entrant. But looking at each row, it seems like the entrants are the teams or organizations, not individual drivers. So unless \"Marc Surer\" was part of a team's name, which doesn't seem to be the case here, there's no direct evidence from this table supporting his points in 1985 and 1986.\n\nAnother angle is to check if any of the points total to 3 or 6 for those years. Looking at the table:\n\n- In 1985, the only entry is \"motor racing developments ltd\" with 5 points.\n- In 1986, \"barclay arrows bmw\" has 0 points.\n\nThere's no mention of Marc Surer in 1985 or 1986. Therefore, there's no data to support that he scored any points in those years, let alone the specified numbers.\n\nSo, putting this together, since there are no relevant cells in the table that directly relate to Marc Surer scoring 3 points in 1985 and 6 in 1986, the claim isn't supported by the provided information. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Marc Surer's points is not supported by the table data, as there are no relevant entries for him in 1985 or 1986.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"marc surer score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance.\n\nFirst, I need to parse what the claim is saying. It mentions \"Marc Surer\" scoring 6 points and \"2 points\" in total. Wait, does it mean that Marc Surer scored 6 points more than he did when he had only 2 points? Or is it referring to a specific race where he scored 6 points compared to another instance where he scored 2 points?\n\nLooking at the table, I need to see if there's any data related to \"Marc Surer.\" Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nThe table has entries from 1979 to 1986. The columns are year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. Scanning down the list of entrants:\n\n- 1979: team ensign\n- 1980: team ats (twice)\n- 1981: ensign racing and theodore racing team\n- 1982: arrows racing team (three entries)\n- 1983: arrows racing team\n- 1984: barclay nordica arrows bmw (two entries)\n- 1985: motor racing developments ltd\n- 1986: barclay arrows bmw\n\nI don't see any entry with \"Marc Surer\" as the entrant. So, does that mean he's not in the table? If Marc Surer isn't listed as an entrant in any of these years, then maybe the claim is false because there's no data to support it.\n\nBut wait, perhaps \"marc surer\" refers to someone else or maybe the name was misspelled. Let me check each entrant again:\n\n- team ensign\n- team ats\n- ensign racing\n- theodore racing team\n- arrows racing team\n- barclay nordica arrows bmw\n- motor racing developments ltd\n- barclay arrows bmw\n\nNo Marc Surer here. So, if he's not in the table, then the claim can't be verified based on this data. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, since there's no entry for Marc Surer, I don't need to point out any specific cells from the table because his name isn't present. But according to the instructions, I have to list all relevant cells regardless of whether they support the claim. However, in this case, since there are no relevant cells (because he's not in the table), maybe it's just an empty list.\n\nWait, but the instructions say that if fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise, answer FALSE. Since Marc Surer isn't in the table, the claim can't be supported, so it's FALSE. But do I need to specify which cells are relevant? In this case, since there are no relevant cells, maybe the list is empty.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the claim is false because Marc Surer isn't present in the table as an entrant, and thus there's no data to support the comparison he made.
