The claim mentions a company or product name \"reestore\" with a money requested amount of 50,000 and involves entrepreneurs Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where \"company or product name\" is \"reestore\", the money requested is 50000, and the entrepreneurs include both Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis. \n\nI'll go through each episode:\n\n- **Episode 4**: \n  - First aired on 5 November 2007.\n  - Entrepreneurs: Max McMurdo.\n  - Company/product: Reestore.\n  - Money requested: 50,000.\n  - Investors: Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis.\n\nThis row matches exactly what the claim states. So, there's a relevant cell here.\n\nOther rows with \"reestore\" or similar might not fit, but this one is spot on.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about an episode is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"in episode 7, 145000 be the highest amount of money request by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant parts of the table for episode 7. In the table, each row corresponds to an episode number, and within that, there's information about the entrepreneur(s), company or product name, money requested, and investing dragons.\n\nLooking at episode 7, there are two rows:\n\n1. Entrepreneurs: Sammy French; Company/Product: Fit Fur Life; Money Requested: \u00a3100,000; Dragons: James Caan.\n2. Entrepreneurs: Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker; Company/Product: JPM Eco Logistics; Money Requested: \u00a3100,000; Dragons: Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis.\n\nWait, the claim says that in episode 7, \u00a3145,000 is the highest amount requested by Jerry Mantalvanos and Paul Merker. But looking at the table, both entrepreneurs in episode 7 have a money request of \u00a3100,000 each. There's no row where they requested \u00a3145,000.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other episodes had higher amounts. For example:\n\n- Episode 6: One entrepreneur requested \u00a3145,000, but that was for Steri Spray by Ian Helmore. That's a different company and different entrepreneurs.\n- Episode 8: Peter Moule requested \u00a3150,000 for Electroexpo and Chocbox.\n\nSo the highest amount in episode 7 is indeed \u00a3100,000 by both of its entrepreneurs. The claim mentions \u00a3145,000, which isn't present in any of the relevant rows for episode 7. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"entrepreneur(s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"game alert ask for 200000.\" I'm given a markdown table with several columns and rows, each representing different episodes of something, probably Shark Tank since the context seems familiar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like episode number, first aired date, entrepreneurs involved, company or product name, money requested, and investing dragons (probably referring to investors or dragons from a show like Dragon's Den). \n\nThe claim mentions \"game alert ask for 200000.\" So, I need to find any row where the company or product is \"game alert\" and the money requested is 200,000. If such a row exists, the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLooking through each episode:\n\n- Episode 1: Companies are Beach Break Live (50k), Goldgenie (60k)\n- Episode 2: Youdoodoll (35k), Gaming Alerts (200k)\n- Episode 3: Concentrate Design (100k)\n- Episode 4: Restore (50k), Cush'n 'shade' (100k)\n- Episode 5: Hungryhousecouk (100k)\n- Episode 6: Steri spray (145k), Caribbean Ready Meals (100k)\n- Episode 7: Fit Fur Life (100k), JPM Eco Logistics (100k)\n- Episode 8: Electroexpo & Chocbox (150k)\n- Episode 9: Red Button Design (50k)\n\nWait, in episode 2, there's a company called Gaming Alerts which requested 200,000. But the claim is about \"game alert,\" not \"gaming alerts.\" So that might be different.\n\nSo, I need to check if any company is named \"Game Alert\" and the money requested is 200,000.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Episode 2: Company is \"Gaming Alerts,\" which is not exactly \"Game Alert.\"\n- All other companies don't match \"Game Alert.\"\n\nTherefore, there's no row where the company name is \"Game Alert\" with a request of 200,000. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The term \"game alert\" might be a variation or similar to \"gaming alerts.\" But in the table, it's specifically listed as \"Gaming Alerts,\" not \"Game Alert.\" So unless there's another company with that exact name, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be the one for episode 2, column \"company or product name\" because it's \"gaming alerts\" but the money is 200k. However, since the claim refers to \"game alert,\" which isn't in the table, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Or is it just one?\n\nIn the table, for Episode 4, the first row has company name \"reestore\" and money requested 50000 with investors Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis. But the claim says 70000.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see where these elements might correspond. Let me break down the claim into parts.\n\n1. **Company names**: \"beach break live\" and \"cone timentrate design.\"\n2. **Investor**: Peter Jones.\n3. **Money requested**: More than 35,000.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if these match up.\n\nStarting with episode 1: There's a company called \"beach break live\" and the money requested is 50,000. The investor listed here is Peter Jones. So, this row has both the correct company and investor, but the money is more than 35k.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"more than 35000,\" which 50k does satisfy. But then there's another entry in episode 1: \"goldgenie (formerly midas touch)\" with a request of 60k and James Caan as investor. That doesn't match the claim at all.\n\nMoving to episode 2: The first company is \"youdoodoll\" with 35k requested by Deborah Meaden, which doesn't fit. The second entry in episode 2 has \"gaming alerts\" with a much higher request of 200k and investors including Theo Paphitis, not Peter Jones.\n\nEpisode 3: \"concentrate design\" is here, but the money is 100k and investor is Peter Jones again. So this row matches company and investor, but the amount is exactly 100k, which doesn't meet \"more than 35k.\" Wait, no\u2014the claim says more than 35k, so 50k or above. But 100k does satisfy that condition.\n\nWait, but in episode 1, beach break live had 50k, which meets the criteria. So maybe the claim is correct there.\n\nIn episode 4: There are two companies. \"reestore\" with 50k, investors include Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis. The second company, \"cush'n 'shade,\" has 100k requested by Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden again. So here, the claim's second part mentions \"cone timentrate design.\" I don't see that in episode 4.\n\nEpisode 5: Companies are \"hungryhousecouk\" with 100k, investors including James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne, which doesn't match.\n\nEpisode 6: Two companies. \"st\u0435\u0440\u0438 spray\" with 145k requested by Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis. The second is \"caribbean ready meals\" with 100k and investors including James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne.\n\nEpisode 7: \"fit fur life\" with 100k, investor James Caan. The other company, \"jpm eco logistics,\" has 100k requested by Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.\n\nEpisode 8: Companies are \"electroexpo , chocbox\" with 150k and investors including Duncan Bannatyne and James Caan.\n\nEpisode 9: \"red button design\" with 50k, but all five dragons as investors, not Peter Jones alone.\n\nSo, looking back at the claim: it mentions both \"beach break live\" and \"cone timentrate design.\" In the table, I see that \"beach break live\" is in episode 1 with a request of 50k. The second part, \"cone timentrate design,\" isn't mentioned in any row except episode 3's \"concentrate design,\" which is different.\n\nWait, maybe there's confusion between \"cone timentrate design\" and another name. But in the table, I don't see a company named exactly that. So perhaps the claim is trying to say that both these companies were invested by Peter Jones with more than 35k requested.\n\nFrom the table:\n- beach break live: episode 1, 50k, Peter Jones.\n- concentrate design: episode 3, 100k, Peter Jones.\n\nSo both have money over 35k and are invested by Peter. The claim says \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" It's possible there's a typo, but assuming the second company is correct as per the table, then yes.\n\nWait, no\u2014the second part of the claim might be referring to another company. Since \"cone timentrate design\" isn't present except as \"concentrate design,\" maybe the claim is incorrect because it refers to a non-existent company.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that both companies (beach break live and cone timentrate) were invested by Peter Jones with more than 35k. But in the table, only beach break live and concentrate design are associated with Peter Jones. If \"cone timentrate\" isn't a real company here, then maybe the claim is false.\n\nWait, let me double-check: In the table, under episode 1, the first row has beach break live with 50k and Peter Jones as investor. Episode 3's concentrate design is 100k and Peter Jones as investor. So both companies have been invested by him, each requesting more than 35k.\n\nBut the claim says \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" The second part may be a typo or incorrect name, but since in the table, it's \"concentrate design,\" not \"cone timentrate,\" maybe that's an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct if \"cone timentrate\" is another term for concentrate design. But I don't think so; they're different names.\n\nSo, to sum up: \n- beach break live was invested by Peter Jones with 50k.\n- concentrate design was invested by Peter Jones with 100k.\n\nBut the claim mentions two separate companies: beach break and cone timentrate, both invested by him with over 35k. Since \"cone timentrate\" isn't present, but only \"concentrate design,\" maybe it's a mistake in the claim.\n\nTherefore, if the second company is incorrect, then the statement is false. But if we consider that perhaps there's a typo and they meant concentrate design, then both companies were invested by Peter with over 35k, making the claim true.\n\nAlternatively, since \"cone timentrate design\" isn't present, it's incorrect.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, but considering possible typos, I think the intended answer is that yes, both companies were invested by Peter Jones with more than 35k. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" Based on the table provided:\n\n1. **Beach Break Live**: \n   - Found in Episode 1, invested by Peter Jones, with a request of 50k.\n   \n2. **Cone Timentrate Design**:\n   - Not explicitly mentioned in any episode's company list; however, \"concentrate design\" is present in Episode 3, invested by Peter Jones with a request of 100k.\n\nGiven the possible typographical error, it's reasonable to assume that the claim refers to both companies being invested by Peter Jones. Therefore, considering potential naming variations and the provided data:\n\n**Answer**: The claim is true as both \"beach break live\" and \"concentrate design\" were invested by Peter Jones with requests exceeding 35k.",

First, I'll carefully analyze each part of the claim and see how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nThe claim has two main parts: \"game alert\" and \"ask for the least amount of money.\" Let's break these down.\n\nStarting with \"game alert,\" I look at the 'company or product name' column in the table. Scanning through each row, I see companies like Beach Break Live, Goldgenie, Youdoodoll, etc. None of these names mention \"game alert.\" So it seems that there's no direct reference to a company named Game Alert in the table.\n\nNext, considering \"ask for the least amount of money,\" I need to look at the 'money requested' column and see if any entry refers to the least amount. The 'money requested' values range from 50000 to 145000. To find the least amount, I should identify the smallest figure in this column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Episode 1: 50,000\n- Episode 2: 35,000 and 200,000\n- Episode 3: 100,000\n- Episode 4: 50,000\n- Episode 5: 100,000\n- Episode 6: 145,000 and 100,000\n- Episode 7: 100,000\n- Episode 8: 150,000\n- Episode 9: 50,000\n\nThe smallest amount is 35,000 from episode 2. Now, I check if this corresponds to a company called Game Alert. However, in the table, the row with 35,000 is for \"youdoodoll\" and the entrepreneurs are Sarah Lu. There's no mention of Game Alert here.\n\nSince there's no company named Game Alert and the least amount of money requested isn't tied to it, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
