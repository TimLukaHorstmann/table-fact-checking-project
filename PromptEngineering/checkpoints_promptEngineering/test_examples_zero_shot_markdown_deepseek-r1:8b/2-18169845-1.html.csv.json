    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"Daniel Boaventura be 1 of 6 people who play Gomez Addams\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has various roles and different casts from original Broadway, closing Broadway, original US Tour, etc., each with their respective actors.\n\nThe claim mentions Daniel Boaventura and Gomez Addams. So I need to check if there's a cell that lists Daniel Boaventura as part of the cast for Gomez Addams in any category.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Under \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast,\" G\u00f3mez Addams is played by Daniel Boaventura.\n- No other entries under Gomez Addams have Daniel Boaventura except for this row.\n\nThe claim says he's one of six people. But from the table, it seems there are only two actors listed for G\u00f3mez Addams: Nathan Lane and Daniel Boaventura in different categories. Wait, no\u2014actually, each role has multiple cast members across different productions. For example, the original Broadway cast, closing Broadway, etc., all have their own sets of actors.\n\nWait, but looking at \"original broadway cast,\" G\u00f3mez Addams is Nathan Lane. The \"closing broadway cast\" has Roger Rees. Then in the \"original us tour cast,\" it's Douglas Sills, and so on. Each of these is a separate production.\n\nSo Daniel Boaventura is listed under \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast.\" Does that mean he's one of six? Or is each cast separate?\n\nI think the key here is whether Daniel Boaventura is playing G\u00f3mez Addams in any category, regardless of the specific tour. The claim says \"1 of 6 people,\" implying there are six different actors who have played G\u00f3mez Addams across all categories.\n\nLooking at the table, each role's cast lists actors for different productions. For example, Gomez Addams has Nathan Lane (original Broadway), Roger Rees (closing Broadway), Douglas Sills (original US Tour), Jesse Sharp (original nonequity tour), Daniel Boaventura (s\u00e3o paulo), and Diego Bertie (lima). So that's six actors: Nathan, Roger, Douglas, Jesse, Daniel, Diego.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Daniel is indeed one of six who have played Gomez Addams in different productions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"gomez addams\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine if a certain claim about a table is true or false. The table lists different roles from the Addams Family plays and their respective casts in various productions like original Broadway, closing Broadway, etc., including the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"Pugsley Addams be the only role that have 3 people available to play it in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim means. It's stating that in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast of Pugsley Addams, there are exactly three different actors who could portray him. My job is to check if this is accurate based on the table provided.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, each row represents a character (like \"Pugsley Addams\"), and the columns represent different casts, such as original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, etc. The rows under each character list the actors who played them in each of these casts.\n\nSince the claim is about the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast, I should focus on that specific column for Pugsley Addams. So, I need to find which row corresponds to Pugsley Addams and then look at the actors listed under the \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" column.\n\nFrom the table provided, I see that Pugsley Addams is in the fifth row (since it's the fourth character after Lurch). The original S\u00e3o Paulo cast for Pugsley Addams has three names: \"nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz , matheus lustosa.\" Wait, actually, looking closely, the cell under \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" is written as \"nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz , matheus lustosa.\"\n\nSo, this seems to indicate that there are three actors available to play Pugsley Addams in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. \n\nBut wait, I should double-check if any other characters also have three actors listed under their \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" column. The claim specifies \"Pugsley Addams be the only role,\" so I need to ensure no other roles have three actors in that specific cast.\n\nLooking through each character's original S\u00e3o Paulo cast:\n\n- Gomez Addams: 1\n- Morticia Addams: 1\n- Uncle Fester: 1\n- Grandma Addams: 1\n- Wednesday Addams: 1\n- Pugsley Addams: 3\n- Lurch: 1\n- Mal Beineke: 1\n- Alice Beineke: 1\n- Lucas Beineke: 1\n\nFrom this, only Pugsley Addams has three actors listed in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. So, the claim is stating that he's the only one with three available, which seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"bebe neuwirth play morticia addams in the original broadway cast and krysta rodriguez play wednesday addams.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about Bebe Neuwirth playing Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast. The second part is about Krysta Rodriguez playing Wednesday Addams.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized with roles and various casts from different productions like original Broadway, closing Broadway, etc. Each role has an original cast listed.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: Bebe Neuwirth as Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast. I'll check the \"original broadway cast\" column for the role \"morticia addams\". From the table, under the role Morticia Addams, the original Broadway cast is Bebe Neuwirth. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the second part: Krysta Rodriguez as Wednesday Addams. Checking the same role in the original Broadway cast, I see that Krysta Rodriguez is indeed listed there. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are for Morticia Addams (original Broadway) and Wednesday Addams (original Broadway).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"morticia addams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wednesday addams\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"adam riegler and zachary james play their same role in both the original broadway cast and the closing broadway cast.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify who Adam Riegler and Zachary James are in the context of the table. Looking at the table, each row represents a character from the show, and the columns represent different casts: original Broadway, closing Broadway, etc.\n\nStarting with \"Adam Riegler,\" I'll look through each column to see if his name appears. In the 'original broadway cast' column, under 'pugsley addams,' I see Adam Riegler's name. Then, in the 'closing broadway cast' column, same character 'pugsley addams' has Adam Riegler again. So he plays the same role in both casts.\n\nNow for \"Zachary James,\" checking each column: In the original Broadway cast, under 'lurch,' Zachary James is listed. In the closing Broadway cast, same character 'lurch' also has Zachary James. Therefore, he also plays the same role in both casts.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if both actors play their respective roles in both casts as per the claim. Since both Adam Riegler and Zachary James are present in both the original and closing Broadway casts for their characters, the claim holds true.\n\nI should note down which cells are relevant. For Adam Riegler, it's row 5 (pugsley addams) in the 'original broadway cast' and row 5 in 'closing broadway cast.'

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a certain claim about the original Lima cast is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the original lima cast have 11 people available to play 10 role unlike the original broadway cast which only have 10 people available to play 10 role.\" So, the main points here are that the Lima cast has 11 members but can play for 10 roles, whereas the Broadway cast has exactly 10 members who can also play 10 roles.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to verify this by checking the relevant columns and rows. The columns related here would likely be \"original lima cast\" and perhaps others like \"original broadway cast.\" Each row in the table lists an individual role along with their respective casts.\n\nSo, first, I should identify the number of people listed under each cast category. Let me start by looking at the \"original lima cast\" column. Scanning down, I see:\n\n- gomez addams: diego bertie\n- morticia addams: no one listed (wait, actually, looking again, I think I might have missed some names. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, in the table provided, for \"original lima cast,\" under each role, there are multiple entries separated by commas for some roles. For example:\n\n- pugsley addams: giuseppino castellano , brando gallesi\n\nSimilarly, other roles might have more than one person listed. So I need to count the total number of individuals in the \"original lima cast\" column.\n\nLet me list them out per role:\n\n1. gomez addams: diego bertie \u2013 1 person\n2. morticia addams: no name listed, but looking at the table, it's fiorella rodriguez for closing broadway cast. Wait, in the original lima cast, under morticia addams, is there a name? Let me check the markdown again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n| role             | original broadway cast   | closing broadway cast   | original us tour cast   | original nonequity tour cast   | original s\u00e3o paulo cast                             | original lima cast                     |\n|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| morticia addams  | bebe neuwirth            | brooke shields          | sara gettelfinger       | keleen snowgren                | marisa orth                                         | fiorella rodriguez                     |\n\nSo for \"original lima cast,\" under morticia addams, it's fiorella rodriguez. So that's one person.\n\n3. uncle fester: nicol\u00e1s fantinato \u2013 1\n4. grandma addams: patricia portocarrero \u2013 1\n5. wednesday addams: gina yangali \u2013 1\n6. pugsley addams: giuseppino castellano , brando gallesi \u2013 2 people\n7. lurch: gustavo mayer \u2013 1\n8. mal beineke: miguel alvarez \u2013 1\n9. alice beineke: trilce cavero \u2013 1\n10. lucas beineke: luis baca \u2013 1\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\ngomez addams: 1\n\nmorticia: 1 (fiorella)\n\nuncle fester: 1\n\ngrandma:1\n\nwednesday:1\n\npugsley:2\n\nlurch:1\n\nmal beineke:1\n\nalice:1\n\nlucas:1\n\nTotal = 11 people in the original Lima cast.\n\nNext, I need to check how many roles there are. The claim says they have 10 roles available to play 10 roles. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me parse it again. The original Lima cast has 11 people available to play 10 roles, unlike the Broadway cast which only has 10 people for 10 roles.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of roles is 10, so they need at least 10 people, but the Lima cast has 11, meaning more than enough, while the Broadway cast exactly has 10. So that seems to fit the claim.\n\nBut let me confirm the roles. Looking at the table's first column: role names. There are 10 different roles listed:\n\n1. gomez addams\n2. morticia addams\n3. uncle fester\n4. grandma addams\n5. wednesday addams\n6. pugsley addams\n7. lurch\n8. mal beineke\n9. alice beineke\n10. lucas beineke\n\nSo there are 10 roles. Therefore, each cast needs at least 10 people to cover all roles. The original Lima cast has 11, which is more than enough, while the original Broadway cast has exactly 10.\n\nNow, checking the \"original broadway cast\" column:\n\n- gomez addams: nathan lane\n- morticia addams: bebe neuwirth\n- uncle fester: kevin chamberlin\n- grandma addams: jackie hoffman\n- wednesday addams: krysta rodriguez\n- pugsley addams: adam riegler\n- lurch: zachary james\n- mal beineke: terrence mann\n- alice beineke: carolee carmello\n- lucas beineke: wesley taylor\n\nThat's 10 people, each listed under their respective roles. So the original Broadway cast has exactly 10 people to cover 10 roles.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct. The original Lima cast has 11 people for 10 roles, while the Broadway cast has 10 people for 10 roles.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data. The original Lima cast has 11 individuals listed across 10 roles, whereas the original Broadway cast has exactly 10 individuals for the same number of roles.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"summary\": \"The original Lima cast has 11 members for 10 roles, while the original Broadway cast has 10 members for 10 roles.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"gomez have be play by 8 different actor.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that for the role of \"Gomez,\" there are eight different actors who played him across various productions or casts listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, under the \"gomez addams\" column, each row lists an actor. My task is to count how many unique actors are listed here because if it's 8, then the claim holds; otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nLet me list out all the actors under \"gomez addams\":\n\n1. Nathan Lane - original broadway cast\n2. Roger Rees - closing broadway cast\n3. Douglas Sills - original us tour cast\n4. Jesse Sharp - original nonequity tour cast\n5. Daniel Boaventura - original s\u00e3o paulo cast\n6. Diego Bertie - original lima cast\n\nWait, that's only six actors listed here. The claim says eight different actors. So if there are only six unique actors for \"Gomez,\" the claim is false.\n\nI should check if I missed any. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Original broadway: Nathan Lane\n- Closing broadway: Roger Rees\n- Original us tour: Douglas Sills\n- Original nonequity tour: Jesse Sharp\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo: Daniel Boaventura\n- Original Lima: Diego Bertie\n\nThat's six. So the total number is less than eight. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, to support this conclusion, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each row under \"gomez addams\" corresponds to a different production or cast. So all these cells (row 0 through row 5) should be considered relevant because they list the actors who played Gomez.\n\nSo, in JSON format, each cell's row index is from 0 to 5, and the column name is \"gomez addams.\" Each of these six cells needs to be listed as relevant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" with all six cells marked as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gomez addams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gomez addams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gomez addams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gomez addams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gomez addams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gomez addams\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"there be 1 season lurch have 3 people available to play.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n- \"There be 1 season\": This implies that there is exactly one season where Lurch has three actors available.\n- \"Lurch have 3 people available to play\": So, for this particular season, Lurch's role is played by three different individuals.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if there's any row labeled \"lurch\" and see how many cast members are listed in that row. The table has multiple rows, each representing a character from the show, and under each character, there are several cast names associated with original productions like Broadway casts, tours, etc.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for Lurch. Scanning through the table headers:\n\n- Gomez Addams\n- Morticia Addams\n- Uncle Fester\n- Grandma Addams\n- Wednesday Addams\n- Pugsley Addams\n- Lurch\n- Mal Beineke\n- Alice Beineke\n- Lucas Beineke\n\nSo, Lurch is the 7th row. Now, I'll check how many actors are listed under \"Lurch\" in any of the productions mentioned.\n\nLooking at the \"lurch\" row:\n\n| role             | original broadway cast   | closing broadway cast   | original us tour cast   | original nonequity tour cast   | original s\u00e3o paulo cast                             | original lima cast                     |\n|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| lurch            | zachary james            | zachary james           | tom corbeil             | dan olson                      | rog\u00e9rio guedes                                      | gustavo mayer                          |\n\nWait, in the original table, under \"original nonequity tour cast\", it says \"dan olson.\" But looking closer, I notice that for Lurch's row, there are only two actors listed: Zachary James and Tom Corbeil. Also, Dan Olson is listed under \"original nonequity tour cast,\" but in the context of the table, each cell corresponds to a specific production.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the table structure provided by the user, each role has six columns corresponding to different productions. So for Lurch, we have:\n\n- original broadway cast: zachary james\n- closing broadway cast: zachary james (same as before)\n- original us tour cast: tom corbeil\n- original nonequity tour cast: dan olson\n- original s\u00e3o paulo cast: rog\u00e9rio guedes\n- original lima cast: gustavo mayer\n\nSo that's six actors listed for Lurch across different productions. But the claim is about \"1 season\" where Lurch has three people available to play. \n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the table. The table might be showing multiple casts for each role across different productions (Broadway, closing Broadway, US tour, etc.). So for each production, there's a cast member.\n\nBut the claim is about one season where Lurch has three actors available. If a \"season\" corresponds to one of these productions, like original Broadway or closing Broadway, then we can check how many actors are listed per season.\n\nLooking at the original and closing Broadway casts:\n\n- Original Broadway: zachary james\n- Closing Broadway: zachary james\n\nSo for both seasons, only one actor is mentioned. The US tour has Tom Corbeil, nonequity tour has Dan Olson, S\u00e3o Paulo has Rog\u00e9rio Guedes, Lima has Gustavo Mayer.\n\nTherefore, across all these productions (which might be considered different seasons), Lurch has only one or more actors per production, but not three in any single season. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to specific tours as separate seasons. For example, original US tour, original nonequity tour, etc., each could be considered a season where Lurch was played by one person. So, there are six different productions listed for Lurch, each with their own actor.\n\nBut the claim says \"1 season\" where three people were available to play Lurch. Since each production (Broadway original, closing Broadway, US tour, etc.) only has one actor each, it doesn't seem like any single season had three actors. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because there's no season where Lurch had three different actors playing him.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if perhaps in some productions more than one actor is listed for Lurch, but from the table provided, each cell under Lurch has only one name per production. For example:\n\n- original broadway cast: nathan lane vs roger rees\nWait, no, that's for Gomez Addams. For Lurch, it's zachary james in both original and closing Broadway casts.\n\nSo, no single production lists three actors for Lurch. Therefore, the claim is false because there isn't a season where Lurch had three people available to play.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there is one season where Lurch has three actors available. However, checking each production listed under \"Lurch,\" it appears only one actor per production (e.g., Zachary James in both original and closing Broadway casts). Since none of the productions list three actors for Lurch, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"lurch\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The name \"bebe neuwirth\" seems to be a person, likely an actress. The term \"play\" probably refers to her role or performance in a production, possibly in a specific cast. The last part is about the \"original lima cast,\" so I think that's referring to a particular group of actors or cast members from Lima, maybe in a production like The Addams Family.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various roles and their corresponding casts for different productions. Each row represents a role, and each column represents a different cast group, such as the original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US tour cast, etc., including the original Lima cast.\n\nMy goal is to find out if Bebe Neuwirth is part of the original Lima cast. So I'll need to look through the table for her name under the \"original lima cast\" column. \n\nI should start by scanning each row in the \"original lima cast\" column. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n1. Gomez Addams: The actors listed are Diego Bertie.\n2. Morticia Addams: Fiorella Rodrigue.\n3. Uncle Fester: Nicol\u00e1s Fantinato.\n4. Grandma Addams: Patricia Portocarrero.\n5. Wednesday Addams: Gina Yangali.\n6. Pugsley Addams: Giuseppino Castellano, Brando Gallesi.\n7. Lurch: Gustavo Mayer.\n8. Mal Beineke: Miguel \u00c1lvarez.\n9. Alice Beineke: Trilce Cavero.\n10. Lucas Beineke: Luis Baca.\n\nI don't see Bebe Neuwirth listed in any of these entries under the \"original lima cast\" column. That suggests that she is not part of that specific cast group.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should also check if she's present in other casts or if there's another row where her name appears. Let me scan through all columns to be thorough.\n\nLooking at each role across all columns:\n\n- Gomez Addams: Bebe Neuwirth isn't listed in any of the cast groups except perhaps nonequity tour? No, looking at the original nonequity tour cast, it's Jesse Sharp. She doesn't seem to be part of that either.\n- Morticia Addams: Her name is Bebe Neuwirth, and she's under the original Broadway cast but not in the Lima cast.\n- Uncle Fester: Kevin Chamberlin in original Broadway, etc., but no mention of her there.\n- Grandma Addams: Jackie Hoffman in both original and closing Broadway casts, but again, not in Lima.\n- Wednesday Addams: Krysta Rodriguez is in the original Broadway cast. Not her.\n- Pugsley Addams: Adam Riegler is listed for original and closing Broadway casts, but no Bebe here.\n- Lurch: Zachary James, same as before.\n- Mal Beineke: Terrence Mann in original Broadway, not Lima.\n- Alice Beineke: Carolee Carmello in original, Heidi Blickenstaff in closing. Not her.\n- Lucas Beineke: Wesley Taylor and others.\n\nSo, across all the roles and their respective casts, Bebe Neuwirth isn't part of the original Lima cast. She is listed under the original Broadway cast for Morticia Addams. Therefore, the claim that she plays in the original Lima cast seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be not actor who play the same role in the opening and closing cast.\" Hmm, let me parse that.\n\nFirst, I think the claim is saying that there are no actors who played the same role in both the original Broadway cast and the closing Broadway cast. So, to check this, I need to compare the \"opening broadway cast\" and \"closing broadway cast\" columns for each role.\n\nLet me look at the table row by row. Each row represents a character, like Gomez Addams, Morticia Addams, etc. For each character, there are two casts: original (opening) and closing.\n\nStarting with 'gomez addams':\n- Original: Nathan Lane\n- Closing: Roger Rees\nNo overlap here, so this role is not repeated.\n\nNext, 'morticia addams':\n- Original: Bebe Neuwirth\n- Closing: Brooke Shields\nDifferent actors again. No repetition.\n\n'Uncle fester':\n- Original: Kevin Chamberlin\n- Closing: Brad Oscar\nNot the same person.\n\n'Grandma Addams':\n- Original: Jackie Hoffman\n- Closing: Jackie Hoffman\nWait a minute, this is interesting. The original and closing casts both have Jackie Hoffman playing Grandma Addams. That's a repetition in the same role across different casts.\n\nSo, for 'grandma addams', both opening and closing cast lists have the same actor. This directly contradicts the claim that \"there be not actor who play the same role in the opening and closing cast.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there exists at least one actor (Jackie Hoffman) who played the same role in both casts.\n\nI should also check if any other roles have the same actor in original and closing. Let's scan through the table quickly:\n\n- 'Wednesday Addams': Krysta Rodriguez (original) vs Rachel Potter (closing) \u2013 different.\n- 'Pugsley Addams': Adam Riegler in both casts.\nWait, so Pugsley also has the same actor. That adds another example.\n\nSimilarly, 'Lurch' is Zachary James in both opening and closing.\n\nSo, multiple roles have the same actors across different casts. But according to the claim, it's stating that \"there be not actor\", which implies none. Since there are multiple examples where actors repeat their roles, the claim is definitely FALSE.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify all cells that are relevant for confirming this. Each row where the opening and closing cast have the same actor in 'grandma addams' and others. Specifically:\n\n- For Grandma Addams: original broadway cast and closing broadway cast.\n- Similarly, Pugsley Addams has both cast columns with the same actor.\n- Lurch also repeats.\n\nBut for the purpose of this claim, since it's about whether there are any actors who played the same role in opening and closing, all these cells where opening and closing have the same person should be considered relevant.\n\nHowever, to answer the question, I need to list the relevant cells that show at least one case where the same actor is in both casts. So, for each row where column_name is \"original broadway cast\" and \"closing broadway cast\", if they share the same actor, those are the relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON response, I should include all rows where these columns have matching actors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be always extra actor available for each role\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that for every role listed in the table, there are additional actors beyond those who have played the role originally. So, I need to check if each role has more than one actor associated with it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a character from The Addams Family, and each column seems to represent different casts\u2014original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US Tour cast, etc. For example, under \"gomez addams\", I see actors like Nathan Lane (original), Roger Rees (closing), Douglas Sills (US tour), Jesse Sharp (nonequity tour), Daniel Boaventura (S\u00e3o Paulo), and Diego Bertie (Lima).\n\nMy task is to check if each character has more than one actor listed in any of the cast categories. If every role has at least two actors across all casts, then the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nI'll go through each row and examine the corresponding columns:\n\n1. **gomez addams**: There are 6 actors listed across different casts. So, definitely more than one.\n2. **morticia addams**: Similarly, 6 actors listed.\n3. **uncle fester**: 5 actors\u2014more than enough.\n4. **grandma addams**: 6 actors\u2014yes.\n5. **wednesday addams**: 5 actors.\n6. **pugsley addams**: The original nonequity tour cast has two names, and others as well, so total more than one.\n7. **lurch**: 6 actors listed.\n8. **mal beineke**: 6 actors\u2014no issue.\n9. **alice beineke**: 5 actors\u2014more than enough.\n10. **lucas beineke**: 6 actors.\n\nWait, but looking closer, some rows might have only one actor in a specific cast category but possibly more overall. However, the claim doesn't specify which cast; it just says \"each role\" should have an extra actor available. So even if a role has multiple casts with two or more actors across any of them, that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut actually, looking at each role's column, do all roles have at least one additional actor beyond their original? For example, take \"pugsley addams\": original is Adam Riegler, closing also Adam Riegler. But in other casts, like nonequity tour, there are two actors (Sam Primack and maybe others). So yes, he has extra actors in the nonequity tour.\n\nWait, but some roles might have only one actor across all columns. Let me check each:\n\n- Gomez Addams: 6 actors\u2014no issue.\n- Morticia Addams: 6\u2014ok.\n- Uncle Fester: 5\u2014ok.\n- Grandma Addams: 6\u2014ok.\n- Wednesday Addams: 5\u2014ok.\n- Pugsley Addams: At least two in nonequity tour\u2014ok.\n- Lurch: 6\u2014ok.\n- Mal Beineke: 6\u2014ok.\n- Alice Beineke: 5\u2014ok.\n- Lucas Beineke: 6\u2014ok.\n\nWait, are there any roles with only one actor listed across all casts? Let me check each:\n\nLooking at the \"original nonequity tour cast\" column for Pugsley Addams: It says \"sam primack\". But in other columns, like original broadway and closing, it's Adam Riegler. So overall, Pugsley has multiple actors across different casts.\n\nWait, but for example, take Mal Beineke: original Broadway is Terrence Mann, closing is Adam Grupper, US tour Martin Vidnovic, nonequity Mark Poppleton, S\u00e3o Paulo Wellington Nogueira, Lima Miguel Alvarez. That's 6, so definitely more than one.\n\nSimilarly, Lucas Beineke has Wesley Taylor (original), Jesse Swenson (closing), Brian Crum (US tour), Bryan Welnicki (nonequity), Beto Sargentelli (S\u00e3o Paulo), Luis Baca (Lima). Six actors.\n\nWait a second\u2014I might have misread. Let me look at each role's total number of actors:\n\nEach row lists multiple actors across different casts, so each character has been portrayed by more than one actor in various productions. Therefore, there are always extra actors available for each role beyond the original. Thus, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"\n    },\n
