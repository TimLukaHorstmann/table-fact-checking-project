    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"episode 4 be the earliest episode number that originally air on June 8, 2008.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts. The key points are:\n\n1. Episode number 4.\n2. It was originally aired on June 8, 2008.\n\nSo, I should look for episodes with these specific attributes in the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: episode, original airdate, timeslot (approx), viewers (millions), nightly rank.\n\nI need to find all episodes that match two conditions:\n\n- Episode number is 4.\n- Original airdate is June 8, 2008.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the first row, episode 1 on May 18, 2008. Doesn't match because it's not episode 4 or aired on June 8.\n\nEpisode 2 is May 25, 2008. Also doesn't match.\n\nEpisode 3 is June 1, 2008. Close date but not June 8, and it's episode 3, not 4.\n\nEpisode 4: Original airdate is June 8, 2008, and it's episode 4. So this matches both conditions.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other episodes that also match these two criteria. Let me continue checking the rest of the table.\n\nEpisode 5 is June 15, 2008\u2014doesn't match June 8. Episode 6: June 22, nope. Episode 7: June 29. No. Episode 8: July 6. No. Episode 9: July 13. No. Episode 10: July 20. No. Episode 11: July 27. No. Episode 12: August 31. No. Episode 13: September 7. No. Episode 14: November 10, 2008\u2014different date and episode number. Episode 15: November 17\u2014same as 14.\n\nSo, only episode 4 matches both the episode number (4) and the airdate (June 8, 2008). Therefore, episode 4 is indeed the earliest episode that originally aired on June 8, 2008.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure there's no other episode with a lower episode number that was aired earlier. But looking at the table, episodes before 4 were in May and early June, so none of them have the airdate of June 8. So yes, episode 4 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 june 2008 be 4.\"\n\nSo, breaking it down, I'm looking for episodes where the original airdate is June 8, 2008. Then, among those, which one has the lowest viewership (smallest viewers in millions). The claim says that this least watched episode has a nightly rank of 4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, original airdate, timeslot, viewers, and nightly rank. I need to find any episodes aired on June 8, 2008.\n\nI'll scan through the \"original airdate\" column for that date. Let me go row by row:\n\n1. Episode 1: May 18, 2008\n2. Episode 2: May 25, 2008\n3. Episode 3: June 1, 2008\n4. Episode 4: June 8, 2008 \u2013 this is our target date.\n5. Episode 5: June 15, 2008\n6. Episode 6: June 22, 2008\n7. Episode 7: June 29, 2008\n8. Episode 8: July 6, 2008\n9. Episode 9: July 13, 2008\n10. Episode 10: July 20, 2008\n11. Episode 11: July 27, 2008\n12. Episode 12: August 31, 2008\n13. Episode 13: September 7, 2008\n14. Episode 14: November 10, 2008\n15. Episode 15: November 17, 2008\n\nOnly Episode 4 has an original airdate of June 8, 2008.\n\nNow, looking at the viewers column for Episode 4: it's 1.364 million viewers.\n\nNext, I need to find out its nightly rank. Nightly rank is likely the rank when the episode aired compared to other episodes on that day. From the table:\n\nLooking at the timeslot, Episodes 1-7 are Sunday 6:30-7:30 pm, Episode 8 shifts to a later time on the same day? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, the timeslots for each episode are as follows:\n\nEpisodes 1-7 and 8 onwards (except 14 and 15) are Sunday 6:30-7:30 pm.\n\nEpisode 14 is Monday 7:30-9:00 pm, and Episode 15 is Monday 7:30-8:30 pm. So, they're on different days.\n\nBut for Episode 4, it's Sunday 6:30-7:30 pm, so all other episodes airing on that day would be in the same timeslot.\n\nSo, I need to determine how many episodes aired on June 8, 2008 (Sunday), which is only Episode 4. So, its nightly rank would depend on that day's performance compared to other episodes of that season.\n\nBut wait, each episode has a nightly rank as per their position in the week. For example, Episode 1 is ranked 5, Episode 2 is 4, etc. But perhaps \"nightly rank\" refers to the rank among episodes airing on the same day.\n\nWait, I think the term might be ambiguous, but in this context, it's more likely that nightly rank refers to the episode's rank when aired each night during the week. So, for example, Episode 1 is ranked 5, which means there were four episodes with lower ratings that week.\n\nBut perhaps I need to clarify: if we consider \"nightly rank\" as how the episode fared on its airdate in terms of viewership compared to other episodes of the same season.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the rank when looking at all episodes, but more likely, it's the rank for that specific day or week.\n\nGiven that, let me look at Episode 4: original airdate June 8, 2008, viewers 1.364 million, and nightly rank of 4.\n\nThe claim is that this is the least watched episode with that airdate, so we need to confirm if it's the lowest viewers among episodes aired on June 8, which it is because only Episode 4 was aired then.\n\nNow, regarding the nightly rank: the claim states that its nightly rank is 4. Looking at the table, yes, Episode 4 has a nightly rank of 4.\n\nSo both conditions are met: it's the least watched (only one to compare) and has a nightly rank of 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant episode's viewers and nightly rank. The only episode on June 8, 2008, has the lowest viewership and a nightly rank of 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"viewers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"nightly rank\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
