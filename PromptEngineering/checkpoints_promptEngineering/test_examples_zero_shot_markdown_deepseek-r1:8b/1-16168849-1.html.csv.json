    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the number of student enrol at st andrew university be 600.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant information about St Andrews University. Let me scan each row in the table.\n\nLooking at the first column, \"institution,\" I see that one of the entries is \"st andrews university\" (lowercase 's'). So that's probably the right institution. \n\nNext, I need to check the \"student enrollment\" number for this institution. In the table, each row has a column named \"enrollment.\" For St Andrews University, looking at its row, under \"enrollment,\" the value is 600. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nWait, but sometimes names can be tricky with capitalization and spelling. The table lists it as \"st andrews university\" which is similar to \"St Andrew's University.\" However, in this case, both are written without the apostrophe in the table, so I think it's safe to consider them the same.\n\nTherefore, since the enrollment number is 600 for St Andrews University, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because the table shows that St Andrew's University has an enrollment of 600 students. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a college team is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"the college team whose nickname be blue hose join the conference in the year 1965.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions a college team with the nickname \"blue hose\" that joined a conference in 1965. So I need to find a row in the table where the nickname is \"blue hose\" and check when they joined the conference.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: institution, location, founded, type, enrollment, nickname, joined, left, and current conference. The nickname column will have the team names, so I'll focus there.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one with \"blue hose\" as the nickname. Scanning down:\n\n- Anderson University: trojans\n- Appalachian State: mountaineers\n- Catawba College: indians\n- Coker College: cobras\n- East Carolina: pirates\n- Elon University: phoenix\n- Guilford College: quakers\n- High Point University: panthers\n- Lenoir-Rhyne: bears\n- Longwood University: lancers\n- Mars Hill College: lions\n- Newberry College: wolves\n- UNC Pembroke: braves\n- Presbyterian College: blue hose\n\nAh, there's one. Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina has the nickname \"blue hose\" and was founded in 1880. Now I need to check when they joined the conference. Looking at their row, the 'joined' year is 1965.\n\nSo the claim says that this team joined the conference in 1965. Checking the table, yes, Presbyterian College joined in 1965. Therefore, the statement seems to be TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The row index for Presbyterian College is 13 (since it's the 14th entry but starts at 0). The columns needed are 'nickname' and 'joined'. So I'll include those as relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table lists various colleges with details like their names, locations, founding years, types, enrollments, nicknames, when they joined and left conferences, and the current conference.\n\nThe claim given is: \"the conference for the college that leave in 1974 , and again in 1989 , be the aac (naia).\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim. It's saying that there's a college which has both a 'left' year of 1974 and another 'left' year in 1989, and when it left, its conference was the AAC (NAIA).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different institution with various details. The columns relevant here are \"joined\" and \"left\", as well as \"current conference\".\n\nSo my task is to find any college that has both 'left' in 1974 and again in 1989. Then check what their current conference is.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Anderson University: left in 2010, only once.\n2. Appalachian State University: left in 1967 and 1996? Wait, looking at the table, it says 'left' as 1967. It also mentions being part of SOCON until 2014 when moving to Sun Belt. So maybe only one 'left' year.\n3. Catawba College: left in 1989, so that's a potential candidate. Let me check if they have another 'left' earlier? No, just 1989 listed.\n4. Coker College: left in 2013.\n5. East Carolina University: left in 1962, and then later moved conferences, but only one 'left' year shown here.\n6. Elon University: left in 1989, so that's another potential. Any earlier? No, just 1989.\n7. Guilford College: left in 1988.\n8. High Point University: left in 1997.\n9. Lenoir-Rhyne University: 'left' years are 1974 and 1989. Ah, this matches the claim. So this is a relevant row because it has both 'left' in 1974 and 1989.\n\nNow, for Lenoir-Rhyne University, their current conference is listed as SAC (from the table). But the claim says AAC (NAIA). So that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The row for Lenoir-Rhyne shows 'current conference' as SAC. So if the claim states they left and are now in AAC (NAIA), that would be incorrect because they're actually in SAC.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while there exists a college that has left in both 1974 and 1989, their current conference isn't AAC (NAIA) but SAC.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"left\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"current conference\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a college is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see what information I need to extract from the table.\n\n1. **College with the nickname \"blue hose\"**: Looking through the 'nickname' column, I scan each row until I find the college that has \"blue hose\". From the table:\n   - Anderson University: trojans\n   - Appalachian State: mountaineers\n   - Catawba College: indians\n   - Coker College: cobras\n   - East Carolina: pirates\n   - Elon University: phoenix\n   - Guilford College: quakers\n   - High Point University: panthers\n   - Lenoir-Rhyne: bears\n   - Longwood University: lancers\n   - Mars Hill College: lions\n   - Newberry College: wolves\n   - UNC Pembroke: braves\n   - Presbyterian College: blue hose (found here)\n   - Queens University: royals\n   - St Andrews University: knights\n   - Western Carolina: catamounts\n\nSo, Presbyterian College is the one with the nickname \"blue hose\".\n\n2. **Joined in 1972**: I need to check the 'joined' year for Presbyterian College. Looking at their row, under 'joined', it's listed as 1965.\n\nWait, that doesn't match 1972. So there might be a discrepancy here. But let me double-check. Presbyterian College joined in 1965 according to the table. So the claim says they joined in 1972, but the table shows 1965. That would make the claim FALSE, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me check again. The 'joined' column for Presbyterian College is indeed 1965. So if the claim states they joined in 1972, that's incorrect.\n\n3. **Member of SAC**: Next, check their current conference. Presbyterian College's current conference is listed as \"big south (ncaa division i)\". The claim mentions \"sac\". However, looking through the table, I see other colleges like Anderson University and Queens University are part of SAC. But Presbyterian College is in the Big South.\n\nSo, according to the table, Presbyterian College joined in 1965, not 1972, and their current conference is the Big South, not SAC. Therefore, both parts of the claim regarding joining year and conference membership are incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting something about the 'joined' column. For example, some colleges have multiple entries in the 'joined' cell, like Lenoir-Rhyne has 1930 , 1985 and left in 1974 , 1989. But Presbyterian College only lists one joined year: 1965.\n\nSo, to confirm:\n\n- Nickname: blue hose (Presbyterian College)\n- Joined: 1965\n- Current conference: Big South\n\nNow, let's look at the claim again: \"the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n- The college with nickname blue hose is indeed Presbyterian College.\n- It joined in 1972? According to the table, they joined in 1965. So that's incorrect.\n- It is a member of SAC? No, as their current conference is Big South.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if any other college has nickname blue hose and meets the criteria. From the table, only Presbyterian College has \"blue hose\" as their nickname. So no, that's unique.\n\nAlso, checking the 'left' column for Presbyterian College: 1972. So they left in 1972. But the claim is about joining in 1972, which is not the same as leaving.\n\nWait, but if a college joined before and then left, can it rejoin later? It's possible, but according to the table, Presbyterian College left in 1972, so their last 'left' year is 1972. So they might have rejoined at some point after that, but looking at the 'joined' column, it shows only 1965 and then no other joined years except for 1988 or later? Wait, actually, Presbyterian College's 'joined' is listed as 1965, and their 'left' is 1972. No further entries, so they left in 1972, perhaps not rejoining again.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they joined in 1972 is incorrect because they actually joined in 1965 and left in 1972.\n\nAdditionally, regarding membership: The claim says they are part of SAC. Looking at the table, colleges like Anderson University, Queens University, etc., are part of SAC, but Presbyterian College is in Big South. So again, that's incorrect.\n\nSo putting it all together, both parts of the claim are false. Therefore, the entire statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made by the user is not supported by the data provided in the table. Upon analyzing each component of the claim:\n\n1. **College with \"blue hose\" nickname**: Identified as Presbyterian College.\n2. **Joining Year**: According to the table, Presbyterian College joined in 1965, not 1972.\n3. **Current Conference Membership**: Presbyterian College is part of the Big South conference, not SAC.\n\nSince both the joining year and conference membership do not align with the claim, it can be concluded that the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Current conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
