    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells that support this decision.\n\nThe claim states: \"the new york city marathon in 1985 be the latest year a competition be held in new york city.\" \n\nFirst, I'll analyze each part of the claim. The key points are:\n1. The event is the New York City Marathon.\n2. It occurred in 1985.\n3. It was the \"latest\" (most recent) year that a competition was held in New York City.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all instances where the venue is New York, United States and check their years. \n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **1984**: New York City Marathon in New York, USA.\n- **1985**: New York City Marathon again in New York, USA.\n- **1986**: European Championships in Stuttgart, West Germany.\n- **1987**: World Championships in Rome, Italy.\n- **1988**: Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea.\n- **1988**: Venice Marathon in Venice, Italy.\n\nNow, focusing on the rows where the venue is New York:\n- 1984 and 1985 are both listed as \"new york city marathon\" held in New York. \n\nThe claim mentions 1985 specifically. To check if it's the latest year, I need to see if any other competitions were held in New York after 1985. From the table, all subsequent years (1986, 1987, 1988) have venues outside of New York except for the second row in 1988, which is the Venice Marathon, not related.\n\nWait, no. The first two rows are about the New York City Marathon, so those are relevant. After 1985, in 1986, 1987, and 1988, there are no other competitions listed with the venue as New York. So the latest year a competition was held in New York City would be 1985 because after that, no other competitions are listed in the table as being held in New York.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the two rows for 1984 and 1985 where the venue is New York.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table, indicating that the New York City Marathon in 1985 was indeed the latest year a competition was held there.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"venice , italy be the venue for note 2:15:24.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: year, competition, venue, position, and notes. Each row corresponds to a specific event with details filled in those columns.\n\nI need to check if there's any row where the venue is \"venice, italy\" and the note matches \"2:15:24.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n1. 1984: new york city marathon in New York, USA. Note is 2:14:53.\n2. 1985: same event, same place, note 2:11:34.\n3. 1986: European Championships in Stuttgart, West Germany. Note is 2:10:57.\n4. 1987: World Championships in Rome, Italy. Note is 2:14:03.\n5. 1988: Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. Note is 2:15:20.\n6. 1988: Venice Marathon in Venice, Italy. Note is 2:15:24.\n\nLooking at the last row, venue is Venice, Italy and note is exactly 2:15:24. So that matches the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim uses \"be\" instead of \"is.\" That might be a grammatical issue, but it doesn't affect the truthfulness since Venice, Italy is indeed the venue for that specific note.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE. Now, to find the relevant cells: I need the row index where venue is Venice and note is 2:15:24.\n\nLooking at the table, the last row (row index 5) has both \"venice , italy\" as the venue and \"2:15:24\" as notes.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include this row's data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table where Venice, Italy is listed as the venue for a note of 2:15:24. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking against this table. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the note record on new york city marathon hold in the year 1986 be 2:15:20.\" Hmm, let's break that down. It seems like they're talking about a specific marathon event in New York City in 1986 and the time recorded for it being 2:15:20.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns: year, competition, venue, position, notes. The rows are from 1984 to 1988, with some competitions repeated.\n\nFirst, let me check if there's a New York City Marathon in 1986. Scanning through, yes, row 2 is 1985 and it's the NYC marathon, but that's 1985, not 1986. Wait, no, looking again: row 0 is 1984, row1 1985, row2 1986 which is European Championships in Stuttgart, so no NYC there. Then row3 is 1987 World Championships in Rome. Row4 is 1988 Olympics in Seoul and Venice Marathon.\n\nSo, the only NYC Marathon entries are in 1984 and 1985, both with times around 2:11:34 to 2:14:53. There's no NYC Marathon in 1986; that year it was the European Championships. So the claim mentions 1986 for NYC Marathon which doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user made a mistake and meant Venice Marathon in 1988? No, because the claim specifically says \"new york city marathon.\" Also, looking at the notes column, in 1986 it's 2:10:57, not 2:15:20. So even if there was an NYC Marathon in 1986, which there isn't, the time wouldn't match.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim refers to a 1986 New York City Marathon with a note of 2:15:20, but according to the table, that's not accurate. There's no 1986 NYC Marathon, and the times for existing entries don't match.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"olympic game hold at venice , italy in 1984 have note 2:10:57\".\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. Let's see:\n\n1. The event is an Olympic Games.\n2. It was held in Venice, Italy.\n3. The year is 1984.\n4. The note associated with it is 2:10:57.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to find any matching entries that fit these criteria. The table has multiple years, competitions, venues, positions, and notes. \n\nI notice that in the year 1984, there are two entries:\n- One for the New York City Marathon in New York, USA.\n- Another entry is \"olympic games\" held in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions Venice, Italy. So, looking through the table, I need to find an Olympic Games event in Venice, Italy in 1984 with a note of 2:10:57.\n\nLooking at each row for 1984:\n- Row 0: New York City Marathon, venue New York, USA. No match.\n- The next Olympic Games entry is in Seoul, South Korea (row 3), but that's in 1988, not 1984.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the Olympic Games entry for 1988 is in Seoul. There's no row in 1984 where the venue is Venice, Italy. So perhaps there isn't an Olympic Games event in Venice, Italy in 1984.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a different competition held in Venice in 1984, like the Venice Marathon. Looking at the table, I see that in 1988, Venice Marathon was held with a note of 2:15:24. But the claim mentions Olympic Games, not a marathon.\n\nWait, maybe there's an error here. Let me check again. The Olympic Games were held in Seoul in 1988, not Venice. So the claim seems to be mixing up two different events: the Olympic Games and the Venice Marathon.\n\nThe claim states that \"olympic game hold at venice , italy in 1984 have note 2:10:57.\" But according to the table, there's no such event in Venice, Italy for the Olympic Games in 1984. The Olympic Games in 1984 were actually held in Los Angeles, USA.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the table:\n\nLooking at each row:\n- 1984: New York City Marathon (venue New York, USA).\n- 1985: Same event.\n- 1986: European Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.\n- 1987: World Championships in Rome, Italy.\n- 1988: Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea.\n- 1988: Venice Marathon in Venice, Italy.\n\nSo, the only time Venice is mentioned is for the Venice Marathon in 1988 with a note of 2:15:24. There's no Olympic Games in Venice, ever, according to this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"olympic game hold at venice , italy in 1984 have note 2:10:57\" is incorrect because there was no Olympic Games in Venice in 1984. The Olympic Games that year were in Los Angeles, and the note for Venice Marathon is in 1988 with a different time.\n\nAdditionally, the note mentioned in the claim (2:10:57) doesn't match any entry from 1984; it's more likely associated with another event or perhaps a typo.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is FALSE because there was no Olympic Games held in Venice, Italy in 1984 with that particular note. The closest related event is the Venice Marathon in 1988, but it doesn't match the year or the competition type.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states an Olympic Games event in Venice, Italy in 1984 with a specific note not supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
