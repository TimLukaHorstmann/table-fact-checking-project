    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Dartmouth College ranking higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen is true based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"It may come as a surprise, but Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen.\" So I need to check their rankings in some measure. Looking at the table, there are four columns that list rankings for each university: world rank by wur (2013), arwu (2013), and qs (2013). Wait, actually, the column headers might be a bit unclear. Let me check again.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing a different university. The columns after \"year established\" are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". Hmm, maybe it's three separate ranking measures: wur, arwu, and qs. Each row has three ranking values.\n\nSo for Dartmouth College (row index 0), the rankings are:\n- wur: 126th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 113th\n\nFor the University of T\u00fcbingen (row index 5), the rankings are:\n- wur: 201 - 225th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 144th\n\nThe claim is about Dartmouth's rank being higher than T\u00fcbingen. So I need to compare their positions in each ranking.\n\nFirst, let's see the \"world rank by the wur\" column. Dartmouth is ranked 126th and T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th. Since 126 is less than 201, that means Dartmouth is higher in the wur ranking.\n\nNext, the \"arwu\" rankings: both are in the 151-200 range. Dartmouth is 151-200th, same as T\u00fcbingen. So they tie here; no difference.\n\nThen the qs ranking: Dartmouth is 113th, and T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Again, 113 is less than 144, so Dartmouth ranks higher in qs as well.\n\nSo considering all three rankings:\n- wur: Dartmouth higher\n- arwu: same rank\n- qs: Dartmouth higher\n\nSince the claim doesn't specify which ranking measure to use, but just says \"ranks higher\", it's comparing across all rankings. But wait, the instructions say to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim is a general statement about Dartmouth being higher than T\u00fcbingen, so I think it refers to at least one of the rankings.\n\nHowever, in the context of such claims, it's common to refer to a specific ranking like QS or ARWU. If we look at the most prominent ones, maybe QS. In that case, Dartmouth is 113th and T\u00fcbingen is 144th, so Dartmouth is higher.\n\nBut let me check all three rankings to be thorough.\n\nIn wur, Dartmouth is 126, T\u00fcbingen is 201-225. So yes, higher.\nIn arwu, same range.\nIn qs, again higher.\n\nSo in all three measures, Dartmouth ranks higher or equal. Since the claim says \"higher\", which implies strictly higher, but arwu has them in the same bracket, so maybe it's considered a tie there. However, since the other two rankings have Dartmouth higher, the overall statement could be considered true because at least one of them is higher.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The claim says \"ranks higher than\", which might imply all three or any single measure. If we consider that in at least one ranking (wur and qs), Dartmouth is higher, then it's true. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen based on the provided table. By examining each relevant ranking:\n\n1. **WUR Ranking**: Dartmouth at 126th vs. T\u00fcbingen at 201-225th. Dartmouth is higher.\n2. **ARWU Ranking**: Both in the 151-200th range, so tied.\n3. **QS Ranking**: Dartmouth at 113th vs. T\u00fcbingen at 144th. Dartmouth is higher.\n\nSince Dartmouth is higher in two rankings and tied in one, the claim that Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen holds true based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the University of Western Australia (UWA) doing better overall than Durham University despite its later establishment is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should look at what the claim is saying. It claims that UWA performs better than Durham University in terms of their rankings across various metrics like wur, arwu, and qs as of 2013. The table provides the world rankings for each university in these categories.\n\nI need to check each ranking metric one by one for both universities.\n\nStarting with the 'world rank by the - wur, 2013' column:\n\n- UWA is ranked around 168th.\n- Durham University is ranked 80th.\n\nSo in this category, Durham does better than UWA. But the claim says UWA does better overall, so this metric alone doesn't support the claim.\n\nNext, 'world rank by arwu, 2013':\n\n- UWA is ranked 91st.\n- Durham is ranked around 201-300th.\n\nHere, UWA is higher (91st) than Durham's 201-300th range. So in this metric, UWA does better.\n\nLastly, 'world rank by qs, 2013':\n\n- UWA is ranked 134th.\n- Durham is ranked 90th.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back: UWA is 134th and Durham is 90th. So again, Durham is higher than UWA here as well.\n\nSo in two out of the three metrics, Durham does better, but in one (aruw), UWA does better. The claim says overall, so I need to consider all metrics together.\n\nBut how to assess 'overall' performance? It depends on how each metric weights. If each is equally important, then since two metrics have Durham higher and one has UWA higher, it's not clear if UWA is \"better overall.\" Without specific weighting information, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is suggesting that despite a later establishment (UWA was established in 1911 vs. Durham in 1832), UWA still performs better in at least one significant metric enough to be considered better overall.\n\nLooking back, UWA's highest ranking is 91st in arwu, which is much better than Durham's 201-300th range. So perhaps the claim is referring to this as the primary factor for their overall performance.\n\nBut the other two metrics (wur and qs) are worse for UWA. However, if establishment date is also considered, but that doesn't impact rankings directly.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. UWA has a higher rank in arwu.\n2. Durham has higher ranks in wur and qs.\n\nThe claim says overall, UWA does better despite being established later. So perhaps it's focusing on the arwu ranking as the main indicator of better performance.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check would be each university's rankings in all three metrics: wur, arwu, qs.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include the row indices and column names for both UWA and Durham.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to compare the rankings of the University of Western Australia (UWA) and Durham University across three metrics. The claim suggests that despite its later establishment, UWA performs better overall than Durham.\n\n1. **world rank by wur (2013)**:\n   - UWA: 168th\n   - Durham: 80th  \n   Durham ranks higher here.\n\n2. **world rank by arwu (2013)**:\n   - UWA: 91st\n   - Durham: 201-300th  \n   UWA ranks higher here.\n\n3. **world rank by qs (2013)**:\n   - UWA: 134th\n   - Durham: 90th  \n   Durham ranks higher here.\n\nSince two metrics favor Durham and one favors UWA, it's not definitive that UWA is better overall without weighting. However, the claim might focus on arwu where UWA excels. Therefore, considering this metric as primary, the claim could be considered TRUE based on UWA's performance in arwu despite its later establishment.\n\nRelevant cells are the rankings for both universities across all three metrics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. It seems like the claim is comparing Queen University of Canada (QUC) against Dartmouth College across three categories mentioned in the table: world rank by wur, arwu, and qs. The claim is stating that QUC has not done as well as Dartmouth in all three.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each university's rankings for these three metrics. So, I need to check each of the three rankings for both universities.\n\nStarting with Dartmouth College (row 0), their world rank by wur is 126th, arwu is 151-200th, and qs is 113th. Now, for QUC (which is Queen University in row 2), their world ranks are: wur 226-250th, arwu 201-300th, and qs 189th.\n\nThe claim is about whether QUC has not done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories. So I need to compare each category one by one.\n\nFor wur: Dartmouth is ranked 126th, which is better (higher) than QUC's 226-250th. So in this category, QUC does worse.\n\nFor arwu: Dartmouth is 151-200th, and QUC is 201-300th. Again, Dartmouth is higher, so QUC is worse here too.\n\nFor qs: Dartmouth is 113th, and QUC is 189th. Again, Dartmouth is better, so QUC does worse.\n\nSo in all three categories\u2014wur, arwu, qs\u2014Queen University of Canada has a lower (worse) ranking than Dartmouth College. Therefore, the claim that \"QUC have not do as well as Dartmouth in all 3 category\" is TRUE because QUC's rankings are indeed lower across all three metrics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"give how it have have a great headstart , university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have not do as well as the other university , overall.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asserting. It seems like the claim is comparing the performance or rankings of universities, specifically mentioning the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany and how it doesn't perform as well as other universities overall.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify the relevant columns that compare university performances. The columns are: members (which lists the universities), country, year established, world rank by wur (2013), world rank by arwu (2013), and world rank by qs (2013).\n\nThe claim is about rankings, so the relevant columns would be \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". The other columns like members, country, and year established don't seem directly related to comparing headstarts or overall performance.\n\nNext, I'll look at each university's rankings in these columns. Let's focus on the University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany) as it's specifically mentioned in the claim.\n\n- World Rank by wur: 201 - 225th\n- World Rank by arwu: 151 - 200th\n- World Rank by qs: 144th\n\nNow, I need to compare these rankings with other universities in the table. The other universities are Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queens University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), and University of Western Australia (Australia). For each of these, I'll check their respective rankings.\n\nComparing T\u00fcbingen's wur rank of 201-225 to others:\n- Dartmouth: 126th\n- Durham: 80th\n- Queens: 226-250\n- Otago: 226-250\n- Western Australia: 168th\n\nT\u00fcbingen's wur rank is lower (worse) than several other universities like Dartmouth, Durham, and Western Australia. However, it's better than Queens and Otago, which are also in the 200s.\n\nLooking at arwu rankings:\n- T\u00fcbingen: 151-200\n- Dartmouth: 151-200\n- Durham: 201-300\n- Queens: 201-300\n- Otago: 189th\n- Western Australia: 91st\n\nHere, T\u00fcbingen is in the same range as Dartmouth and better than others like Durham, Queens, and Otago. It's worse than Western Australia.\n\nFor qs rankings:\n- T\u00fcbingen: 144th\n- Dartmouth: 113th\n- Durham: 90th\n- Queens: 189th\n- Otago: 155th\n- Western Australia: 134th\n\nT\u00fcbingen is lower (worse) than Dartmouth, Durham, Queens, and Western Australia.\n\nNow, the claim says that T\u00fcbingen \"have not do as well as the other university , overall.\" The term \"do as well\" suggests similar performance. If a university doesn't perform as well as others, it's either lower in rankings or has worse metrics compared to the average or its peers.\n\nLooking at the table, while T\u00fcbingen's arwu rank is comparable (151-200) with Dartmouth and better than several others, it's still lower than some top performers like Durham and Western Australia. In wur and qs ranks, T\u00fcbingen is below many other universities.\n\nSo, does this support that T\u00fcbingen has not done as well as the others? It seems that in some rankings, T\u00fcbingen isn't as high as others, but it's also not at the very bottom either. The claim says they haven't \"do as well,\" which could mean their overall performance is lagging behind other universities.\n\nHowever, considering that T\u00fcbingen's arwu ranking is 151-200, which is still higher than Queens and Otago, and comparable to Dartmouth, it might not be as bad as the claim suggests. But in wur and qs, it's lower, so there's a mix of performance.\n\nThe key here is to see if the overall trend supports the claim that T\u00fcbingen hasn't performed as well as others. Since in some rankings they are worse but not the worst, it might still be considered that they haven't matched up as well as their peers. Therefore, the claim could be TRUE if it's asserting that T\u00fcbingen is lagging behind other universities in overall performance.\n\nThe relevant cells would be the three ranking columns for T\u00fcbingen: world rank by wur, arwu, and qs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that UWA does better in all rankings than Durham University despite its later date of establishment.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. There are six rows, each representing a university with details like country, year established, and three different world rankings from 2013: wur, arwu, qs.\n\nThe claim is making two main points:\n1. UWA does better in all rankings than Durham.\n2. Despite UWA being established later than Durham.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that UWA was established in 1911, while Durham University was established in 1832. So yes, UWA is indeed established later. That part checks out.\n\nNow for the rankings:\n- World ranking by wur: Durham is ranked between 80th, and UWA is 168th.\nWait, so if lower numbers are better, then 80th is better than 168th. So in wur ranking, Durham does better than UWA.\nBut the claim says UWA does better in all rankings, which would mean that UWA's wur rank is better (lower) than Durham's. But according to the table, Durham has a lower wur rank, so this part of the claim might not hold.\n\nNext, world ranking by arwu: Durham is 201-300th and UWA is 91st. So again, lower number means better. So Durham's arwu rank is worse (higher number) than UWA's. So in arwu, UWA does better.\n\nLastly, world ranking by qs: Durham is 90th and UWA is 134th. So again, UWA is ranked higher (lower number). So UWA does better here too.\n\nWait, so for wur ranking, UWA is worse than Durham. But the other two rankings (aruw and qs), UWA is better.\n\nSo the claim says \"does better in all ranking\" which would require that in all three rankings, UWA has a lower number than Durham. However, in wur, it's higher. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely true because in one of the rankings, UWA does worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that UWA is better in some rankings despite being established later.

So for each university, we have their rank in each of these three rankings for 2013.\n\nThe claim is about comparing Dartmouth College's ranks to the University of T\u00fcbingen. So I need to find their respective ranks in each ranking.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Dartmouth College (USA) has wur rank of 126th, arwu rank of 151-200th, and qs rank of 113th.\n- University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany) has wur rank of 201-225th, arwu rank of 151-200th, and qs rank of 144th.\n\nNow, the claim is about whether Dartmouth College has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen in any ranking. So I need to compare their rankings in each category.\n\nLet's look at each ranking:\n\n1. **wur (2013):** Dartmouth is 126th, T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th. So Dartmouth is higher here because 126 < 201.\n2. **aruw (2013):** Both are ranked in the 151-200 range. Dartmouth is 151-200th and T\u00fcbingen is also 151-200th. So their positions within that range might matter, but since they're both in the same range, it's unclear if one is higher than the other without exact positions.\n3. **qs (2013):** Dartmouth is 113th, T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Again, 113 < 144, so Dartmouth is higher here.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"never rank higher\" implies that in all rankings, Dartmouth never was above T\u00fcbingen. But looking at wur and qs, Dartmouth is higher, but arwu they are both in the same range without clear ordering.\n\nHowever, the way the table presents the ranks might be such that lower numbers mean better rankings (higher rank). So for example, 1st is the best, so 126th is worse than T\u00fcbingen's 201-225th? Wait no, wait. If 1 is the highest rank, then a lower number is better. So 126 is higher (better) than 201.\n\nSo in wur ranking: Dartmouth at 126 vs T\u00fcbingen at 201-225. Since 126 < 201, Dartmouth is higher.\n\nIn qs ranking: Dartmouth at 113 vs T\u00fcbingen at 144. Again, 113 < 144, so Dartmouth higher.\n\nBut for arwu, both are in 151-200. Without specific positions, it's unclear if one is higher than the other. However, usually, if two universities are in the same range without exact order, they might be considered equal or it's not determinable from the data provided.\n\nSo does the claim hold true? It says Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. If in any ranking, Dartmouth was higher than T\u00fcbingen, then the claim is false because the statement would not be entirely accurate.\n\nLooking at wur and qs rankings, Dartmouth is higher. Therefore, the claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher is false because, in these two rankings, they did rank higher. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says \"have never rank higher than,\" meaning that in all cases, T\u00fcbingen was better or equal. But since in wur and qs Dartmouth is higher, the statement isn't true because Dartmouth does rank higher in some areas.\n\nYes, so the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we compare Dartmouth College's rankings with those of the University of T\u00fcbingen across all three metrics provided. \n\n1. **wur 2013:** Dartmouth at 126 vs. T\u00fcbingen at 201-225 (Dartmouth higher).\n2. **aruw 2013:** Both in 151-200 range; exact positions unknown.\n3. **qs 2013:** Dartmouth at 113 vs. T\u00fcbingen at 144 (Dartmouth higher).\n\nSince Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen in two metrics, the claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "queen university of canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim says: \"queen university of canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that Queen University of Canada performed better than Dartmouth College across all three categories: world rank by wur (2013), world rank by arwu (2013), and world rank by qs (2013).\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to identify where Queen University of Canada and Dartmouth College are listed. \n\nStarting with Dartmouth College:\n- It's in row 0, columns: country (usa), year established (1769), and the three rankings.\n\nQueen University of Canada is next. Wait, looking back at the table, it lists \"queens university\" (without the \"of canada\") as one of the institutions. Hmm, that might be a typo or perhaps the actual name is different. But according to the table, Queen's University is listed in row 2 with country canada.\n\nSo, I need to compare Queen's University of Canada against Dartmouth College in all three ranking categories for 2013.\n\nLooking at their rankings:\n- For world rank by wur, 2013: \n  - Dartmouth College is ranked 126th.\n  - Queen's University is ranked 226-250th. So, Queen's is lower than Dartmouth here.\n\n- For world rank by arwu, 2013:\n  - Dartmouth is in the 151-200th range.\n  - Queen's is also in the 201-300th range. Wait, but that means Queen's is ranked lower than Dartmouth since 151-200 is better than 201-300.\n\nWait no, actually, a lower numerical value means higher rank. So if Dartmouth is 151-200 and Queen's is 201-300, Dartmouth is ranked higher (better) in arwu.\n\n- For world rank by qs, 2013:\n  - Dartmouth: 113th.\n  - Queen's: 189th. Again, Dartmouth is better here as well.\n\nSo comparing all three categories: wur (Queen lower), arwu (Dartmouth better), qs (Dartmouth better). Therefore, in two out of three rankings, Dartmouth does better, and in one (wur), Queen is higher. Since the claim states that Queen has done better than Dartmouth in all three, this is not true.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the exact wording. The claim says \"have do better\" which might mean \"have done better,\" i.e., past performance. The rankings are from 2013, so it's about their performance in 2013.\n\nSo Queen did better than Dartmouth only in wur, but not the other two. Therefore, the claim is false because it's claiming all three, which isn't the case.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare Queen University of Canada (row 2) with Dartmouth College (row 0) across the three ranking columns for 2013.\n\n1. **wur**: Queen ranks 226-250th, while Dartmouth is 126th. Dartmouth performs better here.\n2. **arwu**: Dartmouth is ranked 151-200th, whereas Queen falls into 201-300th. Dartmouth is higher (better).\n3. **qs**: Dartmouth is 113th, and Queen is 189th. Again, Dartmouth ranks higher.\n\nSince Queen does not outperform Dartmouth in all three rankings, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "durham university have the second - best rank , ie , 80th , in the world rank by - wur 2013 category",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Durham University is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"Durham University have the second - best rank, ie, 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" I think there might be a typo with the \"- wur\" part; it should probably be \"QS World University Rankings\" or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure. But based on the table, I can see that each university has rankings under three categories: world rank by wur, arwu, and qs.\n\nLooking at the columns in the table, there's a column named \"world rank by - wur, 2013\". The dash might be a typo or formatting issue, but it seems like it refers to the QS World University Rankings. So, I'll assume that's correct for now.\n\nNext, I need to find Durham University's ranking in this specific category. Scanning through the table, I see each row corresponds to a university and its respective rankings across the three categories. Let me go down each row until I find \"Durham University\".\n\nUpon finding it, the data for Durham University is: country=UK, year established=1832, world rank by wur 2013=80th. So, their rank in the world rank by wur category is 80th.\n\nNow, the claim says that Durham University has the second-best rank (which would be 2nd) or specifically mentions the 80th position. Wait, the term \"second - best\" is a bit confusing. It could mean the second highest or second in order, but 80th is much lower than that.\n\nIn the table, looking at the world rank by wur column for all universities: Dartmouth has 126th, Durham 80th, Queens 226-250th, Otago 226-250th, T\u00fcbingen 201-225th, and Australia 168th. So, the highest rank in this category is actually 80th (Durham), followed by T\u00fcbingen at 201-225th, then others.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because lower numbers indicate better rankings. So, if Durham is ranked 80th, that's higher than the others listed, which might be 201 or above. So, in this category, Durham has the best rank (1st) in terms of being the highest numbered position, but usually, lower numbers mean better. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, higher numerical ranks are worse. For example, if a university is ranked 1st, that's the best. So in this case, the table shows the rank as \"80th,\" which would be quite good because it's a lower number. Wait, but looking at the other entries: T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th, which is worse than 80th. So Durham is actually higher (better) ranked in wur 2013.\n\nBut the claim says that they have the second-best rank, i.e., 80th. That would mean there's a university ranked higher than them. Looking at the table again: no other universities are listed with a better rank than 80th in the world rank by wur category. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's not the second best but the best.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"world rank by - wur\" refers to something else, like another ranking system where 80th isn't as good as others. But based on standard QS rankings, lower numbers are better. So if Durham is at 80th, that's very good, possibly top 100. The claim says they have the second-best rank, which would imply there's a university ranked higher than them. However, in this table, no other university has a better rank (lower number) than 80th in that category.\n\nWait, let me double-check: the column is \"world rank by - wur, 2013\". So, for example, Dartmouth is 126th, which is worse than Durham's 80th. T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th, which is worse. Queens and Otago are also worse. Australia is 168th, still worse. So in the world rank by wur category, Durham University is actually the best-ranked among all listed here.\n\nTherefore, the claim that says they have the second-best rank (80th) is incorrect because they are actually first. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Durham University has the second-best rank of 80th in the world rank by wur category. However, upon examining the table, Durham University's ranking of 80th is the highest among all listed universities in this specific category. Since no other university has a better (lower) rank than 80th here, Durham actually holds the top position, not the second. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by - wur , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have rank the worst in every single ranking",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim that \"University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany have rank the worst in every single ranking\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It lists various universities along with their country, year established, and three different world rankings from the year 2013: wur, arwu, and qs. The claim is specifically about the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany's performance in all these rankings.\n\nI need to check each ranking for the University of T\u00fcbingen. Let's look at their positions:\n\n1. **wur**: According to the table, they are ranked 201 - 225th.\n2. **aruw**: They're placed 151 - 200th.\n3. **qs**: Their rank is 144th.\n\nNow, understanding what \"worst\" means here. The worst rank would be the lowest position, i.e., a higher numerical value, since lower numbers indicate better performance (e.g., 1st is better than 100th). So, if they are ranked last in all three categories, that's worse.\n\nLooking at each ranking:\n- **wur**: They're at 201 - 225th. Since this range includes the worst position for wur.\n- **aruw**: They're at 151 - 200th, which also covers the lower end of arwu rankings.\n- **qs**: They are ranked 144th, which is within the lower tier of qs.\n\nHowever, each ranking's \"worst\" would mean the highest number in their respective ranges. For example:\n- In wur, the worst is around 225th, so being at 201 - 225th does place them as some of the lowest.\n- Similarly, in arwu, the worst is 300th, and T\u00fcbingen is at 151 - 200th, which is worse than 151st but not all the way to 300th. There might be universities ranked lower (higher numbers) in this category.\n- For qs, being 144th means they are among the lowest, but again, there might be others ranked below them.\n\nWait, actually, if the ranking is \"151 - 200th\" for arwu, that's worse than say 101 - 150th. So yes, they're in the lower half of arwu rankings, which could mean they are among the worst. Similarly for qs, 144th is quite low.\n\nBut does \"worst in every single ranking\" mean they are the absolute last in each? Or just within their respective categories?\n\nLooking at other universities:\n- Dartmouth College: wur 126th, arwu 151-200, qs 113th.\n- Durham University: wur 80th (which is better than T\u00fcbingen's), arwu 201-300, qs 90th.\n- Queens University: wur 226-250, arwu 201-300, qs 189th.\n- University of Otago: wur 226-250, arwu 201-300, qs 155th.\n- T\u00fcbingen: wur 201-225, arwu 151-200, qs 144th.\n\nSo in wur, T\u00fcbingen is at 201-225. Let's see other universities:\n- Queens and Otago are also 226-250, which is worse than T\u00fcbingen's 201-225.\nBut wait, no\u2014wait, 201-225 is higher (worse) than 226-250 because 201 is lower than 226. So being at 201-225 in wur means they're ranked between 201st and 225th, which are worse than those who are 126th or 80th.\n\nWait, but the term \"worst\" could be ambiguous. If a ranking goes from best (1st) to worst (highest number), then higher numbers mean worse performance. So in wur, T\u00fcbingen is ranked 201-225. That's worse than universities ranked 126th or 80th.\n\nSimilarly, arwu: 151-200 is worse than 201-300, but better than being at 201-300. Wait no\u2014higher numbers are worse, so 151-200 is better (lower numbers) than 201-300.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nIn rankings, lower numerical values mean better positions. So a university ranked 1st is the best, and one ranked 100th is worse than one ranked 50th.\n\nSo for each ranking:\n- wur: 126 (Dartmouth), 80 (Durham), 226-250 (Queens, Otago), 201-225 (T\u00fcbingen), 168 (Australia).\nThe worst in wur would be the highest number. T\u00fcbingen is at 201-225, so their worst possible rank in wur is 225th. Is that worse than others? Yes, because other universities have lower ranks.\n\nWait no\u2014wait, Dartmouth is 126th, which is better (lower) than T\u00fcbingen's 201-225. So T\u00fcbingen's wur ranking is worse than Dartmouth's. Similarly, T\u00fcbingen is worse than Durham's 80th and the University of Australia's 168th.\n\nIn arwu: T\u00fcbingen is 151-200. So their worst possible rank in arwu is 200th. Other universities have lower ranks (better): Queens is 201-300, which is worse than T\u00fcbingen's 151-200.\n\nWait, so in arwu, T\u00fcbingen is ranked 151-200, meaning they are better than Queens and Otago, who are at 201-300. So in arwu, T\u00fcbingen is not the worst; Queens and others have worse ranks.\n\nSimilarly, qs: T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Let's compare to others:\n- Dartmouth: 113th (better)\n- Durham: 90th (much better)\n- Queens: 189th (worse than T\u00fcbingen)\n- Otago: 155th (worse than T\u00fcbingen)\n- Australia: 134th (better)\n\nSo in qs, T\u00fcbingen is worse than Queens and Otago but better than Dartmouth, Durham, and Australia.\n\nNow, the claim is that T\u00fcbingen has the worst rank in every single ranking. From the above analysis:\n\n- In wur, T\u00fcbingen's 201-225 is worse than several others (like 80th or 126th).\n- In arwu, their 151-200 is better than some others (Queens at 201-300), so they aren't the worst in arwu.\n- In qs, they are 144th, which is worse than Queens and Otago but better than others.\n\nTherefore, T\u00fcbingen isn't last (worse) in every ranking. They are worst in wur and qs compared to some, but not all.\n\nSo the claim that they have the worst rank in every single ranking is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany\" has the worst rank in every single ranking (wur, arwu, qs), we check each relevant cell:\n\n1. **wur**: 201-225th - Worse than some but not all.\n2. **aruw**: 151-200th - Better than Queens and Otago.\n3. **qs**: 144th - Worse than Queens and Otago but better than others.\n\nSince T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst in every ranking, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"Determine if 'University of T\u00fcbingen' has the worst rank in all rankings.\",\n  \"results\": {\n    \"wur\": {\"position\": \"201-225\", \"worst_in_ranking\": false},\n    \"aruw\": {\"position\": \"151-200\", \"worst_in_ranking\": false},\n    \"qs\": {\"position\": \"144\", \"worst_in_ranking\": false}\n  },\n  \"conclusion\": {\n    \"statement\": \"'University of T\u00fcbingen' does not have the worst rank in every single ranking.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"They are worse than some but not all, specifically in wur and qs compared to others like Queens and Otago.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
