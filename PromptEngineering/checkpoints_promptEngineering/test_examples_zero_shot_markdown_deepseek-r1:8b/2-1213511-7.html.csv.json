    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the toronto maple leaf of bemidji state university (wcha) draft a player from the united state.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Let's see what columns are relevant here. We have \"pick,\" \"player,\" \"position,\" \"nationality,\" \"nhl team,\" and \"college/junior/club team.\"\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: \n1. The player is a Toronto Maple Leaf from Bemidji State University (WCHA).\n2. They drafted someone from the United States.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any players who fit these criteria. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with pick 93: The player is Bruce Abbey. His position is left wing, nationality is Canada. He plays for the Toronto Maple Leafs and his college team is Bemidji State University (WCHA). Hmm, that fits the first part\u2014player name isn't mentioned in the claim, but he's a Toronto Maple Leaf from Bemidji State (WCHA).\n\nNow, check if Bruce Abbey was drafted from the United States. His nationality is Canada, so he wasn't drafted from the US. That doesn't support the claim.\n\nMoving on to other picks: There's Dale Smedsmo at pick 93? Wait, no\u2014pick 93 is Bruce Abbey. Next, looking for a player who plays for the Toronto Maple Leafs and was drafted from the US. \n\nLooking through the table, most players are Canadian except Bill Green (US) and Steve Johnson (Canada). But none of them play for the Toronto Maple Leafs except Bruce Abbey and Dale Smedsmo. Wait, Dale Smedsmo is at pick 93 as well? No, pick 93 is Bruce Abbey. Let me check again.\n\nWait, pick 93: player is Bruce Abbey, position left wing, nationality Canada, NHL team Toronto Maple Leafs, college Bemidji State (WCHA). So he's a Canadian player who was drafted by the Maple Leafs from his college team. Since he's Canadian, he wasn't drafted from the US.\n\nAre there any other players who fit? Let me see pick 97: Jean-Denis Royal is a defender, nationality Canada, plays for NY Rangers, and his college team is Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (QMJHL). Not relevant.\n\nPick 98: Steve Johnson, position defence, nationality Canada, NHL team Toronto Maple Leafs, college Verdun Maple Leafs (QMJHL). So he's also Canadian, no US draft involved.\n\nLooking at the other players, none of them are from the US and play for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Therefore, there's no player in the table that fits both criteria: playing for Toronto Maple Leafs and being a US draft pick.\n\nSo the claim is false because even though Bruce Abbey is a Toronto Maple Leaf from Bemidji State (WCHA), he's Canadian, not an American draft.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because none of the players listed as Toronto Maple Leafs were drafted from the United States. The only player fitting the NHL team and college team description is Canadian.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 93, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 93, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 93, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 93, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 93, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the new york ranger draft defender saint - j\u00e9r\u00f4me alouettes (qmjhl)\". My task is to verify each part of this claim against the table and see if all conditions are met.\n\nI'll start by identifying the key components in the claim:\n\n1. **New York Ranger**: This refers to an NHL team, so I should look for teams associated with the New York Rangers.\n2. **Draft**: This implies that the player was selected in a draft, likely the NHL Entry Draft.\n3. **Defender**: The player's position is defense.\n4. **Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (qmjhl)**: This seems to be a reference to a college/junior team where the player played before the draft.\n\nNow, I'll go through each column in the table to find matching information.\n\nStarting with the \"player\" column, I'm looking for players named Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me. However, in the table, under \"player\", there's a name listed as \"jean - denis royal\". The spacing and hyphenation might be different, but it seems like this could be a variation of \"Jean-Denis Royal\".\n\nNext, let's check the \"position\" column. For this player, position is defence, which matches the claim.\n\nLooking at the \"nhl team\" column for \"jean - denis royal\", it says \"new york rangers\". That aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nThe \"college / junior / club team\" for this player is listed as \"saint - j\u00e9r\u00f4me alouettes (qmjhl)\". This directly matches the second part of the claim, confirming that he played for that team before the draft.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm whether Jean-Denis Royal was indeed drafted by the New York Rangers. Since the table doesn't list a specific draft number or year, but it does show that \"new york rangers\" is his NHL team, and since the table represents the 1998 NHL Draft (as some players in this range include those from 1998), it's reasonable to conclude he was drafted by them.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies between the claim and the information in the table. All parts of the claim are supported by corresponding cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 97,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 97,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 97,\n      \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 97,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"Bemidji State University have a player of Canadian nationality drafted by the Toronto Maple Leaf.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific things: the player's college/junior/club team and their nationality.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where Bemidji State University is listed as the college/junior/club team. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 85: Winnipeg Jets (WCHL)\n- Row 86: Michigan Technological University (WCHA)\n- Row 87: University of Notre Dame (NCAA)\n- Row 88: Harvard University (ECAC)\n- Row 89: Clarkson University (ECAC)\n- Row 90: Sherbrooke Castors (QMJHL)\n- Row 91: Peterborough Petes (OHA)\n- Row 92: Regina Pats (WCHL)\n- Row 93: Bemidji State University (WCHA) \u2192 This is the one.\n- Row 94: Regina Pats (WCHL)\n- Row 95: Oshawa Generals (OHA)\n- Row 96: Ottawa 67's (OHA)\n- Row 97: Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (QMJHL)\n- Row 98: Verdun Maple Leafs (QMJHL)\n\nSo, the player associated with Bemidji State University is in row 93. Now, checking the nationality for that player.\n\nIn row 93, the nationality is \"United States.\" The claim says the player is Canadian. That's a discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, the team drafted by should be Toronto Maple Leafs. Looking at row 93, the NHL team is Toronto Maple Leafs. So that part matches.\n\nBut since the nationality doesn't match\u2014player is US, not Canada\u2014the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 93, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"}, {\"row_index\": 93, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}]}",
