The claim is: \"during the johnson v moraga event there be 2.4 million viewers.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the event that matches \"johnson vs moraga.\" Scanning down, I see a row where the event is listed as \"johnson vs moraga\" with the date july 27, 2013. That's the relevant event.\n\nNext, I check the viewers column for this specific event. The number there is 2.4 million, which matches exactly what the claim states. So, the viewers figure is accurate.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. Each row has columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers. For the \"johnson vs moraga\" row, I need to note the row index and the corresponding column names that contain the data checked. That means the viewers column (row 7) is definitely relevant. The event column (row 0) might not be directly relevant because it's just confirming the event name, but since the claim includes both the event name and the number of viewers, I think both columns are necessary to fully verify the claim. So, row 7 for viewers and row 0 for event.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim is true because the viewers figure matches. The relevant cells are the event column for the specific event and the viewers column with the 2.4 million number.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what's required.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with several columns: event, date, rating, share, and viewers. The claim mentions \"Johnson v Dodson,\" which should correspond to one of the events in the table. \n\nI need to find that specific row in the table. Let me scan through each row's event name:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos\n2. evans vs davis\n3. diaz vs miller\n4. shogun vs vera\n5. henderson vs diaz\n6. johnson vs dodson\n7. henderson vs melendez\n8. johnson vs moraga\n\nYes, the sixth row is \"johnson vs dodson.\" Now, I should check the \"rating\" column for this event. The rating is 2.4.\n\nSo, the claim says that at this event, the rating is 2.4, which matches exactly what's in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking back at the instructions, the \"relevant_cells\" should be a list of objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" \n\nThe event row is the sixth one, so row_index is 5 (since we start counting from 0). The column we're looking at is \"rating,\" so each relevant cell will have row_index=5 and column_name=\"rating.\"\n\nI should make sure to only include this specific cell in the list. So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rating\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"At the shogun v vera event, the rating be 1.4 and the viewer be 2.4 million.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It's in markdown format with columns like event, date, rating, share, viewers. Each row corresponds to a different event.\n\nI should start by locating the specific event mentioned in the claim. The event is \"shogun vs vera.\" Looking through the table rows:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos\n2. evans vs davis\n3. diaz vs miller\n4. shogun vs vera\n5. henderson vs diaz\n6. johnson vs dodson\n7. henderson vs melendez\n8. johnson vs moraga\n\nSo, the fourth row is the \"shogun vs vera\" event. Now, I need to check the rating and viewers for this event.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\n- Rating: 1.4\n- Viewers: 2.4 million\n\nThat matches exactly what the claim states. The rating is indeed 1.4 and the viewers are 2.4 million.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Sometimes tables can have discrepancies or formatting issues, especially with how the markdown is structured. In this case, each row seems clearly separated, and \"shogun vs vera\" is unambiguously in the fourth row.\n\nTherefore, both the rating and viewers' numbers for that event align perfectly with the claim. There's no conflicting information or missing data here.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. Locate the row where the event is \"shogun vs vera.\" This is the fourth row (index 3) in the table.\n2. Check the \"rating\" column for this row, which is 1.4.\n3. Check the \"viewers\" column for this row, which is 2.4 million.\n\nBoth pieces of information match the claim exactly.

The claim mentions \"johnson v moraga,\" \"july 27, 2013,\" and a rating of 1.5.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Velasquez vs Dos Santos**: November 12, 2011 - rating is 3.1\n2. **Evans vs Davis**: January 28, 2012 - rating is 2.6\n3. **Diaz vs Miller**: May 5, 2012 - rating is 1.5\n4. **Shogun vs Vera**: August 4, 2012 - rating is 1.4\n5. **Henderson vs Diaz**: December 8, 2012 - rating is 2.5\n6. **Johnson vs Dodson**: January 26, 2013 - rating is 2.4\n7. **Henderson vs Melendez**: April 20, 2013 - rating is 2.2\n8. **Johnson vs Moraga**: July 27, 2013 - rating is 1.5\n\nLooking for \"Johnson vs Moraga\" event on July 27, 2013. The table shows that this event indeed has a rating of 1.5 in the \"rating\" column.\n\nNow, to map the relevant cells: the row index where \"Johnson vs Moraga\" occurs is 7 (since it's the 8th entry, but rows are zero-indexed). So row_index should be 7, and the column is \"rating.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data, making it TRUE.

Let me examine each row one by one.\n\nThe table has several columns: event, date, rating, share, and viewers. So I'm looking for a row where the date is December 8, 2012, and the viewers column matches 4.4 million.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Velasquez vs dos santos - November 12, 2011: Not our date.\n2. Evans vs davis - January 28, 2012: Not December, so no.\n3. Diaz vs miller - May 5, 2012: Earlier than December, so not relevant.\n4. Shogun vs vera - August 4, 2012: Again, earlier date.\n5. Henderson vs diaz - December 8, 2012: This is the exact date mentioned in the claim. Now check the viewers column. It says 4.4 million. That matches perfectly.\n\nSo this row directly supports the claim. I don't need to check further because only one relevant row is found.\n\nWait, are there any other rows with December 8, 2012? Let me scan again. The next events after Henderson vs diaz are in 2013, so no, there's only that one row for December 8, 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the viewers column of that specific row.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"viewers of Johnson vs Moraga.\" Looking at the table headers: event, date, rating, share, viewers. So the relevant column here is \"viewers.\"\n\nNext, I need to find the specific row where the event is \"Johnson vs Moraga.\" Let me scan through each row's event name.\n\n- The first row after the header is Velasquez vs Dos Santos.\n- Second: Evans vs Davis.\n- Third: Diaz vs Miller.\n- Fourth: Shogun vs Vera.\n- Fifth: Henderson vs Diaz.\n- Sixth: Johnson vs Dodson. Wait, that's different from what the claim says. The claim says \"Johnson vs Moraga.\" Hmm, so I need to check if there's a row with exactly \"Johnson vs Moraga\" as the event.\n\nContinuing down:\n- Seventh row: Henderson vs Melendez.\n- Eighth row: Johnson vs Moraga. Yes! That's the one.\n\nNow, I need to look at the \"viewers\" column for this specific event. From the table, the viewers for Johnson vs Moraga is 2.4 million.\n\nThe claim says that the viewers are \"above 3 million.\" So, is 2.4 million above 3 million? No, it's actually below. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm not missing any other possible rows or misinterpreting the event names. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Velasquez vs Dos Santos: viewers are 5.7M\n- Evans vs Davis: 4.7M\n- Diaz vs Miller: 2.4M\n- Shogun vs Vera: 2.4M\n- Henderson vs Diaz: 4.4M\n- Johnson vs Dodson: 4.2M\n- Henderson vs Melendez: 3.7M\n- Johnson vs Moraga: 2.4M\n\nSo, only the last row matches \"Johnson vs Moraga\" with viewers at 2.4M.

The claim says, \"the event henderson v melendez take place before april 20 , 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the relevant row for this event. Let's see, the table has several events listed with their respective details. Scanning each row:\n\n1. velasquez vs dos santos\n2. evans vs davis\n3. diaz vs miller\n4. shogun vs vera\n5. henderson vs diaz\n6. johnson vs dodson\n7. henderson vs melendez\n8. johnson vs moraga\n\nLooking for \"henderson v melendez,\" I find it in row 7, which is the 8th event in the list (since we start counting from 0). The date for this event is April 20, 2013.\n\nThe claim states that this event took place before April 20, 2013. But wait, the date listed in the table is exactly April 20, 2013. So if the event took place on that very day, does \"before\" apply? Typically, something happening \"before\" a specific date doesn't include the same day as the start date. \n\nSo, in this case, since the event is on April 20, it's not before that date. Therefore, the claim should be considered FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to identify which columns and rows are relevant for verification. The key columns here are \"event\" because we're checking the specific event name, and \"date\" because we're comparing whether it occurred before a certain date.

The claim says, \"the johnson v moraga fight take place just after july 27 , 2013 and have a rating of close to 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts: the date and the rating. Let's look at each part.\n\nStarting with the date. The claim mentions that the fight took place \"just after july 27, 2013.\" In the table, I need to find the row for \"johnson vs moraga\" and check its date. Scanning through the rows, I see that there is a fight between Johnson and Moraga on July 27, 2013. Wait, but the claim says it took place just after that date. However, in the table, the date listed is exactly july 27, 2013, not after. So does \"just after\" mean the same day or the next? If the event happened on the 27th, then saying it's just after would be accurate because the exact date matches.\n\nNext, looking at the rating. The claim states that the fight has a rating of close to 1. Checking the table again for the Johnson vs Moraga row, the rating is listed as 1.5. So \"close to 1\" might be a bit off because it's actually 1.5. That seems like a significant difference from 1, but maybe depending on context, it could be considered close. However, numerically, 1.5 is not that close to 1; there's a half point difference.\n\nSo, for the date part, the claim aligns with the table's data as both mention July 27, 2013. But regarding the rating, while the table states 1.5, the claim says it's close to 1. This seems like a discrepancy because 1.5 is more than just close to 1\u2014it's halfway between 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, even though one part of the claim matches the table exactly, the other part does not. So the overall claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze both the date and rating mentioned in the claim against the corresponding entries in the table.\n\n1. **Date Analysis**: The claim states that the Johnson vs Moraga fight took place just after July 27, 2013. According to the table, this event indeed occurred on July 27, 2013, matching the claimed date exactly.\n   \n2. **Rating Analysis**: The claim asserts a rating close to 1. The table lists the rating as 1.5 for this fight, which is not considered \"close to 1\" as it represents a significant difference.\n\nGiven that one part of the claim does not align with the table's data, the overall claim is deemed FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rating\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the number of viewers for the fight on December 8, 2012 was over 4.4 million.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the event that happened on December 8, 2012. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nThe first event is Velasquez vs Dos Santos on November 12, 2011. That's not the date we're looking for.\n\nSecond event: Evans vs Davis on January 28, 2012. Nope, that's January.\n\nThird: Diaz vs Miller on May 5, 2012. Not December.\n\nFourth: Shogun vs Vera on August 4, 2012. Still not December.\n\nFifth: Henderson vs Diaz on December 8, 2012. Oh, this is the one we need to check.\n\nSo the fifth row has the event Henderson vs Diaz with a date of December 8, 2012. The viewers for that fight are listed as 4.4 million.\n\nThe claim states that the number of viewers was over 4.4 million. But according to the table, it's exactly 4.4 million. So \"over\" would mean more than 4.4 million, right? Therefore, 4.4 million isn't over 4.4 million; it's equal.\n\nWait, but sometimes in language, \"over\" can be a bit tricky. Let me think about it again. If something is exactly 4.4 million, does that count as being over? No, because over implies more than the given number. So in this case, since the viewers are exactly 4.4 million, the claim that they were over isn't true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The event is Henderson vs Diaz at row index 5 (since it's zero-indexed?), or wait, looking back, the first row is index 0. Let me check the table again.\n\nWait, the user provided a markdown table with events and dates. Each row corresponds to one event. So the fifth row in the table is Henderson vs Diaz, which would be at row_index 5? Or does it start from zero? Let me count:\n\n1. Velasquez vs Dos Santos - row 0\n2. Evans vs Davis - row 1\n3. Diaz vs Miller - row 2\n4. Shogun vs Vera - row 3\n5. Henderson vs Diaz - row 4\n6. Johnson vs Dodson - row 5\n7. Henderson vs Melendez - row 6\n8. Johnson vs Moraga - row 7\n\nSo the fifth event is Henderson vs Diaz, which is at row index 4.\n\nLooking at the columns, we need to check the \"viewers\" column because that's what the claim refers to. So the relevant cells are at row_index 4 and column_name \"viewers.\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"viewers\"}.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the number of viewers for the fight on December 8, 2012 was over 4.4 million. By checking the table, we find that the event Henderson vs Diaz occurred on December 8, 2012 with 4.4 million viewers.
