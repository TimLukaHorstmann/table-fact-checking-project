    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a match is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"in the match against valentijn overeem , the method use to win be submission via achilles lock.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any matches where the opponent's name is Valentijn Overeem. Let me go row by row.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"record,\" the opponent, method used, event, round, and location. I'll scan each row for the opponent column:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is Gary Goodridge\n- Row 1: Opponent is Mindaugas Kulikauskas\n- Row 2: Opponent is Andrey Juravkov\n- Row 3: Opponent is Stanislav Nuschik\n- Row 4: Opponent is Islam Dadalov\n- Row 5: Opponent is Ant\u00e3nio Rodrigo Nogueira\n- Row 6: Opponent is Vepcho Bardanashvili\n- Row 7: Opponent is Valentijn Overeem\n- Row 8: Opponent is Vyacheslav Kiselyov\n- Row 9: Opponent is Lee Hasdell\n- Row 10: Opponent is Zabir Elbiev\n- Row 11: Opponent is Denis Shibankov\n\nSo, the opponent in row 7 is Valentijn Overeem. Now I need to check what method was used in that match.\n\nLooking at column \"method\" for row 7: It says \"submission (achilles lock).\" The record shows a win with a score of 4 - 1. \n\nThe claim states the method used was a submission via achilles lock. From the table, that's exactly what happened in that match against Valentijn Overeem.\n\nSo, the claim is fully supported by the data in row 7, column \"method.\" Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"moscow , russia be the location of the match that result in a win by tko\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if there's any match where the location is Moscow, Russia and the method was TKO with a win.\n\nI'll go through each entry:\n\n1. The first row: res is loss, so not relevant.\n2. Second row: win by decision, no TKO.\n3. Third row: loss by decision, not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: win by Tko (cut), location is Russia but not Moscow specifically. It just says russia, not sure if it's Moscow or another city in Russia. But the claim mentions \"moscow , russia\", so maybe this isn't the one.\n5. Fifth row: loss, nope.\n6. Sixth row: loss by submission, no.\n7. Seventh row: win by tko (cut), location is Russia but again, not specified as Moscow. It just says russia, which could be any city in Russia.\n8. Eighth row: win by submission, but the method isn't TKO.\n9. Ninth row: loss by tko, so no.\n10. Tenth row: win by tko (cut), location is Russia but not Moscow.\n11. Eleventh row: win by tko (kick), location is Tokyo, Japan. So that's a win in Tokyo, not Moscow.\n12. Twelfth row: win by submission, method isn't TKO.\n\nWait, looking back, the tenth row has a location of russia, but it's for a loss. The seventh row also says russia, but no specific city. The twelfth row is moscow, russia, and the result is win, but the method is submission (strikes). So none of these have a TKO method in Moscow, Russia.\n\nWait, maybe I missed one. Let me check again:\n\n- 7th row: Ekaterinburg, russia, tko (cut), win.\n- 10th row: Russia, tko (kick), win, but no city specified beyond russia.\n- Eleventh row: Tokyo, Japan, tko (kick), win.\n\nSo none of the rows with TKO wins specify Moscow, Russia as the location. Most just say russia without specifying the city. Only the twelfth row is moscow, but it's a submission, not TKO. \n\nTherefore, there's no match in the table that results in a TKO win specifically in Moscow, Russia.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that there is a match in Moscow, Russia resulting in a TKO win. After reviewing each row, no such entry exists where both 'TKO' and 'Moscow, Russia' are present as conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the event bar - moscow v st petersburg last 2 round.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Event**: It refers to a specific fight event. Here, the event is named \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg.\"\n2. **Last 2 rounds**: This likely means that there were two consecutive rounds in which this event took place.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight record with details like the outcome (win/loss), the opponent's name, the method of victory or loss, the event name, the round number, and the location.\n\nI need to find any fights where the event is \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\" and check if there are two consecutive rounds recorded for this event.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- **Row 4**: The event is listed as \"bars - moscow vs st petersburg,\" but it's written in a way that might be a typo. However, the round number here is 2.\n  \nWait, I notice that some event names have spaces and hyphens differently. For example, row 6 has \"rings : king of kings 2000 block a\" and others like that. So perhaps there's a specific format to match.\n\nLooking back at the claim, it specifies \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg.\" In the table, row 4 shows \"bars - moscow vs st petersburg\" with round 2. Then, looking further, I see another row where the event might be similar.\n\nWait, in row 7, the opponent is mindaugas kulikauskas, and the method is decision, but the event name is \"rings lithuania : bushido rings 3.\" That doesn't match.\n\nGoing back to row 4: the event is \"bars - moscow vs st petersburg\" in column 'event' with round 2. Is there another entry for this event with a consecutive round number?\n\nLooking at other rows, I don't see another instance of \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg.\" Wait, perhaps row 4 is the only one, so it has only one round (round 2). The claim mentions \"last 2 rounds,\" implying that there should be two rounds. Since there's only one in the table, this would make the claim false.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed another occurrence. Scanning through all rows again:\n\n- Row 4: bars - moscow vs st petersburg, round 2\n- Any others? No, each event seems unique with different opponents and methods.\n\nSo if there's only one round for this event, the claim about \"last 2 rounds\" isn't supported. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the event \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\" occurred in the last two rounds. Upon reviewing the table, there is only one entry for this event (round 2), lacking a second consecutive round to support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"the match when the record be 2 - 1 end with the method of tko via a kick.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions two main things:\n1. The match occurs when the record is 2 - 1.\n2. The method used in that match is a TKO (Technical Knockout) via a kick.\n\nSo, my task is to find in the table if there's any row where the \"record\" column has \"2 - 1\" and the \"method\" is described as a TKO via a kick.\n\nLet me look at each row of the table one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: res is loss, record is 7-5. Doesn't match.\n2. Row 1: win, 7-4. No.\n3. Row 2: loss, 6-4. No.\n4. Row 3: win, 6-3. No.\n5. Row 4: loss, 5-3. No.\n6. Row 5: loss, 5-2. No.\n7. Row 6: win, 5-1. Hmm, record is 5-1. Not 2-1.\n8. Row 7: win, 4-1. No.\n9. Row 8: win, 3-1. No.\n10. Row 9: loss, 2-1. Record matches part of the claim, but what's the method? It says \"tko (kick)\". Wait, that's a TKO via kick. So this row has record 2-1 and method tko (kick).\n11. Row 10: win, 2-0. No.\n12. Row 11: win, 1-0. No.\n\nSo, in Row 9, the \"record\" is 2 - 1 and the \"method\" is tko via a kick. Therefore, this matches both parts of the claim.\n\nI need to check if any other rows also have record 2-1 with TKO via kick.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about a specific match is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"the round in which be the match bar - moscow v st petersburg be in the 3\". Hmm, that seems a bit unclear at first glance. Maybe it's saying that the match between \"bar\" (I think they mean something else here, perhaps a fighter's name?) Moscow vs St. Petersburg was in round 3.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location. So each row represents a different fight with details about the result, opponent, etc.\n\nI need to find any matches where the event is \"bar - moscow v st petersburg\". Let me scan through the 'event' column:\n\n1. pride 21\n2. rings lithuania : bushido rings 3\n3. bars - bars\n4. bars - moscow vs st petersburg\n5. iafc - pankration russian championship 2001\n6. rings : king of kings 2000 block a\n7. rings : russia vs georgia\n8. rings russia : russia vs the world\n9. iafc - pankration world championship 2000\n10. rings : king of kings 1999 block a\n11. iafc - pankration russian championship 1999\n12. iafc - pankration european championship 1998\n\nLooking for \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\" in the 'event' column: Yes, it's there at row index 3 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). So that's the fourth row if starting from 1.\n\nNow, let's check the 'round' column for that event. The 'round' value is 2, as per the table. So the match was in round 2, not round 3.\n\nThe claim says it was in round 3, but according to the table, it was in round 2. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"bar - moscow v st petersburg\" match was in round 3, but the table shows it was in round 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"the round do the match go to when tko ( kick) be 1\". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I think it means when there's a TKO (Technical Knockout) in the match, which happens at round 1. So the claim is about matches where the opponent was defeated by TKO in the first round.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. The 'res' column shows whether it's a win or loss for the fighter. The 'method' column tells us how the match ended\u2014like decision, TKO, submission, etc.\n\nThe task is to check if all matches where the result was a TKO occurred in round 1. So I need to find all rows where 'method' is TKO and then see what their 'round' value is.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. loss (7-5) vs Gary Goodridge: method is decision, so not relevant.\n2. win (7-4): method is decision\u2014no.\n3. loss (6-4): method is decision\u2014nope.\n4. win (6-3): TKO? No, it's a tko in the event description? Wait, no\u2014the 'method' here is tko for one of the wins. Let me check: the fourth row shows 'win', method is tko. So that should be considered. What round was this? Round 2. But the claim says TKO should be in round 1.\n\nWait, so if a match ended with TKO but in round 2, then the claim would be false because it's not all going to round 1.\n\nContinuing:\n\n5. loss (5-3): method is decision\u2014no.\n6. loss (5-2): method is submission (armbar)\u2014so no TKO here.\n7. win (5-1): submission via achilles lock\u2014method isn't TKO, so no.\n8. win (4-1): also a submission\u2014no.\n9. win (3-1): submission again\u2014nope.\n10. loss (2-1): method is tko\u2014so this is another TKO match. What's the round? Round 2 again.\n\n11. win (2-0): tko via cut\u2014method is tko, so check round: it's round 1 here.\n\n12. win (1-0): submission\u2014no.\n\nSo from the table, I see that some matches ended with TKO but not all in round 1. Specifically:\n\n- Row 4: Round 2\n- Row 10: Round 2\n\nThese are TKO methods but not in round 1. Therefore, the claim that \"the round do the match go to when tko (kick) be 1\" is incorrect because there are TKO matches in other rounds besides round 1.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, I need to find which cells are relevant. The 'method' column for these rows is where it matters.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 4: method is tko\n- Row 10: method is tko\n\nAnd their respective round values are 2 and 2.\n\nSo the relevant columns are 'method' for these rows.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check all matches where the result was a TKO (Technical Knockout) to see if they occurred in round 1. From the table:\n\n- Row 4: TKO in Round 2\n- Row 10: TKO in Round 2\n\nSince there are TKOs outside of Round 1, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, I need to check the \"opponent\" column for \"Valentijn Overeem\". \n\nScrolling through each row:\n\n- The first row has the opponent as Gary Goodridge.\n- Second row: Mindaugas Kulikauskas.\n- Third row: Andrey Juravkov.\n- Fourth row: Stanislav Nuschik.\n- Fifth row: Islam Dadalov.\n- Sixth row: Antanio Rodrigo Nogueira.\n- Seventh row: Vepcho Bardanashvili. Hmm, this one's opponent is Vepcho Bardanashvili, but the method is submission (achilles lock).\n- Eighth row: Valentijn Overeem.

The claim says: \"in ekaterinburg , russia , the match be kept when the result be a win and they use the tko method.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three things: location (Ekaterinburg, Russia), the result being a win, and the method used being TKO (Technical Knockout). So I need to check if there's any match in the table that meets all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. I'll go through each row to see if any match the claim.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. The first row: loss, so result isn't a win. Skip.\n2. Second row: win, but location is Lithuania. Doesn't match Ekaterinburg. Skip.\n3. Third row: loss. Skip.\n4. Fourth row: win, location is Ekaterinburg, Russia. Let's check the method. It says \"submission (achilles lock)\". TKO isn't mentioned here. So doesn't meet all criteria.\n5. Fifth row: loss. Skip.\n6. Sixth row: loss. Skip.\n7. Seventh row: win, location is Ekaterinburg, Russia. Method is submission (achilles lock) again. Not TKO.\n8. Eighth row: win, but opponent is Vyacheslav Kiselyov and result is 3-1. Wait, looking back at the table, actually, I might have miscounted. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, let's list all the rows with wins:\n\nLooking for res as \"win\":\n\nRow 1: loss\nRow 2: win (method decision, location Lithuania)\nRow 3: loss\nRow 4: win (submission, Ekaterinburg)\nRow 5: loss\nRow 6: loss\nRow 7: win (submission, Ekaterinburg)\nRow 8: win (opponent Valentin Overeem, submission, Ekaterinburg)\nWait, no, actually row 7 is:\n\n| win | 3 - 1 | vyacheslav kiselyov | submission (armbar) | iafc - pankration world championship 2000 | 1 | moscow , russia |\n\nSo that's in Moscow. Row 4 and 7 are in Ekaterinburg.\n\nLooking back, row 4: win, opponent Stanislav Nuschik, method tko? Wait no, the method is \"tko\"? Let me check:\n\nNo, row 4 says \"method\" is tko? Wait, looking at the table, for row 4:\n\n| win | 6 - 3 | stanislav nuschik | tko | bars - moscow vs st petersburg | 2 | moscow , russia |\n\nWait no, that's incorrect.

The table shows for row 4:\n\n| win | 6 - 3 | stanislav nuschik | tko | bars - moscow vs st petersburg | 2 | moscow , russia |\n\nWait, that's in Moscow, not Ekaterinburg. So I need to correct my earlier mistake.\n\nLooking for wins in Ekaterinburg:\n\nRow 4: location is Moscow\nRow 7: location is Ekaterinburg\nRow 8: opponent Valentin Overeem, location Ekaterinburg\nWait, no, row 8 says:\n\n| win | 3 - 1 | vyacheslav kiselyov | submission (armbar) | iafc - pankration world championship 2000 | 1 | moscow , russia |\n\nSo that's in Moscow.\n\nNow looking for wins in Ekaterinburg with TKO method.\n\nLooking at row 4: opponent Stanislav Nuschik, location Moscow. Method tko, but not in Ekaterinburg.\n\nRow 7: win, location Ekaterinburg, but method is \"submission (achilles lock)\".\n\nWait, no TKO there. So I'm looking for a fight that's a win, in Ekaterinburg, with TKO method.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- Row 4: Moscow, tko\n- Row 7: Ekaterinburg, but submission\n- Row 8: Ekaterinburg? Wait no, row 8 is Moscow.

Since none are found, the answer would be that no such fight exists.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all rows:\n\nLooking for res='win' AND location 'Ekaterinburg' AND method='tko'.\n\nRows with 'Ekaterinburg':\n\nRow 4: Moscow\nWait, perhaps I misread.
