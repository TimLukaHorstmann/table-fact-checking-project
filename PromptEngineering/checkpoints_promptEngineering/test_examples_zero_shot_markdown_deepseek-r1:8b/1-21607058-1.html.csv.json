    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"On June 3, the rider ranked 12th has a time of 18'19.47 and a speed of 123.539 mph.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n- Date: June 3\n- Rider's rank: 12th\n- Time: 18'19.47 (which is 18 minutes and 19.47 seconds)\n- Speed: 123.539 mph\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different rider with their times for each day from June 1 to June 5. The columns are \"mon 1 june\", \"tue 2 june\", \"wed 3 june\", etc.\n\nSince the claim is about June 3, I need to focus on the column labeled \"wed 3 june\". Next, I should locate the rider ranked 12th in the table. Scanning through, I see that Ryan Farquhar is rank 12, so his row is important here.\n\nLooking at Ryan Farquhar's times:\n- June 1 (mon): \"-- no time\"\n- June 2 (tue): \"18'36.60 121.644 mph\"\n- June 3 (wed): \"18'19.47 123.539 mph\"\n- June 4 (thurs): \"17'58.92 125.893 mph\"\n- June 5 (fri): \"17'51.75 126.734 mph\"\n\nSo, for June 3 (the column we're interested in), Ryan Farquhar has a time of exactly 18'19.47 and a speed of 123.539 mph. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I examined the table for June 3 and checked the rider ranked 12th, which is Ryan Farquhar. His time on June 3 matches the claim, as does his speed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"wed 3 june\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Ryan Farquhar is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the rider Ryan Farquhar, on a 1000cc Kawasaki, have no time list for Tuesday, 2 June.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate Ryan Farquhar in the table. Looking at the 'rider' column, I see his name is listed as row 12. His motorcycle is a 1000cc Kawasaki, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check what happened on Tuesday, 2 June for Ryan Farquhar. The columns are labeled from Monday (1 June) to Friday (5 June). So Tuesday would be the second column in the table. \n\nLooking at row 12 under Tuesday, I see the entry is \"-- no time.\" This means that there's no recorded time for Ryan Farquhar on Tuesday, 2 June.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct based on the data provided. The relevant cell is the one in row 12 and column \"tue 2 june.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tue 2 june\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
