    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"south melbourne's home score against lake oval be 8.18 (66)\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at each column in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim mentions \"south melbourne\" as the home team, so I should focus on the row where the home team is south melbourne. Looking at the table, there's a row with home team 'south melbourne' in the fourth row (row index 4). \n\nNext, it mentions \"lake oval\" as the venue. In that same row, the venue column shows 'lake oval', so that matches.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to the home score of south melbourne against lake oval. So I need to check the \"home team score\" column for south melbourne when they played at lake oval. According to the table, in row 4, the home team score is listed as 8.18 (66).\n\nPutting this together, all the relevant cells are: row index 4, home team score.\n\nI should make sure there's no other information needed. The claim doesn't mention anything about the away team or crowd, so those columns aren't necessary here. Only the home team and their score are relevant to verify the claim.\n\nSo the relevant_cells will include the home team's row index and column name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"when south melbourne be the away team , their score be be 8.18 (66) when they play at lake oval.\" \n\nFirst, I need to carefully check each part of this claim against the provided table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim has two main parts: \n1. South Melbourne is the away team.\n2. Their score is 8.18 (66) when they play at Lake Oval.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find rows where the home team and away team are relevant to this claim.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to South Melbourne being the away team and playing at Lake Oval. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about Hawthorn (home) vs St Kilda (away) at Glenferrie Oval. Not relevant because it's not South Melbourne.\n\n2. Second row: North Melbourne (home) vs Geelong (away) at Arden Street Oval. Again, not relevant.\n\n3. Third row: Melbourne (home) vs Carlton (away) at MCG. No match here either.\n\n4. Fourth row: Footscray (home) vs Richmond (away) at Western Oval. Not our team.\n\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne is the home team playing Essendon away at Lake Oval. Wait, in this case, South Melbourne is the home team, not the away team. So that might not be relevant unless we need to check the venue and score when they're the home team, but the claim specifies South Melbourne as the away team.\n\n6. Sixth row: Fitzroy (home) vs Collingwood (away). Not our teams either.\n\nHmm, so in the table, I only see one instance where South Melbourne is the home team against Essendon on July 24, 1954, at Lake Oval. But the claim says when they are the away team. So perhaps that row isn't directly matching the claim because it's their home game, not away.\n\nWait a second, maybe I missed another row. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n- The fifth row has South Melbourne as home vs Essendon at Lake Oval with a score of 8.18 (66) for South Melbourne and 13.8 (86) for Essendon.\n- The claim says when South Melbourne is away, their score is 8.18 (66). So I need to find if there's another row where South Melbourne is the away team with that score at Lake Oval.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\nI don't see any other instance of South Melbourne being the away team. In fact, in the fifth row, they're the home team. The claim doesn't mention them as the home team; it specifies when they are away. So perhaps there's no such row where South Melbourne is the away team with that score at Lake Oval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if any other team has South Melbourne as their opponent when they (South Melbourne) scored 8.18 (66). But looking at the table:\n\nIn the fifth row, it's South Melbourne scoring 8.18 at Lake Oval against Essendon. So if another team is playing away at Lake Oval and their score is 8.18, but that would require another row where South Melbourne is the home team.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim states that when South Melbourne is the away team, their score is 8.18 (66) at Lake Oval. To confirm this, there must be a match in the table where:\n\n- South Melbourne is the away team.\n- Their score is 8.18 (66).\n- The venue is Lake Oval.\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n- In the fifth row: South Melbourne is home vs Essendon away at Lake Oval. So the venue matches, but they are the home team here.\n\nIs there any other match where South Melbourne is away and their score is 8.18 (66) at Lake Oval? Let's check all rows:\n\nRow 0: Hawthorn vs St Kilda at Glenferrie \u2013 not relevant.\nRow1: North Melbourne vs Geelong at Arden Street \u2013 nope.\nRow2: Melbourne vs Carlton at MCG \u2013 no.\nRow3: Footscray vs Richmond at Western Oval \u2013 no.\nRow4: South Melbourne is home against Essendon away at Lake Oval. So they are home here, not away.\n\nRow5: Fitzroy vs Collingwood \u2013 no relevant.\n\nSo, in the table, there's only one match involving South Melbourne at Lake Oval, and that's when they're the home team. There's no instance where they're the away team with a score of 8.18 (66) at Lake Oval.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because South Melbourne isn't listed as the away team in any row with that score at Lake Oval.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"when they play at footscray the home team 's score be 818 (66)\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a game played at Footscray where the home team scored 8.18 (66). So I need to find in the table a match that is hosted by Footscray (home team) with their score being exactly 8.18 (66).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" and \"venue.\" \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is Hawthorn, venue is Glenferrie Oval. Not Footscray.\n2. **Row 1**: Home team is North Melbourne, venue Arden Street Oval. Not Footscray.\n3. **Row 2**: Home team is Melbourne, venue MCG. Not Footscray.\n4. **Row 3**: Home team is Footscray, venue Western Oval. This matches the venue mentioned in the claim.\n   \nNow, checking the \"home team score\" for this row: It's listed as 6.9 (45). That doesn't match 8.18 (66) at all.\n\nSo, there's no match in the table where Footscray is the home team playing at Western Oval and scored 8.18 (66). Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks for a game at Footscray where the home team scores 8.18 (66). The only row with Footscray as the home team shows their score as 6.9 (45), not matching the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
