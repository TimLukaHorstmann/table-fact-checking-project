    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"binibining pilipinas - tourism say still not part of bb pilipinas from 1973 thru 1986.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is asserting. It's stating that for the years 1973 through 1986, the \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" category was not part of BB Pilipinas. So, I should check each year in that range and see if there's any data under \"binibining pilipinas - tourism.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: binibining pilipinas - universe, binibining pilipinas - international, miss maja pilipinas, binibining pilipinas - tourism, first runner-up, and second runner-up. The row headers are years from 1973 to 1991.\n\nI need to focus on the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column for each year between 1973 and 1986. Let me go through each year one by one:\n\n- 1973: The cell says \"still not part of bb pilipinas.\" So, it's indicating that in 1973, the Tourism category wasn't part of BB Pilipinas.\n- 1974: Same as above, \"still not part.\"\n- 1975: Same again.\n- 1976: Same.\n- 1977: Same.\n- 1978: Same.\n- 1979: Same.\n- 1980: Same.\n- 1981: Same.\n- 1982: Same.\n- 1983: Same.\n- 1984: Wait, in 1984 there are two entries for \"binibining pilipinas - tourism.\" The first row for 1984 says \"still not part,\" and the second also says \"still not part.\" So both entries confirm it wasn't part.\n- 1985: \"Still not part.\"\n- 1986: \"Still not part.\"\n\nSo, from 1973 to 1986, every single year's tourism category entry indicates that it was not part of BB Pilipinas. This supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all relevant cells in the specified years show that \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" was indeed not part of BB Pilipinas from 1973 through 1986.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we examine each year from 1973 to 1986 and check the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column. Each entry confirms that the Tourism category was not part of BB Pilipinas during these years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"maria luisa jimenez be miss maja pilipinas in 1987 and maria muriel moral the following year.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about Maria Luisa Jimenez being Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1987. The second part says that Maria Muriel Moral was the winner the next year, which would be 1988.\n\nI'll start by looking at the year 1987 row to see who won Miss Maja Pilipinas. From the table, under \"miss maja pilipinas,\" for 1987, it shows \"maria luisa jimenez.\" That matches the first part of the claim, so that's correct.\n\nNext, I'll check the 1988 row to see if Maria Muriel Moral won. Looking at the \"miss maja pilipinas\" column for 1988, the entry is \"maria muriel moral.\" So the second part of the claim also holds true.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

The claim is: \"maria lourdes enriquez win as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions two people: Maria Lourdes Enriquez and Jessie Alice Salones Dixon. The first part says Maria Lourdes Enriquez won the title of \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\". The second part states that this happened in the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixon, who I assume also participated in Binibining Pilipinas.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. I need to find out when Jessie Alice Salones Dixon competed and then check if Maria Lourdes Enriquez won the next year's title. \n\nStarting with Jessie Alice Salones Dixon. I'll scan through the \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" column for her name. In 1986, the international winner is Jessie Alice Salones Dizon (I think it might be a typo in the table as it's listed as salones dixson). So she won in 1986.\n\nNext, Maria Lourdes Enriquez. I'll look for her name in the same column. She appears in 1987 as the winner of Binibining Pilipinas - International. Now, checking the years: if Jessie won in 1986, then Maria should have won in 1987. That makes sense because 1987 comes right after 1986.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that Maria Lourdes Enriquez won in the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixon did. Since Jessie won in 1986 and Maria in 1987, this seems correct.\n\nI should also double-check if there are any other years or titles mentioned in the claim. The claim specifically mentions \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" and doesn't mention any other titles like Miss Maja Pilipinas or First Runner-up, so those can be ignored for this check.\n\nLooking at the table again to confirm the years: Jessie won in 1986, Maria in 1987. The year after is indeed 1987. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1986,\n      \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - international\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1987,\n      \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - international\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"selina manalad and jennette fernando be the first runner-ups when anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez win the binibining pilipinas - universe.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim has two main parts:\n\n1. Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez win the Binibining Pilipinas - Universe.\n2. Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando are the first runner-ups.\n\nI need to verify if, when the first pair wins, the second pair is indeed the first runners-up. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the \"first runner - up\" column because that's directly relevant. The claim mentions specific names in this column, so I'll check their positions.\n\nStarting with 1991, there are two entries because some columns have repeated data due to different categories. For \"first runner - up,\" in 1991, the first entry is Selina Manalad and the second is Jennette Fernando. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The table for 1991 has:\n\n- First runner-up: Selina Manalad\n- Second runner-up: Jennette Fernando\n\nSo when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won in 1991 (as per the claim), the first runners-up were indeed Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando.\n\nWait, no, actually looking again, in the table for 1991:\n\n|   1991 | ... | binibining pilipinas - universe | ... | first runner - up         | second runner - up            |\n|-------:|:----:|---------------------------|:----:|--------------------------|:------------------------------|\n|   1991 | anjanette abayari | maria lourdes gonzalez     | maria lourdes gonzalez | not awarded                      | selina manalad            | jennette fernando         |\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me recheck the table.\n\nWait no, in the table provided, for 1991, under \"binibining pilipinas - universe,\" it's Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez winning? Wait, looking at the columns:\n\nFor 1991, the entries are:\n\n- binibining pilipinas - universe: anjanette abayari\n- binibining pilipinas - international: maria lourdes gonzalez\n\nWait, no. Let me look at each row properly.\n\nIn 1991, the \"binibining pilipinas - universe\" column has Anjanette Abayari, and the \"binibining pilipinas - international\" column has Maria Lourdes Gonzalez. So together, they won in that year. Then, for first runner-up, it's Selina Manalad, and second is Jennette Fernando.\n\nSo when Anjanette Abayari (Binibini Universe) and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez (Binibini International) win, the first runners-up are indeed Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but in 1991, the \"binibining pilipinas - universe\" is Anjanette Abayari, and the \"international\" is Maria Lourdes Gonzalez. So together, they won, making them co-winners. Then, under first runner-up, it's Selina Manalad, and second is Jennette Fernando.\n\nSo yes, that aligns with the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be the row for 1991 in \"first runner - up\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"first runner - up\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start not until the year 1987.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim means. It says that the \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" category did not start until 1987. So I need to check if there was a winner for this category before 1987 or not.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1973 onwards. The columns relevant here are \"binibining pilipinas - tourism.\" Let me look through each row's value for this column.\n\nStarting with 1973: It says \"still not part of bb pilipinas.\" So in 1973, there was no tourism category. Same goes for 1974, 1975, and so on up to 1986. In 1987, the first entry I see is \"marie avon boyle garcia,\" which means that in 1987, someone won the Tourism title.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, I notice there are two entries for 1984 and 1985. For 1984, it's \"still not part of bb pilipinas.\" But then again, 1984 is repeated with another entry, same as 1985? Or maybe that's a typo. Hmm.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is whether the Tourism category started in 1987 or before. From the table, all years before 1987 have \"still not part of bb pilipinas\" except for 1987 and onwards. So up until 1986, there was no Tourism winner. In 1987, it started with a winner named Marie Avon Boyle Garcia.\n\nSo the claim says that Tourism did not start until 1987, which is TRUE because before 1987, there were no winners in that category.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" did not start until 1987.

The claim says: \"binibining pilipinas - tourism say still not part of bb pilipinas from 1973 thru 1988.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's talking about a specific category in the context of Binibining Pilipinas (which I believe is Miss Philippines). The categories mentioned are \"tourism\" and \"bb pilipinas.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1973 to 1991. Each column corresponds to different titles or runners-up, like \"binibining pilipinas - universe,\" \"miss maja pilipinas,\" etc. The specific columns relevant here are:\n\n- binibining pilipinas - tourism\n- binibining pilipinas - universe (though I'm not sure if this is directly related)\n- bb pilipinas\n\nThe claim specifically mentions that from 1973 through 1988, the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" category was still not part of the main Binibining Pilipinas. So I need to check each year from 1973 to 1988 and see what's listed under \"binibining pilipinas - tourism.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For each year starting from 1973, in the column for \"binibining pilipinas - tourism,\" the entries are:\n  - 1973: Still not part of BB Pilipinas\n  - 1974: Same\n  - ...\n  - Up to 1988: Still not part.\n\nSo each year from 1973 to 1988, that column has \"still not part of bb pilipinas.\" That matches the claim exactly. The claim says they were still not part from '73 thru '88, which is exactly what the table shows.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because all the years in that range have that entry.

The claim says: \"Maria Luisa Jimenez be Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1986 and Maria Muriel Moral the following year.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table columns to see which ones are relevant. The table has several columns: binibining pilipinas - universe, binibining pilipinas - international, miss maja pilipinas, binibining pilipinas - tourism, first runner-up, and second runner-up.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific individuals: Maria Luisa Jimenez and Maria Muriel Moral. It also specifies the years 1986 and 1987 respectively. \n\nStarting with 1986, I'll look for Maria Luisa Jimenez in the table under \"miss maja pilipinas.\" Scanning the rows for 1986, I see that the \"miss maja pilipinas\" column has \"maria cristina recto.\" That's not Maria Luisa Jimenez, so maybe she wasn't Miss Maja that year. Alternatively, perhaps her name is misspelled or I'm missing it. Let me double-check the 1986 row.\n\nLooking again at 1986, the universe and international columns are filled with other names, but \"miss maja\" is indeed Maria Cristina Recto. So Maria Luisa Jimenez wasn't Miss Maja in 1986. Hmm, that could mean the claim is FALSE already because she didn't hold that title.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja in 1986 and Maria Muriel Moral the next year. So let's check for Maria Muriel Moral in 1987. In 1987, under \"miss maja pilipinas,\" we see \"maria luisa jimenez.\" Oh, so she was Miss Maja in 1987, not 1986.\n\nWait, that means the claim is incorrect because it says Jimenez was in 1986 and Moral in 1987. But according to the table, Jimenez was Miss Maja in 1987, not 1986. Also, looking at 1986's \"miss maja\" column, it's someone else.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is FALSE because Maria Luisa Jimenez was actually Miss Maja in 1987, and the year mentioned for her is wrong. Additionally, checking if Maria Muriel Moral was ever Miss Maja: looking through the table, in 1988 she is listed under \"miss maja pilipinas\" as maria muriel moral. So she was indeed Miss Maja in 1988.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that Jimenez was Miss Maja in 1986 and Moral in 1987, which doesn't align with the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"miss maja pilipinas\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"miss maja pilipinas\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"maria lourdes enriquez lose as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do\".\n\nBreaking this down, it seems to be saying that Maria Lourdes Enriquez was the Binibining Pilipinas - International winner in a particular year, and the next year (the following year), Jessie Alice Salones Dixon won instead. So essentially, Maria lost the title the year after Jessie won.\n\nWait, no, actually, the claim is phrased as \"maria lourdes enriquez lose as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do\". It might mean that in the year after Jessie won, Maria lost. So perhaps the structure is: In Year X, Jessie won International, and then in Year X+1, Maria was a candidate but lost.\n\nI need to look into the table to find if this scenario occurs.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant rows for both Maria Lourdes Enriquez and Jessie Alice Salones Dixon.\n\nLooking through the \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" column:\n\n- In 1987, the winner was Maria Lourdes Enriquez.\n- In 1986, the winner was Jessie Alice Salones Dixon.\n\nWait, no. Let me check each year:\n\nIn 1973: maria elena ojeda\n1974: erlynne bernardez\n1975: jaye murphy\n1976: maria dolores ascalon\n1977: maria cristina alberto\n1978: luz policarpio\n1979: mimilanie laurel marquez\n1980: diana jeanne christine chiong\n1981: alice sacasas\n1982: maria adela lisa manibog\n1983: flor eden pastrana\n1984: catherine jane brummitt\n1985: sabrina simonette marie artadi\n1986: jessie alice salones dixson\n1987: maria lourdes enriquez\n1988: maria anthea robles\n1989: lilia eloisa andanar\n1990: jennifer pingree\n1991: maria patricia betita\n\nWait, in 1991, both Maria Lourdes Gonzalez and Maria Patricia Betita are listed. So maybe that's the case for 1991.\n\nNow, looking at the claim again: \"maria lourdes enriquez lose as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do\"\n\nSo, if Jessie won in 1986, then in 1987, Maria Lourdes Enriques won. But the claim says that Maria lost the year after Jessie won. So perhaps it's suggesting that in the next year after Jessie (i.e., 1987), Maria was a candidate but lost.\n\nBut according to the table, in 1986, Jessie won, and in 1987, Maria Lourdes Enriques also won. That means both of them were winners in consecutive years, which is possible if there's no overlap or conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is suggesting that after Jessie won, Maria lost in the next year. So perhaps in 1986, Jessie won, and then in 1987, Maria was a candidate but lost, making someone else the winner.\n\nBut looking at the table for 1987: \"maria lourdes gonzalez\" is listed under Binibining Pilipinas - International. Wait, no, in 1987, the winner was maria lourdes enriquez. So both Jessie and Maria were winners in consecutive years, which would mean that the claim's assertion that Maria lost after Jessie won isn't accurate because she actually won.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the table. Let me double-check.\n\nIn 1986: jessie alice salones dixson\nIn 1987: maria lourdes enriquez\n\nSo both are winners in consecutive years, meaning Maria did not lose after Jessie; she won. Therefore, the claim that Maria lost after Jessie is incorrect because Maria actually won the next year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a different context, like Maria losing in the same year as Jessie's win or something else, but based on the table, it seems they are two separate winners.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if both were contestants in their respective years. For example, maybe in 1986, Jessie won, and in 1987, Maria was a contestant but lost to someone else, making her not the winner. But according to the table, in 1987, Maria Lourdes Enriques is listed as the winner. So she actually won, not lost.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because Maria did not lose after Jessie; she won.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"maria lourdes enriquez lose as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do,\" we need to check if Maria lost in the following year after Jessie's win.\n\n1. **Identify the winners:**\n   - In 1986, Jessie Alice Salones Dixon won the Binibining Pilipinas - International title.\n   - In 1987, Maria Lourdes Enriques also won the same title.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both winners are in consecutive years, it's clear that Maria did not lose after Jessie; she actually won the title the next year.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because Maria Lourdes Enriques won in the following year, not lost.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1986,\n      \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1987,\n      \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on this table. The claim is: \"binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start not until the year 1989.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table headers to make sure I'm focusing on the right columns. The relevant column here is \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\". So I need to check all the entries under that column across different years.\n\nLooking through each row for the year 1989 and onwards, I see that in 1989, the entry for binibining pilipinas - tourism is listed as \"marichele cruz\". Before that, from 1973 to 1988, it says \"still not part of bb pilipinas\" except for 1984, which also has the same note. Wait, no, in 1984, it's still \"still not part of bb pilipinas\".\n\nWait a minute, so in 1989, it's awarded to marichele cruz. So prior to that, from 1973 up until 1988, the tourism category wasn't awarded because it says \"still not part of bb pilipinas\". That means that before 1989, there was no tourism award given.\n\nThe claim says that binibining pilipinas - tourism did not start until 1989. So if in 1989 it's the first time, then the claim is true because prior to 1989, they didn't have a tourism category.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In 1990, the entry is \"milagros javelosa\", so that's another year after 1989. So yes, from 1989 onwards, it starts being awarded. Therefore, the claim is accurate because before 1989, it wasn't part of the competition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" category did not start until 1989. By examining the table, we see that entries for this category are marked as \"still not part of bb pilipinas\" until 1989, when it first appears as \"marichele cruz.\" Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1989, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me read through the claim again: \"selina manalad and jennette fernando be the second runner-ups when anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez win the binibining pilipinas - universe.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two winners (anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez) for the \"binibining pilipinas - universe\" title. Then, it states that selina manalad and jennette fernando are the second runner-ups when those two win.\n\nSo I need to check each year's row in the table to see if there is a year where both anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez are listed as winners, and in that same year, selina manalad and jennette fernando are second runner-ups. Alternatively, since in 1991 there are two entries for maria lourdes gonzalez (probably a typo or duplication), I might need to look at both instances.\n\nLooking through the table, each row corresponds to a specific year. Let me go year by year:\n\n- 1973: Winners are maria margarita moran and maria elena ojeda. Second runner-ups are mercedes zabarte and others. No match here.\n- 1974: Winners listed as guadalupe sanchez and erlynne bernardez.\n- ...\n- Moving down, I notice that in 1991 there are two entries for maria lourdes gonzalez. The first row for 1991 lists anjanette abayari as the \"binibining pilipinas - universe\" winner, with maria lourdes gonzalez as a second runner-up? Wait, no: looking at the columns, I think I might have misread earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The table has columns for each year:\n\nColumns are: binibining pilipinas - universe, binibining pilipinas - international, miss maja pilipinas, binibining pilipinas - tourism, first runner-up, second runner-up.\n\nSo in 1991, the first row says:\n\n- binibining pilipinas - universe: anjanette abayari\n- binibining pilipinas - international: maria patricia betita\n- miss maja pilipinas: selina manalad\n- binibining pilipinas - tourism: not awarded\n- first runner-up: jennette fernando\n- second runner-up: anna marie torres\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says when anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez win. But in 1991, maria lourdes gonzalez is not listed as a winner but rather as the \"binibining pilipinas - international\" title. So maybe I need to check if there's another year where both are winners.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nIn 1991, the second row says:\n\n- binibining pilipinas - universe: maria lourdes gonzalez\n- binibining pilipinas - international: maria patricia betita\n- miss maja pilipinas: jennette fernando\n- binibining pilipinas - tourism: not awarded\n- first runner-up: anna marie torres\n- second runner-up: selina manalad\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. In the same year 1991, there are two rows? That might be a mistake in the table. Maybe each row is for a different event or perhaps a duplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each row represents a single year, so if both anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez are winners in the same year, then check their respective runner-ups.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I don't see any year where both anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez are listed as winners. In 1991, one row has anjanette as universe winner and another row (maybe a typo) lists maria lourdes as the universe winner. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for any year where both of them are first runners-up or something else, but the claim specifically mentions when they win, so they must be the winners.\n\nWait, in 1991, one row has anjanette abayari as the binibining pilipinas - universe winner, and another entry in the same year lists maria lourdes gonzalez as the universe winner. That can't both be true unless it's a mistake. So perhaps only one of them is the actual winner.\n\nSo maybe in 1991, the first row (row index 19) has anjanette abayari as the universe winner and jennette fernando as first runner-up, with anna marie torres as second runner-up, not selina manalad. Then the same year, another entry (maybe a duplication) shows maria lourdes gonzalez as the universe winner, but then the other details are different: miss maja is jennette fernando and second runner-up is selina manalad.\n\nThis suggests that in 1991, both anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez might have been considered for some titles, possibly leading to confusion. But likely, only one of them is the actual winner.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just check if in any given year, both anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez are winners (binibining pilipinas - universe) and that in the same year, selina manalad and jennette fernando are the second runner-ups.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1973: Winners are maria margarita moran and maria elena ojeda.\n- ...\n- 1991: First entry has anjanette abayari as universe winner, miss maja is selina manalad, first runner-up jennette fernando, second runner-up anna marie torres. Second entry in same year: universe winner maria lourdes gonzalez, miss maja jennette fernando, first runner-up anna marie torres, second runner-up selina manalad.\n\nSo in the same year 1991, there are two different sets of winners and runners-up listed. This might be an error, but for the purpose of this claim, perhaps only one row is correct.\n\nIf I take the first row (row index 19) as accurate: universe winner is anjanette abayari, miss maja is selina manalad, first runner-up jennette fernando, second runner-up anna marie torres. So in this case, when anjanette wins, the second runner-ups are not selina and jennette.\n\nBut the claim says that when anjanette and maria lourdes win, then selina and jennette are second runners-up. But from the table, it seems that in 1991, both can't be winners because they're listed separately. So maybe there's no year where both are winners.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the claim is about when anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez win together, which might not happen based on the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the duplication in 1991 is a mistake, so it's only one of them who wins. So if anjanette abayari is the universe winner, then her runners-up are jennette and anna marie. If maria lourdes is the universe winner, then her runners-up are jennette and selina.\n\nBut the claim says when both win together, which may not be accurate because they can't both win in the same year.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a different event where they're co-winners, but based on the table provided, it seems unlikely.\n\nSo perhaps there's no such year where both are winners, so the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, if the duplication in 1991 is intentional, meaning that in some cases, multiple winners or holders exist, then maybe we can consider that when anjanette and maria lourdes hold the title (even together), then the runners-up are selina and jennette. But I'm not sure.\n\nI think the key point is that the table shows two separate entries for 1991 with different winners and different runners-ups, which indicates confusion or errors. Therefore, it's unclear if there's a year where both anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez are winners, and in such a case, whether selina manalad and jennette fernando are the second runners-up.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is that no such year exists with both as winners, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez win together, Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando become the second runners-up\" does not hold based on the provided data. The table shows two separate entries for 1991, each with different winners and runners-up, indicating confusion or an error in documentation. There is no year where both Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez are listed as winners simultaneously, making the claim unsupported by the evidence.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false. There is no year indicated in the table where both Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez win together, with Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando as second runners-up.",
