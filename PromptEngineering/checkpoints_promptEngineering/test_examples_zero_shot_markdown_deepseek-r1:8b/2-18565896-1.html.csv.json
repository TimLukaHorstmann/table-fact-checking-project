    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Finland, Israel, and Ukraine do not win any gold medal or silver medal, but they win 1 bronze each.\" \n\nFirst, I should check what each of these nations has won according to the table. Let me look at the 'gold', 'silver', and 'bronze' columns for Finland, Israel, and Ukraine.\n\nStarting with Finland: Looking through the table, I see that Finland is ranked at position 20. In their row, under gold, silver, bronze, it shows 0, 0, and 1 respectively. So Finland has won one bronze medal. They don't have any gold or silver medals.\n\nNext, Israel: I'm searching for Israel in the nation column. Scanning through, I find that Israel is also ranked at position 20. Their row has gold as 0, silver as 0, and bronze as 1. So they also won one bronze medal without any gold or silver.\n\nNow, Ukraine: Again, checking the table, Ukraine is also at position 20 with the same rank as Finland and Israel. Their row shows 0 for gold, 0 for silver, and 1 for bronze. So Ukraine has one bronze medal as well.\n\nSo each of these three nations\u2014Finland, Israel, and Ukraine\u2014has won exactly one bronze medal each, and no medals in gold or silver. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The claim is about bronze medals specifically, so I'm focusing on the 'bronze' column for these three nations. There's nothing else mentioned in the claim that would require checking additional columns like total or rank.\n\nTherefore, since all three nations have 1 bronze medal each and no gold or silver, the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Germany and Great Britain's medals is true based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Germany win 5 more gold medals and 3 more silver medals than Great Britain.\" So I need to check how many golds and silvers each of them have according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that Germany is ranked 4th. Under their row, the gold column has a value of 5, and silver has 3. Now, for Great Britain, I have to find their row. Scanning through the list, I see Great Britain listed as rank 9 with 1 gold, 0 silvers, and 1 bronze. Their total is 2.\n\nWait, so Germany's gold is 5 and Great Britain's is 1. The difference in golds would be 5 - 1 = 4, not 5 as the claim says. That's a problem already. But maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check.\n\nGermany: rank 4, gold=5, silver=3.\nGreat Britain: rank 9, gold=1, silver=0.\n\nSo for golds, it's 5 vs 1. The difference is indeed 4, not 5. So the claim is incorrect on that front.\n\nBut let me check if I'm looking at the correct rows. Sometimes there might be multiple entries with the same rank, but in this table, each nation has a unique rank except for some where it's repeated, like rank 9 and 18. But Great Britain is alone at rank 9 with gold=1. So that part seems right.\n\nAlso, for silver medals: Germany has 3, Great Britain has 0. So the difference here is 3 - 0 = 3, which matches the claim. But since the gold difference is off, the overall claim is false.\n\nWait, maybe I should check bronze as well? The claim doesn't mention bronze, but just to make sure, Germany has 4 bronzes and Great Britain has 1. But again, that's not part of the claim, so it's irrelevant.\n\nSo putting it all together: For golds, the difference is 4, not 5. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Germany wins 5 more gold medals and 3 more silver than Great Britain. However, based on the table:\n\n- **Gold Medals**: Germany has 5, Great Britain has 1. The difference is 4, not 5.\n- **Silver Medals**: Germany has 3, Great Britain has 0. The difference here is correct at 3.\n\nSince one part of the claim doesn't hold, the overall statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the netherlands win the most gold medal of any country with 10, and russia come in second with 8 gold medal win.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. Each row lists a country along with their medals count.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. The Netherlands have the most gold medals, specifically 10.\n2. Russia come in second with 8 gold medals.\n\nSo, I need to check these points against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: do the Netherlands have the highest number of gold medals? Looking at the 'gold' column, I see the numbers for each nation. The Netherlands have 10 golds. Let me check other countries to see if any have more than 10.\n\nLooking down the list:\n- Russia has 8\n- France has 6\n- Germany has 5\n- Hungary has 3\n- Croatia has 2\n- Denmark has 2\n- Italy has 1\n- Austria has 1\n- Great Britain has 1\n- Norway has 1\n- Sweden has 0\n- Spain has 0\n- Poland has 0\n- Serbia has 0\n- Belarus has 0\n- Slovenia has 0\n- Estonia has 0\n- Lithuania has 0\n- Finland has 0\n- Israel has 0\n- Ukraine has 0\n\nNo country, as far as I can see, has more than 10 gold medals. So the Netherlands are indeed first with 10.\n\nNext part: Russia comes in second with 8 gold medals. Looking at the 'gold' column again, after Netherlands (10), the next highest is Russia with 8. Let me confirm that no other country has between 8 and 10. Since no one else does, Russia is indeed second in golds.\n\nNow, checking if any countries have 8 or more but less than 10. Russia has exactly 8, which makes them second place. No one else has 8 or above except Netherlands. So the claim holds.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the provided table. The Netherlands have the highest number of gold medals with 10, and Russia comes in second with 8. No other countries have more than 8 gold medals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table lists various nations along with their medal counts at the Olympic Games: gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. The claim in question is: \"Russia win 7 more medal total than the Netherlands, but the Netherlands win more gold.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down this claim into two parts to verify separately. The first part says Russia has 7 more total medals than the Netherlands. The second part claims that even though Russia has more total medals, the Netherlands have more gold medals.\n\nLooking at the table, I should identify the relevant cells for each part of the claim. For the total medals comparison between Russia and the Netherlands, I'll need their total medal counts. For the number of gold medals, I'll look specifically at the 'gold' column for both nations.\n\nStarting with Russia: I scan down the 'nation' column until I find \"russia\". It's in row 2. Their total medals are listed under the 'total' column as 21. \n\nNext, checking the Netherlands: I go back to the top and find \"netherlands\" in row 1. Their total medals are 14.\n\nNow, calculating the difference between Russia's and the Netherlands' totals: 21 - 14 equals 7. So yes, Russia does have 7 more total medals than the Netherlands. That part of the claim holds true.\n\nMoving on to the second part: do the Netherlands win more gold medals than Russia? I look at the 'gold' column for both countries. For Russia, their gold count is 8, and for the Netherlands, it's 10. So yes, the Netherlands have more gold medals than Russia.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim states that despite Russia having more total medals, the Netherlands have more gold. Both parts of this are correct based on the table data provided.\n\nI should also double-check if there's any other relevant information needed, but I think I've covered both comparisons. The key cells to verify are Russia's total and the Netherlands' total, as well as their respective gold medal counts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of it against the table.\n\n1. **Russia has 7 more total medals than the Netherlands:**\n   - Russia's total medals = 21\n   - Netherlands' total medals = 14\n   - Difference = 21 - 14 = 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. **Netherlands have more gold medals than Russia:**\n   - Netherlands' gold medals = 10\n   - Russia's gold medals = 8\n   - Since 10 > 8, this is true \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down what the claim says and then check it against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"sweden and spain didn't win any gold medal , but they have a total of 5 silver and bronze medal , each.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse this into two parts:\n\n1. Sweden and Spain did not win any gold medals.\n2. Both Sweden and Spain together have a total of 5 silver and bronze medals each.\n\nWait, actually, the wording is a bit unclear. The claim says they didn't win any gold medals but have a total of 5 silver and bronze medals each. Hmm, does that mean each country (Sweden and Spain) has a combined total of 5 silver and bronze? Or together, both have 5 each?\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nI need to find Sweden's and Spain's performance in terms of gold, silver, and bronze.\n\nStarting with Sweden:\n\nLooking through the table for \"sweden\". I see it's ranked 12th. Let me check their medals.\n\nFor Sweden:\n- Gold: 0\n- Silver: 3\n- Bronze: 2\nTotal medals: 5 (0+3+2).\n\nSo, Sweden has 0 gold, 3 silver, and 2 bronze medals. Therefore, they didn't win any gold medals, which aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nNow Spain:\n\nLooking for \"spain\" in the table, it's ranked 13th.\n\nFor Spain:\n- Gold: 0\n- Silver: 2\n- Bronze: 3\nTotal medals: 5 (0+2+3).\n\nSpain also has 0 gold medals, which matches the first part. Their silver is 2 and bronze is 3, so together their total silver and bronze are 5.\n\nNow, the claim says \"they have a total of 5 silver and bronze medal , each.\" So, does this mean that each country (Sweden and Spain) has 5? Or that together they have 5?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Sweden's total is 5.\n- Spain's total is also 5.\n\nSo both countries individually have 5 silver and bronze medals. Wait, no: Sweden has 3+2=5, Spain has 2+3=5. So each country has a combined total of 5 silver and bronze medals. Therefore, the claim is stating that each didn't win any gold but have 5 each in silver and bronze.\n\nSo the first part is correct for both: no golds. The second part also holds true for both Sweden and Spain\u2014each has 5 total (silver + bronze) medals.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not misinterpreting. The claim says \"they have a total of 5 silver and bronze medal , each.\" So perhaps it's saying that together, both Sweden and Spain have 5 each. But no, because individually they each have 5. So the wording might be a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, if it meant that together, Sweden and Spain have 5 each, but that wouldn't make sense because each country already has their own totals. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that each of them (Sweden and Spain) has 5 silver and bronze medals in total.\n\nSo yes, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}]}",

The claim says that Finland, Israel, and Lithuania do not win any gold or silver medals but each wins 1 bronze medal. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each of these nations in the table and check their performance. Starting with Finland. Looking through the table, I see Finland is ranked at position 20, along with Israel and Lithuania. The gold column for Finland shows 0, which means they didn't win any gold medals. The silver column also has 0, so no silver medals either. But bronze? Yes, Finland has 1 bronze medal.\n\nNext, Israel. Again, looking at the table, Israel is ranked 20th, same as Finland and Lithuania. Gold for Israel is 0, silver is 0, but bronze is 1. So that matches the claim: no gold or silver, one bronze each.\n\nNow, Lithuania. In the table, Lithuania is also at rank 18, along with Estonia. Checking their medals: gold is 0, silver is 1, and bronze is 0. Wait a minute, that's not what the claim says. The claim states they don't win any gold or silver, but according to the table, Lithuania has one silver medal. So this contradicts the claim.\n\nHmm, so if the claim says they don't win any gold or silver, but Lithuania actually won a silver, then the claim is false. However, I need to make sure I'm looking at the correct rows and columns.\n\nWait, let me double-check the table for Lithuania. The rank is 18, and in the bronze column, it's 0? Or did I misread? Looking again: yes, the bronze column for Lithuania shows 0. But silver is 1. So they have a silver medal. That means the claim about them not winning any gold or silver is incorrect because they have one silver.\n\nSo Finland and Israel fit the claim, but Lithuania does not.

Looking at the nations column:\n\n- Germany is ranked 4th.\n- Sweden is ranked 12th.\n\nNext, I need to check how many gold and silver medals each has. For Germany, looking at row 4 (since it's 0-indexed or not? Wait, the table shows rank starting from 1. So for example, rank 1 is Netherlands, which is row index 0 in the data. Therefore, Germany is in row 3 (index 3) because ranks start at 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The first row after the header is rank 1, so row index 0 corresponds to rank 1, and so on. So:\n\n- Netherlands: row 0\n- Russia: row 1\n- France: row 2\n- Germany: row 3\n...\n- Sweden: row 11 (since it's rank 12)\n\nSo for Germany:\n- Gold medals: Looking at row 3, the gold column has 5.\n- Silver medals: Row 3, silver is 3.\n\nFor Sweden:\n- Gold medals: Row 11, gold is 0.\n- Silver medals: Row 11, silver is 3.\n\nWait, that's interesting.

Let's break it down:\n\nGold: 5 (Germany) vs. 0 (Sweden). The difference is 5, which matches.\nSilver: 3 (Germany) vs. 3 (Sweden). The difference here is 0, not 3.\n\nSo the claim states that Germany has 3 more silver medals than Sweden. But in reality, they have the same number of silver medals. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's false on the silver part.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the table to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me look again at the total medals or perhaps other rows for verification.\n\nLooking at row 11 (Sweden), gold is indeed 0 and silver is 3. For Germany, row 4: gold 5, silver 3. So yes, the difference in gold is correct, but silver is same, not more by 3.\n\nSo the claim is false because it incorrectly states that Germany has more silver medals than Sweden when they actually have the same number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Germany wins 5 more gold and 3 more silver than Sweden.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about Russia and France is true based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Russia win the most gold medals of any country with 8, and France come in second with 6 gold medal wins.\" So I need to verify two things here: whether Russia has the highest number of gold medals and whether France is next with the second-highest. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a nation, and there's a 'gold' column that shows how many gold medals each country won. My first task is to identify Russia's position in terms of gold medals.\n\nFrom the table, I see Russia is ranked 2nd. Their gold count is 8. Let me check if any other countries have more than 8. Scanning down, the Netherlands has 10, which is higher than Russia's 8. So that would mean the claim is incorrect because Russia isn't the highest; the Netherlands has more.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me double-check. Yes, the first row for the Netherlands shows gold as 10, which is indeed more than Russia's 8. So the claim's first part is false because Russia doesn't have the most gold medals. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let's look at all countries' gold counts. The highest is the Netherlands with 10, then Russia with 8, followed by France with 6, and so on. So the ranking for gold medals would be: Netherlands (10), Russia (8), France (6), Germany (5), Hungary (3), Croatia (2), Denmark (2), Italy (1), Austria (1), Great Britain (1), Sweden (0), Spain (0), Poland (0), Serbia (0), Belarus (0), Slovenia (0), Estonia (0), Lithuania (0), Finland (0), Israel (0), Ukraine (0).\n\nSo the order is clear: Netherlands first, Russia second, France third. Therefore, Russia has 8 golds, which is more than France's 6 but less than the Netherlands. The claim says Russia wins the most, so that part is false because the Netherlands has more.\n\nWait, hold on. Did I get the ranking right? Let me make sure. The 'rank' column is separate from the medal counts. So rank 1 is Netherlands with 10 golds, rank 2 is Russia with 8, etc. So yes, Russia isn't first in total medals either, but the claim only mentions gold medals.\n\nSo the key point is that the claim says Russia has the most gold medals. But according to the table, the Netherlands have more (10), so Russia doesn't hold the top spot in gold. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on this front.\n\nAdditionally, France is next with 6, which is correct. So while the second part of the claim is true, the first part is false because another country has more golds.\n\nBut wait, does the claim say \"the most gold medals\" without specifying they have the highest number. Since Russia is second in gold but first in total medals? No, actually, the 'total' column shows that Russia's total medals are 21, which is higher than Netherlands' 14. But the claim only refers to gold medals.\n\nSo focusing solely on gold: Russia has 8, France has 6, and the Netherlands have 10. Therefore, Russia doesn't have the most; they're second in gold counts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim's first part is false, making the entire statement incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Russia wins the most gold medals with 8 and France comes in second with 6. However, the Netherlands has 10 gold medals, more than Russia. Thus, Russia doesn't have the highest gold count.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the medal table is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"netherlands win 7 more medal total than the netherlands , but the russia win more gold.\"\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It says the Netherlands have 7 more medals in total compared to... themselves? That doesn't make sense because comparing a nation to itself would mean zero difference. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding here.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a nation with their gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. For the Netherlands (rank 1), they have 10 gold, 3 silver, 1 bronze, totaling 14 medals.\n\nNow, the claim mentions Russia winning more gold. Let's check Russia's performance. Russia is ranked 2nd with 8 gold, 5 silver, and 8 bronze, totaling 21 medals. So, in terms of gold, Russia has 8, which is indeed more than the Netherlands' 10? Wait no, wait: Russia has 8 gold, the Netherlands have 10, so actually, the Netherlands have more gold than Russia.\n\nWait, that contradicts the claim. The claim says the Netherlands win more medals but also that Russia wins more gold. But according to this table, the Netherlands have 14 total medals and 10 gold, while Russia has 21 total medals and 8 gold. So in terms of total medals, the Netherlands don't have 7 more than themselves; that comparison doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"netherlands win 7 more medal total than the netherlands.\" That still sounds odd because you can't compare a country to itself for the number of medals they've won. Perhaps it's meant to say another country? Or maybe there's a typo in the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is stating that the Netherlands have 7 more total medals than some other country, but it just says \"netherlands\" again, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo perhaps the first part of the claim is incorrect. The second part mentions Russia winning more gold, which seems correct because Russia has 8 gold while the Netherlands have 10? Wait no, wait: No, the Netherlands have 10 gold, and Russia have 8. So Russia actually has fewer gold medals than the Netherlands.\n\nWait, let me check again. Netherlands: 10 gold, Russia: 8. So the Netherlands have more gold. Therefore, the claim's second part is incorrect because Russia doesn't have more gold than the Netherlands.\n\nSo both parts of the claim seem to be false. The first part about having 7 more medals than themselves is nonsensical, and the second part about Russia winning more gold is also wrong because the Netherlands have more gold.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's first assertion about the Netherlands is incorrect due to a self-comparison, and the second part regarding Russia's gold count is also false as Russia has fewer gold medals than the Netherlands. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about Poland and Spain is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"Poland and Spain didn't win any gold medal, but they have a total of 2 silver and bronze medals each.\" So I need to check two main points here:\n\n1. Did Poland and Spain win any gold medals?\n2. Do both Poland and Spain have exactly 2 silver and bronze medals combined?\n\nStarting with the first part: checking for gold medals won by Poland and Spain.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for \"Poland\" and \"Spain.\" For Poland, their row is ranked 14. In that row, under 'gold', it shows 0. So Poland didn't win any gold medals. That checks out.\n\nNow, checking Spain. Spain's row is ranked 13. The 'gold' column here also shows 0. So Spain didn't win any gold medals either. Good so far.\n\nNext, the second part of the claim: each (presumably both) Poland and Spain have a total of 2 silver and bronze medals. Let me calculate that for each country.\n\nStarting with Poland. Their 'silver' column is 2 and 'bronze' is 0. So total medals from silver and bronze would be 2 + 0 = 2. That matches the claim.\n\nNow Spain. Spain's 'silver' is 2 and 'bronze' is 3. Adding those gives 2 + 3 = 5. Wait, that doesn't match the claim which says \"a total of 2 silver and bronze medals each.\" So Spain has 5 in total, not 2.\n\nHmm, this seems contradictory. The claim states both Poland and Spain have 2 each, but according to the table, Poland does (2), while Spain does not (5). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's only true for Poland, not Spain.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the table for Spain. Yes, in the 'silver' column under Spain, it says 2 and bronze is 3. So total silver + bronze is 5, not 2. Therefore, the claim is false because only Poland meets the condition, not Spain.\n\nSo, putting this together: both didn't win any golds (correct), but only Poland has the 2 silver/bronze, while Spain doesn't. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Poland and Spain did not win any gold medals but each have a total of 2 silver and bronze medals. Checking the table:\n\n- Poland: 0 gold, 2 silver, 0 bronze \u2192 Total 2 (silver + bronze).\n- Spain: 0 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze \u2192 Total 5 (silver + bronze).\n\nThus, only Poland meets the condition, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
