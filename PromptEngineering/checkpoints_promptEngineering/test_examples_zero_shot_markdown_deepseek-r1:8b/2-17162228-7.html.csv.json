    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the first place tie between duffy waldorf, jeff sluman and frank nobilo.\" Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. The table has several columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. My main focus is on determining if Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo tied for first place.\n\nLooking at the 'place' column, the top position listed is \"t1\" which I assume stands for tied 1st place. So that's the highest spot in this tournament.\n\nNow, checking each player mentioned in the claim: Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo.\n\nStarting with Duffy Waldorf: I need to find his row in the table. Scanning through, under 'player', the name \"duffy waldorf\" is found in row 9, which is t9. His score is 74 + 68 + 73 + 69 = 284, and his to par is listed as e, which probably means even or tied at -1.\n\nNext, Jeff Sluman: His name appears in the same row as Frank Nobilo and others, all under t9 place. So Jeff Sluman's score is also 72 + 69 + 72 + 71 = 284, same to par of e, and he gets 37179 money.\n\nThen, Frank Nobilo: He's also in row 9 with the same score and to par as Jeff Sluman. So all three\u2014Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo\u2014are tied at t9 place, which is actually tied for 9th position. Wait a minute, that can't be first place.\n\nLooking back at the table, the highest place mentioned before t9 is t1, then t6, etc. So t9 is much lower down. The top tier is t1, then t4, t5, t6, and so on. So if all three are tied for t9, they're nowhere near first place.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there's a tie for first place among these three players seems to be false because their placement was at t9, not t1. I need to check each of their rows to confirm this.\n\nSo Duffy Waldorf is in row 9, Jeff Sluman also in row 9, and Frank Nobilo similarly in row 9. Their places are all t9, which is far from first place. The players actually in first place are in the t1 rows: ernie els, colin montgomerie, and loren roberts.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no tie for first place between these three; they tied for 9th instead.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo tied for first place. However, upon reviewing the table, all three are listed in row 9 with a place of t9, which is not first place but rather tied for ninth. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
