    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being claimed here. It mentions Galina Voskoboeva playing a total of three games, and each game was on a hard tennis court. So I need to check the table for any matches involving her.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five entries: two winners, and three runner-ups. The columns include outcome (winner or runner-up), date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nI should go through each row and see if Galina Voskoboeva is mentioned as an opponent in any of these matches.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. First row: Runner-up on 28 January 2003 at Tipton on hard court vs Matea Mezak. Opponent here is Matea Mezak, not Galina.\n2. Second row: Winner on 29 June 2003 at Mont-de-Marsan on hard vs Oleksandra Kravets. Opponent is Oleksandra Kravets, not Galina.\n3. Third row: Runner-up on 3 October 2003 in Latina on clay vs Roberta Vinci. Opponent is Roberta Vinci; no match with Galina here.\n4. Fourth row: Runner-up on 8 November 2005 at Pittsburgh on hard vs Lilia Osterloh. Again, opponent is Lilia Osterloh, not Galina.\n5. Fifth row: Winner on 6 June 2006 in Cuneo, Italy on clay vs Alice Canepa. Opponent here is Alice Canepa.\n\nSo, none of the opponents are Galina Voskoboeva. That suggests she didn't participate in any matches listed in this table. Therefore, the claim that she played three games on hard courts isn't supported by this data.\n\nWait, but I should make sure if Galina is present elsewhere or maybe in a different role, like as a participant in another tournament not listed here. However, since the table only shows specific tournaments, and she's not an opponent in any of them, it's safe to assume she didn't play three games on hard courts in these matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because there's no evidence in the provided table that Galina Voskoboeva played three games on a hard court. The relevant cells are all the ones with the 'opponent' column since they're the only ones where she would appear as an opponent. But since none of them have her name, those are the relevant cells to check.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"galina voskoboeva play 20% of her game on a clay top tennis court.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Galina Voskoboeva is mentioned in the table. Looking through the 'opponent' column, I see names like Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, Lilia Osterloh, and Alice Canepa. Galina's name doesn't appear here, so maybe she wasn't involved in any of these tournaments listed.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the claim isn't about her being an opponent but rather about her playing on clay courts. So I need to look at the 'surface' column. The table has entries like 'hard (i)' and 'clay'. \n\nNow, how much of her games are played on clay? The claim says 20%. There's no direct information in the table about the percentage of games she plays on any surface. It only shows specific matches where she was either a runner-up or a winner. So each row represents one tournament, not an aggregate of all her games.\n\nTherefore, since the table doesn't provide data on the percentage of clay court games she's played, we can't verify if 20% is accurate. The claim might be making a general statement about her game play, but without specific data points from the table, it's impossible to confirm or deny based on the given information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Galina Voskoboeva playing 20% of her games on clay courts, but the table doesn't mention her participation in any tournaments. Without data on her game frequency on clay, the claim can't be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"galina voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what information is needed to evaluate the claim. The claim is about Galina Voskoboeva's win rates on clay and hard courts. So I need to look for her performance in each of these surfaces.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various tournaments, dates, surfaces (hard or clay), opponents, and scores. Each row represents either a win or a loss. The 'surface' column indicates whether the tournament was played on hard or clay.\n\nNow, I need to check if Galina Voskoboeva has an equal number of wins on both clay and hard courts. To do this, I should look for all her matches where she won (since that's a win) and categorize them by surface.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. Runner-up on 28 January 2003 in Tipton on hard court against Matea Mezak. Since it's a runner-up, this is a loss.\n2. Winner on 29 June 2003 in Mont-de-Marsan on hard against Oleksandra Kravets. This is a win on hard.\n3. Runner-up on 3 October 2003 in Latina on clay against Roberta Vinci. Loss on clay.\n4. Runner-up on 8 November 2005 in Pittsburgh on hard against Lilia Osterloh. Loss on hard.\n5. Winner on 6 June 2006 in Cuneo, Italy on clay against Alice Canepa. Win on clay.\n\nFrom this table, I see that Galina Voskoboeva has two wins: one on hard (against Kravets) and one on clay (against Canepa). She lost three times: twice on hard (Mezak and Osterloh) and once on clay (Vinci).\n\nSo her win rate on hard is 1 out of 2, since she won once and lost once. On clay, she also has 1 win out of 2 wins and losses. Wait, no\u2014wait, in the table, each row represents a single match, so for each surface, I should count how many times she won.\n\nWait, actually, looking at it again, the 'surface' column shows either hard or clay. So for each of her matches where she was a winner, we can categorize them by surface.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Winner on hard: 1 match (Kravets)\n- Winner on clay: 1 match (Canepa)\n\nSo in terms of number of wins, she has one win on hard and one win on clay. But wait, no\u2014wait, each row is a separate match. So for her total wins, it's two in total: one on hard, one on clay.\n\nBut the claim is about her having an equal winrate between both surfaces. Win rate would be the number of wins divided by total matches played. Wait, but in this table, it seems each row is a single match, so for each surface, how many times did she win?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The 'outcome' column says either winner or runner-up, which means that each row is one match where she either won or lost.\n\nSo, if we look at her wins on hard and clay:\n\n- On hard: She has 1 win (against Kravets) and 2 losses (Mezak and Osterloh). So total matches on hard: 3. Wins: 1.\n- On clay: She has 1 win (against Canepa) and 1 loss (Vinci). Total matches on clay: 2. Wins: 1.\n\nWait, no, because the table shows all her matches where she was either winner or runner-up. So for each surface, we need to count how many times she won there.\n\nSo:\n\nHard court wins: She won once (against Kravets).\nClay court wins: She won once (against Canepa).\n\nSo total wins on hard: 1.\nTotal wins on clay: 1.\n\nTherefore, her win rate is equal on both surfaces\u2014she has one win each. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe I'm missing some matches that aren't in this table. The table provided only shows five matches of Galina Voskoboeva. It's possible she had more wins elsewhere not listed here, but based on the data given, within the table, her win rates are equal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be where she won on hard and clay.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table provided. Galina Voskoboeva has one win on both hard and clay courts based on the data shown.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"galina voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the table represents. It seems like it's a tournament record with details such as outcome (winner or runner-up), date, tournament name, surface type, opponent, and the score. So each row in this table is an instance of a match Galina Voskoboeva played.\n\nNow, the claim is about her never playing the same opponent more than once. To check this, I need to see if there are any instances where she faced the same opponent twice or more. If such cases exist, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n1. The first row (row index 0): outcome is runner-up, date January 28, 2003, tournament Tipton, surface hard(i), opponent Matea Mezak. So Galina played Matea here.\n2. Second row: winner on June 29, 2003, Mont-de-Marsan, hard(i), opponent Oleksandra Kravets.\n3. Third row: runner-up on October 3, 2003, Latina, clay, Roberta Vinci.\n4. Fourth row: runner-up on November 8, 2005, Pittsburgh, hard, Lilia Osterloh.\n5. Fifth row: winner on June 6, 2006, Cuneo, Italy, clay, Alice Canepa.\n\nI need to check each opponent and see if any appear more than once across different matches. So I'll list the opponents:\n\n- Matea Mezak\n- Oleksandra Kravets\n- Roberta Vinci\n- Lilia Osterloh\n- Alice Canepa\n\nLooking at these names, they all seem distinct; none of them repeat in the table. Each opponent is listed only once.\n\nTherefore, Galina Voskoboeva didn't play any opponent more than once based on this table data.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure there are no duplicates beyond what's shown here. Since each row has a unique opponent, and the table doesn't have multiple entries for the same tournament or date, it seems safe to conclude she never faced the same opponent twice.\n\nSo the claim is true because there's no instance where Galina played the same opponent more than once in her matches listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva never played the same opponent more than once.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"on average, galina voskoboeva lose with only 4 point.\" So, the claim is about Galina Voskoboeva's average performance in tournaments, specifically that she loses with an average score of 4 points. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various tournaments, dates, surfaces, opponents, and scores for both winners and runners-up. The key here is to find if any of Galina Voskoboeva's matches fit this claim.\n\nWait, but wait a second\u2014Galina Voskoboeva isn't listed in the table at all. Let me check each row carefully:\n\n- In the first row, the runner-up is Matea Mezak.\n- Second row, winner is Oleksandra Kravets.\n- Third, runner-up is Roberta Vinci.\n- Fourth, runner-up is Lilia Osterloh.\n- Fifth, winner is Alice Canepa.\n\nNone of these names are Galina Voskoboeva. So, does that mean the claim is false? Because there's no data about her in the table, so we can't verify whether she loses with 4 points on average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"Galina Voskoboeva\" is a player who might have participated but isn't listed here. But given that all entries are specific players, and none match Galina's name, the table doesn't provide any information about her.\n\nSo, without any data on Galina Voskoboeva in the table, we can't support the claim.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Galina Voskoboeva has an equal winrate between both clay and hard court but she never wins.\" So, I need to check two main points here:\n1. Does Galina Voskoboeva have an equal win rate on clay and hard courts?\n2. Did she ever win any tournaments in either of those surfaces?\n\nLooking at the table provided, I can see that it lists various outcomes of tournaments, including who won or was the runner-up, along with details like date, tournament name, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nWait, the table seems to list winners and runner-ups for different tournaments. But I don't see any information about Galina Voskoboeva in there. Let me check each row:\n\n- Runner-up: Matea Mezak on hard court.\n- Winner: Oleksandra Kravets on hard court.\n- Runner-up: Roberta Vinci on clay.\n- Runner-up: Lilia Osterloh on hard court.\n- Winner: Alice Canepa on clay.\n\nHmm, Galina's name isn't listed. That might be a problem because if she didn't participate in any of these tournaments, then we can't directly compare her win rates or wins from the table. So, does that mean the claim is false?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. The table could have more entries beyond what's shown here. However, based on the information given, there's no data about Galina Voskoboeva. Therefore, we can't confirm whether she has equal win rates or any wins.\n\nSo, considering that, the claim is making a statement about her without evidence from the table, which suggests the claim isn't supported by the provided data. Hence, it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, I checked each row for Galina Voskoboeva's participation but found none.

Let me start by understanding the claim: \"Galina Voskoboeva play a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court, and 1 on clay.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if Galina was involved in those matches. The table lists outcomes for different tournaments, dates, surfaces, opponents, and scores.\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column: I need to check if any of these opponents are Galina Voskoboeva. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent is Matea Mezak. Not Galina.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is Oleksandra Kravets. Also not Galina.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is Roberta Vinci. Nope.\n4. **Row 3**: Opponent is Lilia Osterloh. Still not.\n5. **Row 4**: Opponent is Alice Canepa. Not Galina either.\n\nHmm, none of these opponents are Galina Voskoboeva. That suggests she wasn't involved in these matches. But maybe I should double-check if there's another way to connect her. Wait, the claim says \"Galina Voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court, and 1 on clay.\" So it's about her participation, not just being an opponent.\n\nLooking at the 'tournament' column: Are any of these tournaments known for Galina? I don't have that context. The claim is about her playing, so perhaps she was either the winner or runner-up in those matches.\n\nLet me see if Galina won any matches here. Checking each outcome:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Runner-up.\n2. **Row 1**: Winner.\n3. **Row 2**: Runner-up.\n4. **Row 3**: Runner-up.\n5. **Row 4**: Winner.\n\nSo in rows 1 and 4, she was the winner. But that's only two wins. The claim says she played three hard court games and one on clay. So unless I'm missing something, there are only two matches where she won\u2014both on hard courts (rows 1 and 4). \n\nLooking at the surfaces: row 0 is hard(i), rows 1-3 have different surfaces, but in her wins, it's hard court. So maybe she has two hard court wins. But the claim says three on hard and one on clay.\n\nAlso, I should check if Galina was involved as an opponent or participant in any of these matches. Since none of the opponents match her name, perhaps she wasn't playing against them but was a participant elsewhere. However, without more data, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to multiple tournaments where she won three hard court games and one on clay. But from the table, she only has two wins, both on hard courts (June 2006 and June 2003). There's no match in the table with a clay surface where she was involved as winner or runner-up.\n\nWait, row 2 is a runner-up on clay but against Roberta Vinci. If Galina didn't play that match, then she might not have played on clay at all according to this table. So her total games on hard would be two, and none on clay, which contradicts the claim of three hard and one clay.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Galina Voskoboeva only played in two matches as a winner on hard courts (June 2003 and June 2006), with no matches on clay.

The claim says: \"galina voskoboeva play 20% of her game on a clay top tennis court and 1% on hard.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any information related to Galina Voskoboeva's games on clay or hard courts. Let me scan each row.\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column: it lists names like Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, etc. None of these names seem familiar as Galina Voskoboeva, so I might have to check if she's even in this table. Wait, perhaps the opponents are other players she played against. So maybe Galina is the winner or runner-up in some matches listed here.\n\nLooking at the 'tournament' column: the tournaments include Tipton, Mont-de-Marsan, Latina, Pittsburgh, and Cuneo, Italy. These don't immediately indicate the surface, but I can check the 'surface' column for each row to see which were clay or hard.\n\nNow, the 'surface' column has entries like 'hard (i)' and 'clay'. The claim refers to 20% on clay and 1% on hard. So I'm looking for rows where she either won or was a runner-up on clay or hard surfaces.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Runner-up, Tipton, hard (i), Matea Mezak.

But in this table, she has 2 clay wins/runner-ups and 3 hard wins/runner-ups out of 5 total matches listed here. \n\nWait, but I don't know if these are all her games or just a sample. The claim doesn't specify the time frame, so perhaps it's about all her games in the table. So total games: 5.\n\nIf she played 2 clay and 3 hard, that would be 40% clay (2/5) and 60% hard (3/5), which contradicts the claim of 20% and 1%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about her overall career. But without more data, I can't verify that. The table only shows 5 matches.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the claim is about how much of her games are played on clay versus hard in general. If the table includes 2 clay wins and 3 hard, then 40% clay, which doesn't match 20%. So maybe the claim is false because she has more clay than stated.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if all her matches are included here or just some. The instruction says to check each condition against the table, so perhaps it's only about what's in the table.\n\nIn that case, since in the table she has 2 clay and 3 hard matches, which is more than 20% on clay (she actually plays more), the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Galina Voskoboeva plays 20% of her games on clay and 1% on hard.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Galina Voskoboeva is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Galina Voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than 1 time except in 6 june 2006.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim is asserting. It seems to suggest that Galina only played each opponent once, except for one instance where she played someone twice\u2014specifically on June 6, 2006. So the exception is allowed only on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents either a 'winner' or 'runner-up' in a tournament, with details about the date, tournament name, surface type, opponent, and score. The goal is to check if any opponent appears more than once except for one case, which should be on June 6, 2006.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the opponents:\n\n1. Runner-up on January 28, 2003: Opponent is Matea Mezak.\n2. Winner on June 29, 2003: Opponent is Oleksandra Kravets.\n3. Runner-up on October 3, 2003: Opponent is Roberta Vinci.\n4. Runner-up on November 8, 2005: Opponent is Lilia Osterloh.\n5. Winner on June 6, 2006: Opponent is Alice Canepa.\n\nNow, I'll check for duplicates:\n\n- Matea Mezak appears only once (row 0).\n- Oleksandra Kravets appears once (row 1).\n- Roberta Vinci once (row 2).\n- Lilia Osterloh once (row 3).\n- Alice Canepa once in row 4.\n\nWait, but the claim says she never played the same opponent more than once except on June 6, 2006. However, looking at the table, each opponent is unique across all rows. That means there are no duplicates except possibly on June 6, which isn't even a duplicate here\u2014it's the only time Alice Canepa appears.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. The claim seems to suggest that she played someone twice once, but according to the table, every opponent is only listed once. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's not about playing the same opponent multiple times, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps in the original context beyond the table, there might be more matches where she faced the same opponent.\n\nBut based solely on this table, each opponent appears only once. Therefore, if the claim says she never played the same opponent more than once except for June 6, 2006, but the table shows no duplicates at all, then maybe the claim is false because there are no instances where she played the same opponent twice.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the table:\n\nLooking at each row's 'date' and 'opponent':\n\n- January 28, 2003: Matea Mezak.\n- June 29, 2003: Oleksandra Kravets.\n- October 3, 2003: Roberta Vinci.\n- November 8, 2005: Lilia Osterloh.\n- June 6, 2006: Alice Canepa.\n\nNo duplicates here. So according to the table, Galina hasn't played any opponent more than once. Therefore, the claim's statement that she never plays the same opponent more than once except on June 6 is incorrect because there are no such instances in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exception was intended for a particular case not covered here, but based on this data, it's false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Galina Voskoboeva is true or false, we need to check if any opponents appear more than once in the table provided. \n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Opponents:**\n   - Matea Mezak (January 28, 2003)\n   - Oleksandra Kravets (June 29, 2003)\n   - Roberta Vinci (October 3, 2003)\n   - Lilia Osterloh (November 8, 2005)\n   - Alice Canepa (June 6, 2006)\n\n2. **Check for Duplicates:**\n   - Each opponent appears only once in the table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim suggests that Galina played each opponent at most once except on June 6, 2006. However, based on the provided data, she hasn't played any opponent more than once. Therefore, the claim is false because there are no instances where she faced the same opponent multiple times as allowed by the exception.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "on average , galina voskoboeva lose with only 4 point against oleksandra kravets and alice canepa",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. So, the claim says: \"On average, Galina Voskoboeva loses with only 4 points against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. The table lists various tournaments, outcomes (whether she won or was a runner-up), dates, surfaces, opponents, and scores.\n\nI should focus on the relevant parts of the claim. It mentions Galina Voskoboeva losing with only 4 points against two specific opponents: Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa. So I need to check if there are matches in the table where she lost those two opponents with a score that includes 4 points.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In the first row, Galina isn't involved because the opponent is Matea Mezak.\n- The second row shows Oleksandra Kravets as the winner, so Galina must be the runner-up. The score is 6-4 and 6-2. Wait, that's for the winner. So the scores when she lost would be opposite. Hmm, maybe I need to reverse engineer it.\n\nWait, if Oleksandra Kravets won, then Galina was the runner-up. So the score would be the opposite of what's listed. But in the table, the winner's score is 6-4 and 6-2. That means Galina lost those sets? No, that doesn't make sense because if she was the runner-up, she might have lost all sets. Wait, but the score is for the winner. So maybe I should think about it as her losing each set.\n\nBut actually, in tennis, when a player loses, their score is lower than the winner's. So if the winner has 6-4 and 6-2, that means Galina lost those sets. But how does that relate to her total points? Wait, the claim says she loses with only 4 points against them. Maybe it's about the total points over the match.\n\nBut in the second row, the score is 6-4, 6-2. So for each set she lost, she got 4 and 2 points respectively. But that doesn't add up to 4 points overall. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps it's about the total points across all sets.\n\nWait, no, in a two-set match, if she lost both sets, her points would be 4 + 2 = 6, not 4. So that can't be right. Maybe there's another match where she lost with 4 points against one of them.\n\nLooking further down the table:\n\nThe fifth row shows Alice Canepa as the opponent in a match Galina won on June 6, 2006. The score is 6-1 and 6-2. So again, if Alice was the winner, that would be her score, so Galina lost both sets with 1 and 2 points each. But 1+2=3, not 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Perhaps the claim is referring to a situation where she lost a set with only 4 points. So in one set, she lost with 4 points against Kravets or Canepa.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- For Oleksandra Kravets, in row 1, she won with scores 6-4 and 6-2. Wait, no, that's the winner's score. If Galina was the runner-up, then she lost both sets, so her points would be 4 and 2, totaling 6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing rows. Let me check row indices properly.\n\nRow 0: Runner-up, Matea Mezak. No relevance to Oleksandra or Alice.\nRow 1: Winner, Kravets, score 6-4 and 6-2. So Galina lost both sets, her points would be 4 and 2, totaling 6.\nRow 2: Runner-up, Vinci, clay surface. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Runner-up, Osterloh. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Winner, Canepa. Galina lost with scores 1-6 and 2-6, so her points are 1 and 2, totaling 3.\n\nSo in neither case did she lose a set with only 4 points against either Kravets or Canepa. The claim says on average she loses with only 4 points against them, but from the table, she lost both sets against Kravets (totaling 6) and one set against Canepa (with 1 point). There's no instance where she lost a match with just 4 points against either of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"only 4 points.\" Maybe it refers to the total points in the match. So if she lost both sets, her total is higher than 4. Alternatively, maybe it's about sets lost with only 4 points, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the claim is referring to a specific type of loss where she didn't win any set, but the score sums up to 4 points. But in both cases against Kravets and Canepa, she lost multiple sets, so her total points would be more than 4.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table that Galina Voskoboeva loses with only 4 points against either of those opponents. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva averages losing with only 4 points against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa. Upon reviewing the table, there are no instances where she lost to these opponents with a total of 4 points across all sets. She lost both sets against Kravets (totaling 6 points) and one set against Canepa (1 point), but not in a way that averages to 4 points. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
