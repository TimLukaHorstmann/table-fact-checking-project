    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table lists various games with details like home team, score, away team, their scores, venue, crowd size, and the date of each game.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"at mcg , the away team , footscray , score 10.11 (71)\". I need to check if this statement correctly references any cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n- Venue: McG\n- Away team: Footscray\n- Their score: 10.11 (71)\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details. I need to find if there's a row where all these conditions match.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Hawthorn vs South Melbourne**: Venue is Glenferrie Oval. Away team is South Melbourne. Doesn't match.\n2. **Essendon vs Richmond**: Venue is Windy Hill. Away team is Richmond. No match.\n3. **Carlton vs Collingwood**: Venue is Princes Park. Away team is Collingwood. Not relevant.\n4. **St Kilda vs North Melbourne**: Venue is Junction Oval. Doesn't fit.\n5. **Melbourne vs Footscray**: Venue is McG. Yes, that's a match so far. The away team here is Footscray. Let me check their score: it's 10.11 (71). That matches exactly with the claim.\n\n6. **Geelong vs Fitzroy**: Venue is Corio Oval. Not relevant.\n\nSo in row index 5, all three parts of the claim are present: venue is McG, away team is Footscray, and their score is 10.11 (71).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are at row index 5 for venue, away team, and away team score columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various clubs and their games, including home teams, scores, away teams, venues, crowd sizes, and dates. The claim I need to verify is: \"the crowd size for the footscray v melbourne game be 20244.\"\n\nFirst, I should figure out which row in the table corresponds to the Footscray vs Melbourne game. Looking at the home teams and away teams:\n\n- In row 0, the home team is Hawthorn, so that's not it.\n- Row 1: Essendon as home, Richmond away\u2014nope.\n- Row 2: Carlton vs Collingwood. Not them.\n- Row 3: St Kilda vs North Melbourne. No.\n- Row 4: Melbourne (home) vs Footscray (away). Yes, that's the one we're looking for.\n\nNow, I need to find the crowd size for this game. In row 4, under the \"crowd\" column, the value is 20244.\n\nThe claim says the crowd size is exactly 20244. So that matches exactly with what's in the table.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be from row 4, specifically the \"crowd\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"On May 30, 1931, Hawthorn and Richmond play at Princess Park with attendance be 9000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n- Date: May 30, 1931\n- Teams: Hawthorn vs. Richmond\n- Venue: Princess Park\n- Attendance: 9000\n\nNow, looking at the table in markdown format, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, along with their scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nI need to go through each row to check for matches that fit all these criteria on May 30, 1931.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Home Team: Hawthorn\n- Away Team: South Melbourne\n- Venue: Glenferrie Oval\n- Crowd: 11000\n- Date: May 30, 1931\n\nThis doesn't match because Richmond isn't the away team here.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home Team: Essendon\n- Away Team: Richmond\n- Venue: Windy Hill\n- Crowd: 15000\n- Date: May 30, 1931\n\nHere, the teams are Essendon and Richmond, but the venue is Windy Hill, not Princess Park. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThird row:\n- Home Team: Carlton\n- Away Team: Collingwood\n- Venue: Princes Park\n- Crowd: 35000\n- Date: May 30, 1931\n\nThis matches the venue as Princess Park, but the teams are Carlton and Collingwood, not Hawthorn and Richmond. So it's close but not exactly.\n\nFourth row:\n- Home Team: St Kilda\n- Away Team: North Melbourne\n- Venue: Junction Oval\n- Crowd: 10000\n- Date: May 30, 1931\n\nNo match here either.\n\nFifth row:\n- Home Team: Melbourne\n- Away Team: Footscray\n- Venue: MCG\n- Crowd: 20244\n- Date: May 30, 1931\n\nThe venue is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), not Princess Park.\n\nSixth row:\n- Home Team: Geelong\n- Away Team: Fitzroy\n- Venue: Corio Oval\n- Crowd: 9000\n- Date: May 30, 1931\n\nThis doesn't fit as teams are Geelong and Fitzroy, venue is Corio Oval.\n\nSo, none of the rows match all the criteria mentioned in the claim. The claim says Hawthorn and Richmond play at Princess Park with attendance 9000, but looking through each row:\n\n- There's no match between Hawthorn and Richmond on May 30, 1931.\n- Princess Park is the venue for Carlton vs. Collingwood on that date, not Hawthorn vs. Richmond.\n- The crowd size doesn't match 9000 for any of these matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because the specific conditions aren't met in any row of the table provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"At McG, the home team score 10.11 (71).\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table to see if there's a match for this information. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim mentions \"McG\" as the venue, so I need to check the venue column in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Venue is glenferrie oval \u2013 not McG.\n2. Row 1: Venue is windy hill \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: Venue is princes park \u2013 no.\n4. Row 3: Venue is junction oval \u2013 not McG.\n5. Row 4: Venue is mcg \u2013 yes, this matches.\n6. Row 5: Venue is corio oval \u2013 no.\n\nSo, the only relevant row for the venue is row 4, which has home team melbourne and away team footscray. The claim mentions the home team's score, so I need to check the home team score column in that row.\n\nLooking at row 4 under \"home team score,\" it says 13.9 (87). Wait, but the claim states the home team scored 10.11 (71). That doesn't match because melbourne scored 13.9 (87), not 10.11 (71).\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect for two reasons: first, the venue matches McG in row 4, but the score doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that at McG, the home team's score was 10.11 (71). Checking the table, McG is indeed a venue in row 4, but the home team there, melbourne, scored 13.9 (87), not 10.11 (71). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the crowd size be 20244 for the game at fitzroy.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two things: the crowd size should be 20244 and the game was against Fitzroy. I'll need to check both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date. The relevant columns for the claim are 'crowd' and 'away team', since the game is likely listed as the away team Fitzroy. Wait, no\u2014the away team would be the opponent of the home team. So if the game was at Fitzroy, that implies Fitzroy is either the home or away team.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Hawthorn vs South Melbourne \u2013 venue is Glenferrie Oval\n2. Essendon vs Richmond \u2013 Windy Hill\n3. Carlton vs Collingwood \u2013 Princes Park\n4. St Kilda vs North Melbourne \u2013 Junction Oval\n5. Melbourne vs Footscray \u2013 MCG\n6. Geelong vs Fitzroy \u2013 Corio Oval\n\nSo the game in question is between Geelong and Fitzroy, played at Corio Oval on May 30, 1931. The crowd size for that particular row is 9000, as per the table.\n\nWait a minute\u2014wait, no, the claim says \"the game at fitzroy.\" So does the venue have to be Fitzroy? Or is it about the away team being Fitzroy?\n\nLooking again, in the sixth row, the home team is Geelong, and the away team is Fitzroy. The venue is Corio Oval. The crowd for that game was 9000, not 20244.\n\nThe claim says the crowd size was 20244 at Fitzroy. So first, the venue is not Fitzroy\u2014it's Corio Oval. Second, the crowd size doesn't match. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because the crowd size isn't 20244 and the game wasn't at Fitzroy (it was at Corio Oval). Wait, but wait\u2014the claim says \"the game at fitzroy.\" So maybe I misread it\u2014does it mean that Fitzroy is the venue? Because in the table, Fitzroy is an away team for Geelong. The venue would be Corio Oval, not Fitzroy itself.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the crowd size isn't 20244 and the game wasn't at Fitzroy but at Corio Oval.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd size was 20244 at a game in Fitzroy. Upon examining the table, the relevant row for Fitzroy as the away team is Geelong vs. Fitzroy with a crowd of 9000 at Corio Oval. Since neither the venue nor the crowd size matches the claim, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
