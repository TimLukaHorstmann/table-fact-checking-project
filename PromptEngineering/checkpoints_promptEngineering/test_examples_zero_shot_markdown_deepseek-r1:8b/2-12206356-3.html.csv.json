    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"On June 9, the record was 28 - 29 with a loss of mulholland (5 - 6) and an opponent of the Yankee.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The table has several columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. Each row represents a game on a specific date.\n\nThe claim refers to June 9, so I should locate that row in the table. Scanning through, I see there's a row for june 9. That's row number... well, counting from the top, it's the 8th entry (since june 1 is the first). So, row index would be 8.\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim against the table:\n\n1. **Date**: The date in the claim is June 9, which matches the table's june 9. So that's correct.\n\n2. **Opponent**: The claim says \"Yankee.\" Looking at the opponent column for June 9, it indeed states \"yankees.\" So opponent matches.\n\n3. **Record**: The claim mentions a record of 28 - 29. In the table, under june 9, the record is listed as 28 - 29. That's correct.\n\n4. **Loss**: The claim specifies \"mulholland (5 - 6).\" Looking at the loss column for June 9, it says mulholland (5 - 6). So that matches too.\n\nNow, since all parts of the claim are supported by the table data, I think the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, just to be thorough. Are there any discrepancies? For example, sometimes dates might be different if the table has varying day numbers per month, but June only goes up to 30, and June 9 is correctly listed as a specific date.\n\nAlso, checking the scores: on June 9, the score was 7 - 5, which isn't directly part of the claim, so it's not needed for verification. The key pieces are date, opponent, record, and loss, all of which align perfectly.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
