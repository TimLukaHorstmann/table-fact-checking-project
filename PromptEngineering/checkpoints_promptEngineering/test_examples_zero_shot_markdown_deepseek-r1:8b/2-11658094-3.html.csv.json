    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"the location that be found in 1891 and leave in 1975 be hickory , north carolina.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is asking. It's looking for an institution located in Hickory, North Carolina that was founded in 1891 and left in 1975.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if any institution matches these criteria.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Anderson University: Founded 1911, so not 1891.\n- Appalachian State University: Boone, NC, founded 1899. Not Hickory, and while it left in 1967, that's before 1975.\n- Catawba College: Salisbury, NC, founded 1851. Doesn't match location or dates.\n\nCoker College: Hartsville, SC, founded 1908. Not matching.\n\nEast Carolina University: Greenville, NC, founded 1907. Not Hickory.\n\nElon University: Elon, NC, founded 1889. Not the location in question.\n\nGuilford College: Greensboro, NC, founded 1837. Doesn't match.\n\nHigh Point University: High Point, NC, founded 1924. Not Hickory and founded later than 1891.\n\nLenoir-Rhyne University: Hickory, NC. Let's check its founded and left years. It was founded in 1891 and left in 1975. This matches the claim perfectly.\n\nMoving on to ensure there are no others:\n\nLongwood University: Farmville, VA, founded 1839. Not relevant.\nMars Hill College: Mars Hill, NC, founded 1856. Doesn't match location or dates.\nNewberry College: Newberry, SC, founded 1856. Not Hickory.\n\nUNC Pembroke: Pembroke, NC, founded 1887. Not matching.\n\nPresbyterian College: Clinton, SC, founded 1880. Not the right place.\n\nQueens University of Charlotte: Charlotte, NC, founded 1857. Doesn't match location or dates.\nSt Andrews University: Laurinburg, SC, founded 1958. Doesn't fit.\n\nWestern Carolina University: Cullowhee, NC, founded 1889. Not Hickory.\n\nWingate University: Wingate, NC, founded 1896. While close to Hickory, it's a different location and was founded later than 1891.\n\nSo the only institution that meets all criteria is Lenoir-Rhyne University, which is located in Hickory, NC, founded in 1891, and left in 1975.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"left\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the former private member that be found in 1839 and leave in 1975 be hickory , north carolina.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. Let's see:\n\n1. It mentions a \"former private member.\" Looking at the table, each row represents an institution with various attributes like type (private or public). So this refers to a private institution.\n\n2. This member was \"found in 1839.\" The 'founded' column in the table lists when each institution was founded. So I need to find which private institutions were founded in 1839.\n\n3. It \"leave in 1975,\" meaning the institution left the list at some point, perhaps because it closed or merged. The 'left' column indicates the year they left. So we're looking for a private institution that was founded in 1839 and left in 1975.\n\n4. The location is Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find matching institutions:\n\n- Starting from row 0: Anderson University (founded 1911) \u2013 not 1839.\n- Appalachian State Univ (1899) \u2013 private, but left in 1967.\n- Catawba College (1851) \u2013 private, left 1975. But founded in 1851, not 1839.\n- Coker College (1908) \u2013 not matching.\n- East Carolina Univ (1907) \u2013 public.\n- Elon University (1889) \u2013 private, left 1975. Founded in 1889, not 1839.\n- Guilford College (1837) \u2013 private, but left in 1988.\n- High Point University (1924) \u2013 not matching.\n- Lenoir-Rhyne Univ (1891) \u2013 left in 1975, but founded in 1891.\n- Longwood Univ (1839) \u2013 yes, founded in 1839. Now, when did it leave? The 'left' column shows 2003. So that doesn't match 1975.\n- Mars Hill College (1856) \u2013 left in 1975, but founded in 1856.\n- Newberry College (1856) \u2013 left in 1972.\n- UNC Pembroke (1887) \u2013 public.\n- Presbyterian College (1880) \u2013 private. When did it leave? 1972.\n- Queens Univ of Charlotte (1857) \u2013 left in 2013.\n- St Andrews Univ (1958) \u2013 too recent, and location is Laurinburg.\n- Western Carolina Univ (1889) \u2013 public.\n- Wingate University (1896) \u2013 private. When did it leave? 1989.\n\nWait, looking back, I might have missed some. Let me list all the private institutions with their founded year and left year:\n\n- Catawba College: 1851, 1975\n- Coker College: 1908, 2013\n- Elon University: 1889, 1975\n- Guilford College: 1837, 1988\n- High Point Univ: 1924, 1997\n- Lenoir-Rhyne Univ: 1891, 1975\n- Longwood Univ: 1839, 2003\n- Mars Hill College: 1856, 1975\n- Newberry College: 1856, 1972\n- Presbyterian College: 1880, 1972\n- Queens Univ of Charlotte: 1857, 2013\n- Wingate Univ: 1896, 1989\n\nNow, the claim refers to a private institution founded in 1839 that left in 1975. Looking at the list, Longwood University was founded in 1839 and left in 2003, so that doesn't match. Are there any others? I don't see another private institution founded in 1839 in the table. So, maybe there isn't one.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to a private institution that left in 1975 but was founded earlier. But according to the table, none of the private institutions were founded in 1839 and left in 1975 except possibly Longwood, which left later.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because there's no institution in the table that matches those criteria. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not match any institution in the provided table.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
