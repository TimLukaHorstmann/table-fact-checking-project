    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"at least 5 of the player list be play for the united state.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It lists players with their country, score, and to par. The relevant columns here are 'player' and 'country'. Since the claim is about the number of players from the United States, I need to count how many players have \"united states\" listed under their country.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Player is Greg Norman, country Australia.\n2. Row 2: Nick Faldo, England.\n3. Row 3: David Frost, South Africa.\n4. Row 3 again: Phil Mickelson, United States.\n5. Row 5: Lee Janzen, United States.\n6. Row 5 again: Bob Tway, United States.\n7. Row 7: Scott Hoch, United States.\n8. Row 7 again: Scott McCarron, United States.\n9. Row 7 again: Vijay Singh, Fiji.\n10. Row 10: Corey Pavin, United States.\n11. Row 10 again: Ian Woosnam, Wales.\n\nNow, let's count the number of players from the United States:\n\n- Phil Mickelson\n- Lee Janzen\n- Bob Tway\n- Scott Hoch\n- Scott McCarron\n- Corey Pavin\n\nThat makes six players. So there are at least five (in fact, six) players who played for the United States.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, I see that the 'player' column might have duplicates or same players? Or maybe not. Each row represents a different player. For example, t3 has two players: David Frost and Phil Mickelson. So each of these rows is a separate entry.\n\nSo, in total, the United States players are:\n\n1. Phil Mickelson (t3)\n2. Lee Janzen (t5)\n3. Bob Tway (t5)\n4. Scott Hoch (t7)\n5. Scott McCarron (t7)\n6. Corey Pavin (t10)\n\nThat's six players, which is more than five. So the claim that \"at least 5 of the player list be play for the united state\" holds true.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that all these are correctly listed as United States. Scanning through each:\n\n- Phil Mickelson: yes\n- Lee Janzen: yes\n- Bob Tway: yes\n- Scott Hoch: yes\n- Scott McCarron: yes\n- Corey Pavin: yes\n\nSo yes, six players, which is more than five. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which cells are relevant. The columns we looked at were 'player' and 'country'. So for each player from the United States, their row index and column name ('player') should be noted.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include all rows where country is 'united states', along with their row indices.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are six players listed as being from the United States, which is more than five. The relevant cells are those where the player's country is \"united states.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"nick faldo be the only player list who be play for england , while ian woosnam be play for wale.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying the key points in the claim. It states two main things:\n\n1. Nick Faldo is the only player listed who plays for England.\n2. Ian Woosnam plays for Wales.\n\nSo, I need to verify both of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: place, player, country, score, and to par. I'll focus on the 'player' and 'country' columns.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: Is Nick Faldo the only player listed who plays for England?\n\nFrom the table, let's list all players and their countries:\n\n- Greg Norman: Australia\n- Nick Faldo: England\n- David Frost: South Africa\n- Phil Mickelson: United States\n- Lee Janzen: United States\n- Bob Tway: United States\n- Scott Hoch: United States\n- Scott McCarron: United States\n- Vijay Singh: Fiji\n- Corey Pavin: United States\n- Ian Woosnam: Wales\n\nNow, only Nick Faldo is from England. The other players are from various countries but none else are from England. So the first part of the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNext, checking the second part: Does Ian Woosnam play for Wales?\n\nLooking at the table, yes, under 'country', Ian Woosnam is listed as Wales. That's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the entire claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. Since we're checking for players and their countries, the relevant columns are 'player' and 'country'. Specifically, for each player whose country is being discussed.\n\nSo, Nick Faldo's row: row 2 (index 1) under 'player' and 'country'.\nIan Woosnam's row: row 10 (index 9) under 'player' and 'country'.\n\nI think that covers the necessary cells to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"}]}",

That also matches the claim.\n\nNow, are there any other details in the claim that might affect this? The claim specifies \"respectively,\" meaning Greg is at 1 and Nick at 2.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"greg norman be list to have be play for australia , and have - 12 stroke to par.\" There are a few things here I need to verify from the table.\n\nThe first part of the claim is about Greg Norman being listed to play for Australia. So I'll check the 'player' column for Australia. Looking at the table, the first row has Greg Norman under player, country as Australia. That seems correct.\n\nNext, the second part mentions having -12 stroke to par. The 'to par' column in the table shows that Greg Norman's score is \"- 12\". Wait, in the table, it's written as \"- 12\", which I think represents a score of 12 strokes over par, but sometimes scores are shown with a '+' or '-' sign indicating whether they're above or below par. So if it's -12, that would mean he's 12 strokes under par.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each player has their two rounds added together for their total score. For Greg Norman, it's 63 + 69 = 132. The 'to par' is -12, which likely means he scored 12 strokes below par. So that part checks out too.\n\nI should also check if there are any discrepancies or possible errors in the table. For example, in row 1, place is 1, player is Greg Norman, country Australia, score 132, to par -12. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but sometimes 'to par' can be confusing because a lower score indicates better performance. So if someone has a low number like -12, that means they did very well in the tournament, which aligns with Greg Norman being a professional golfer known for his performance, especially in major tournaments like the Masters.\n\nI don't see any issues with the data provided in the table related to Greg Norman's entry. Both aspects of the claim\u2014playing for Australia and having -12 to par\u2014appear to be accurate based on the table.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim seems true because both parts are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"david frost be the only player list who be play for south africa , while vijay singh be play for fiji.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the players and their countries in the table. David Frost is listed in row 3 under the country column as south africa. Vijay Singh is in row 9 with fiji.\n\nNow, checking the claim: it says David Frost is the only player from South Africa. But looking at the table, there's another player from South Africa? Wait, no, let me check each row carefully. The players are:\n\n1. Greg Norman - Australia\n2. Nick Faldo - England\n3. David Frost - South Africa\n4. Phil Mickelson - United States\n5. Lee Janzen - United States\n6. Bob Tway - United States\n7. Scott Hoch - United States\n8. Scott McCarron - United States\n9.

So the claim says he's the only one, which seems correct at first glance.\n\nBut wait, the claim also mentions Vijay Singh and Fiji. Vijay Singh is indeed listed as Fiji, so that part checks out too. The problem might be with the phrasing of \"the only player listed who plays for South Africa.\" But from the table, yes, David Frost is the sole player from South Africa.\n\nSo, putting it together, the claim states two things: David Frost is the only South African player and Vijay Singh is from Fiji. Both are correct based on the table.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if any other players might be from South Africa. Scanning through, no one else is listed as south africa except David Frost. So yes, he's alone there. And Vijay Singh is indeed in fiji.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that David Frost is the only player from South Africa and that Vijay Singh is from Fiji.

The claim says, \"david frost and scott mccarron be list on place 1 and 2, respectively.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. The columns are: place, player, country, score, and to par.

So, David Frost is indeed at place t3, not 1 or 2.\n\nNext, checking Scott McCarron. I'll go through each row again. The first two places are Greg Norman and Nick Faldo. Then, the third row has David Frost and Phil Mickelson. Looking further down, in row 7, there's a Scott Hoch and Scott McCarron tied at t7.

The claim says: \"greg norman be list to have be play for wale , and have - 3 stroke to par.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and see where Greg Norman is listed. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see that row 1 is Greg Norman from Australia. His score is 63 + 69 = 132, and his to par is -12. So, he's in position 1.\n\nNow, let me parse the claim more carefully. It says \"greg norman be list to have be play for wale , and have - 3 stroke to par.\" I think there might be some translation issues or typos here. \"Be list\" probably means \"be listed\" or \"be placed,\" and \"play for wale\" might mean he's supposed to be playing in Wales. Then, having a \"-3 stroke to par\" likely refers to his score.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if Greg Norman is associated with Wales in any way. From row 1, his country is Australia, so that doesn't match Wales. His to par is -12, which isn't -3. So, he's not playing for Wales and his to par isn't -3.\n\nWait, maybe the claim was meant to say something else? Perhaps it's about someone else, but since Greg Norman is the player in question here, we need to check if the claim applies to him. Since he's from Australia and has a to par of -12, the claim doesn't hold for him.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim states that Greg Norman is listed to play for Wales with a score of -3 to par. But according to the table, he plays for Australia with a -12 to par. Therefore, the claim is false because neither part of it matches his actual data in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to verify both parts: Greg Norman's country and his to-par score.\n\n1. **Country**: The claim says \"play for Wales,\" but Greg Norman is from Australia (row 0, column 'country'). This doesn't match.\n2. **Score**: The claim refers to a \"-3 stroke to par.\" Greg Norman's to-par is -12, not -3 (row 0, column 'to par').\n\nSince both conditions in the claim don't align with Greg Norman's data, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Lee Janzen plays for Fiji.\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table provided.\n\nStarting with the first part: Is Ian Woosnam the only player from South Africa? Looking at the 'country' column, I see that the players and their countries are as follows:\n\n- greg norman: australia\n- nick faldo: england\n- david frost: south africa\n- phil mickelson: united states\n- lee janzen: united states\n- bob tway: united states\n- scott hoch: united states\n- scott mccarron: united states\n- vijay singh: fiji\n- corey pavin: united states\n- ian woosnam: wales\n\nWait, in the table, I see that David Frost is from South Africa. That means there's at least one other player besides Ian Woosnam who plays for South Africa. Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect because it says Ian is the only one.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: Lee Janzen plays for Fiji. Looking at the table, Lee Janzen is from the United States. Vijay Singh is the only player listed as playing for Fiji. So this part seems incorrect too because Lee Janzen doesn't play for Fiji; it's actually Vijay Singh.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify each assertion made about the players' countries in the table.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Ian Woosnam is the only player from South Africa.**\n   - From the table, David Frost is also listed as playing for South Africa.\n   - This makes the first part of the claim false.\n\n2. **Lee Janzen plays for Fiji.**\n   - Lee Janzen's country is listed as the United States, not Fiji.\n   - Vijay Singh is the only player from Fiji in the table.\n   - This makes the second part of the claim false.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are incorrect, the overall statement is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- We need to check the cells related to both Ian Woosnam and Lee Janzen's countries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"}, // For Ian Woosnam (row 10)\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}  // For Lee Janzen (row 4)\n  ]\n}\n```",
