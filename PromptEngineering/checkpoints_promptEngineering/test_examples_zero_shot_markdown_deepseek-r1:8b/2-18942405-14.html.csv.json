    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the andrean fighting '59ers have an enrollment of 587.\" \n\nFirst, let me locate the relevant information in the table. The table has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, ihsaa football class, and county.\n\nThe claim mentions \"andrean\" as the school name and specifies the enrollment number as 587. So I should look for the row where the school is \"andrean.\" \n\nLooking at the table, the first row corresponds to Andrean High School. The column under \"enrollment\" here shows 587. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim refers to enrollment and the school name, those two columns (enrollment and school) in that specific row are important. \n\nTherefore, I should check if all parts of the claim are supported by the table. The school is Andrean, and their enrollment is 587 as per the table. There's no discrepancy here.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be for \"enrollment\" at row index 0 and \"school\" at row index 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
