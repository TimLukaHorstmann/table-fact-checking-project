The task is to check each part of the claim against these cells in the relevant rows.\n\nThe claim has two parts: \"trey depriest\" and \"play linebacker.\" I'll need to find Trey Depriest's position in the table to verify if he plays linebacker.\n\nLooking through the table row by row:\n\n- Row 0: Connor McGovern, defensive line\n- Row 1: Kevin McReynolds, defensive line\n- Row 2: Jesse Hayes, defensive line\n- Row 3: Kris Harley, defensive line\n- Row 4: Trey Depriest, linebacker\n- Row 5: Lawrence Thomas, linebacker\n- Row 6: Tre Madden, linebacker\n- Row 7: Derek Watt, linebacker\n- Row 8: Brandon Mullins, linebacker\n- Row 9: Karlos Williams, defensive back\n- Row 10: Doran Grant, defensive back\n- Row 11: Jabriel Washington, defensive back\n\nWait, the claim is about Trey Depriest.

Now, checking his position: it says \"linebacker\" under the position column.\n\nSo Trey Depriest does play linebacker as per the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list which cells were checked. The key columns here are 'player' and 'position'.\n\nFor Trey Depriest, his row is 4, so row_index is 4.

Looking at the 'position' column for row 12, it's listed as \"defensive back\". So that's correct too.\n\nPutting it all together: Jabril Washington attends Trinity Christian Academy and plays defensive back. The table confirms both parts of the claim.

Let me start by carefully looking at the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll search for \"connor mcgovern\" in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that the first entry is:\n\n| connor mcgovern | defensive line | shanley high school | fargo , north dakota | missouri |\n\nOkay, so his high school is listed as Shanley High School, not St John's High School. That seems to contradict the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something? Let me double-check each row again. Nope, only one entry for Connor McGovern, and it's Shanley High School.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"st john 's high school\" with an apostrophe. In the table, under the same column, are there any other schools named \"St John's\"? Let me check all rows:\n\n1. shanley high school\n2. st john 's high school\n3. moeller high school\n4. warren central high school\n5. springfield high school\n6. renaissance high school\n7. mission viejo high school\n8. pewaukee high school\n9. coppell high school\n10. ridge community high school\n11. st vincent st mary high school\n12. trinity christian academy\n\nOh, wait! There's a second row where the school is \"st john 's high school\". But that's for Kevin Mcreynolds, not Connor McGovern.\n\nSo, the claim is saying Connor McGovern went to St John's High School, but according to the table, he went to Shanley High School. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Connor's high school is different from what's stated in the claim.\n\nI don't think there are any relevant cells that support the claim since the only mention of \"St John's\" is for a different player.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Connor McGovern attended St John's High School, but according to the table, he actually went to Shanley High School.

The table has several columns: player, position, school, hometown, and college.

Scanning through each row under the 'player' column, I see that the second row has his name. His position is listed as defensive line, so that's consistent with the claim's context.\n\nNow, checking his hometown: according to the table, Kevin Mcreynolds' hometown is Washington, DC. That matches the first part of the claim, which says he's from Washington DC. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, looking at the college column. The table shows that Kevin attends UCLA, not Virginia Tech. The claim states he goes to Virginia Tech, which doesn't align with what's in the table. This discrepancy is important because it directly contradicts the second part of the claim.\n\nTo make sure I'm thorough, I'll double-check his row index and all relevant columns again. His row is at index 1, columns checked are player, position, school (though not needed here), hometown, and college. The key points are that his hometown matches but college doesn't.\n\nSince one part of the claim is accurate (hometown) but the other (college) isn't, the entire statement isn't fully supported as true.

So this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, let's check the columns for Trey Depriest in row 4. The player's position is listed as \"linebacker,\" which matches the claim's positional aspect. Next, the college column says \"alabama.\" Hmm, that doesn't match Michigan State. \n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. In row 4, under \"college,\" it's Alabama. So Trey Depriest is listed as attending Alabama, not Michigan State.\n\nBut the claim says he is a linebacker at Michigan State. Since his college is Alabama, that part doesn't align with the claim. Also, checking other columns: school is Springfield High School, hometown is Springfield, Ohio. None of these seem to affect the college placement aspect of the claim.\n\nSo, Trey Depriest is indeed a linebacker (position matches) but attending Alabama, not Michigan State. Therefore, the claim that he is a linebacker at Michigan State is false because his college is listed as Alabama.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any rows.

The players are listed with their respective details in each row. My task is to verify whether Brandon Mullins's hometown is Syracuse, New York according to the claim.\n\nI need to locate Brandon Mullins in the table. Scanning through the \"player\" column, I see names like Connor McGovern, Kevin Mcreynolds, Jesse Hayes, Kris Harley, Trey Depriest, Lawrence Thomas, Tre Madden, Derek Watt, Brandon Mullins, Karlos Williams, Doran Grant, and Jabriel Washington. So, Brandon Mullins is one of the players.\n\nNext, I'll find the row where the player is Brandon Mullins. Let's see... It looks like he's in row 9 (if we start counting from 0, it would be index 9). Wait, actually, let me count correctly. The first row is 0, so:\n\nRow 0: Connor McGovern\nRow 1: Kevin Mcreynolds\n...\nRow 8: Tre Madden\nRow 9: Derek Watt\nWait, no, maybe I'm miscounting.

Or perhaps the table starts with header rows? Let me check the original markdown.\n\nThe markdown table has headers: player, position, school, hometown, college. Then each row represents a player's details. So, the first data row is connor mcgovern, which would be row index 0.\n\nSo, let's list all players with their row indices:\n\nRow 0: connor mcgovern\nRow 1: kevin mcreynolds\nRow 2: jesse hayes\nRow 3: kris harley\nRow 4: trey depriest\nRow 5: lawrence thomas\nRow 6: tre madden\nRow 7: derek watt\nRow 8: brandon mullins\nRow 9: karlos williams\nRow 10: doran grant\nRow 11: jabriel washington\n\nWait, so Brandon Mullins is in row 8 (if starting from 0).

The claim says his hometown is \"syracuse , new york\".\n\nComparing these two, \"coppell , texas\" does not match \"syracuse , new york\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that I'm checking the correct row.

However, upon checking the table, his actual hometown is listed as Coppell, Texas. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Player:** Locate Brandon Mullins in the \"player\" column of the table.\n2. **Locate the Row:** Determine the row index for Brandon Mullins, which is 8 (0-based indexing).\n3. **Check the HomeTown Column:** Look at the \"hometown\" value for Brandon Mullins, which is Coppell, Texas.\n4. **Compare with the Claim:** The claim states Syracuse, New York, which does not match Coppell, Texas.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because Brandon Mullins's hometown is Coppell, Texas, not Syracuse, New York.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
