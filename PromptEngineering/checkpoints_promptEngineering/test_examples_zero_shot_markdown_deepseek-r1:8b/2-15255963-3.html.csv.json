    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"On March 13, 1990, play against Dundee and result in 3 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each part of the claim against the table. Let me look at the dates column to see if there's a match for March 13, 1990. Scanning through the date column:\n\n- 26 January 1990\n- 29 January 1990\n- 23 February 1990\n- 13 March 1990\n- 6 April 1991\n- 18 May 1991\n\nYes, there's a match on 13 March 1990. So the date part checks out.\n\nNext, the opponent is Dundee. Looking at the opponent column:\n\n- east fife\n- east fife\n- airdrieonians\n- dundee\n- st johnstone\n- motherwell\n\nYes, there's an entry for Dundee on that specific row. So the opponent matches too.\n\nNow, checking the result. The claim says the result was 3 - 1. In the table, under the result column for 13 March 1990, it shows \"3 - 1\". That's a direct match, so the result part is correct as well.\n\nI don't think there are any other parts of the claim to check because the date, opponent, and result all align with the given row in the table. The attendance and scorers aren't mentioned in the claim, but since they're not required for verification, I can ignore them.\n\nTherefore, all aspects of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two specific things: the opponent is Dundee and the result is 3-4. So I need to look for any row in the table where the opponent column says \"dundee\" and the result column says \"3 - 4.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers. My focus is on the \"opponent\" and \"result\" columns.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to see if there's a match for these two criteria.\n\n1. **Row 0:** Opponent is east fife, result is 1 - 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 1:** Opponent is east fife again, but the result is 2 - 1 \u2192 Still no match.\n3. **Row 2:** Opponent is airdrieonians, result is 2 - 0 \u2192 Not Dundee and not 3-4.\n4. **Row 3:** Opponent is dundee, result is 3 - 1 \u2192 Close, but the result isn't 3-4.\n5. **Row 4:** Opponent is st johnstone, result is 0 - 0 \u2192 No match.\n6. **Row 5:** Opponent is motherwell, result is 3 - 4 \u2192 This matches both criteria: opponent is dundee? Wait, no. The opponent here is motherwell, not dundee. So this row doesn't apply.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake there. Let me check again. The claim says when the opponent is dundee and the result is 3-4. Looking back at the table:\n\n- Row 3: Opponent is dundee but the result is 3 - 1.\n- Any row where opponent is dundee with result 3-4? Let me check each row again.\n\nRow 0: east fife, 1-1 \u2192 No\nRow 1: east fife, 2-1 \u2192 No\nRow 2: airdrieonians, 2-0 \u2192 No\nRow 3: dundee, 3-1 \u2192 Close but not 3-4.\nRow 4: st johnstone, 0-0 \u2192 No\nRow 5: motherwell, 3-4 \u2192 Opponent is motherwell, not dundee.\n\nSo there's no row where the opponent is dundee and the result is 3-4. Therefore, the claim must be false because such a match doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there was a game where the opponent was Dundee with a result of 3-4. By checking each row, none of the games meet both conditions simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
