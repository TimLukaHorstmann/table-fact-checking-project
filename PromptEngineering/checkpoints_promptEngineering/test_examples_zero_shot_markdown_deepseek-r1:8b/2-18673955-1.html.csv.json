    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7\". Hmm, let me parse this carefully. It seems to say that on October 30, 1977, there was no game listed with a week number higher than 7.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game played on a specific date, with details about the week it occurred in.\n\nI need to find all games that were played on October 30, 1977. Looking at the 'date' column: I see several dates around that time. Let me scan through each row's date:\n\n- Week 1: September 19\n- Week 2: September 25\n- Week 3: October 2\n- Week 4: October 9\n- Week 5: October 16\n- Week 6: October 23\n- Week 7: October 30, 1977\n- Week 8 onwards: November dates.\n\nSo the specific date in question is week 7 on October 30. The claim is about games played on October 30, so I should focus on that week.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"no game...that be list greater than week 7\". Wait, \"list\" might be a typo for \"listed\" or perhaps it's referring to being higher than week 7 in numbering. So the question is whether any games played on October 30 (week 7) have a higher week number than 7.\n\nBut wait, each game has a specific week number. Week 7 is the highest numbered week in the table provided because the next weeks are 8 onwards. So if we're looking at the game for week 7 on October 30, that's the latest game in terms of week numbering.\n\nSo the claim is saying that there's no game on that date (October 30) that's listed higher than week 7. Since week 7 is the highest, any games played after week 7 would have a week number greater than 7, but according to the table, the next week is week 8, which was on November 6. So those are separate dates.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The claim might be saying that on October 30 (week 7), there's no game with a higher week number listed. Since all games after week 7 are in weeks 8 and beyond, which took place later in November. Therefore, the game on October 30 is week 7, so none of the other games that week would be higher than 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about whether any games on that date (October 30) have a higher week number than 7. But since it's week 7, no games on that date have a higher week number because all subsequent weeks are in November and have higher numbers but different dates.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the claim is stating that there was no game on October 30, 1977, with a week number greater than 7 listed. Since the game on October 30 is week 7, it's exactly week 7, not higher. So any games after that (weeks 8-14) were played in November and thus wouldn't be on October 30.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are no games on October 30, 1977, with a week number greater than 7 listed.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the one where the date is October 30, 1977. Since that game was week 7, no games on that date have a higher week number.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
