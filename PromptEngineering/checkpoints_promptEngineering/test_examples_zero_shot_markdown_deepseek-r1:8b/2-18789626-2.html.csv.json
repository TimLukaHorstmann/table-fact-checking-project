    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and the data provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that the Mavericks (I assume they're referring to the 'mavericks' team) are the sole team that joined after 1970. So, I need to check if any other teams in the table joined after 1970 or not.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details like city, team name, county, and the years they joined and left. My main focus should be on the 'year joined' column because that's what the claim is about\u2014teams joining after 1970.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to note down the year joined:\n\n1. **Attica (row 0)**: Joined in 1947.\n2. **Delphi Community (row 1)**: Joined in 1947.\n3. **Flora (row 2)**: Joined in 1947.\n4. **Rensselaer Central (row 3)**: Joined in 1947.\n5. **Rossville (row 4)**: Joined in 1947.\n6. **Winamac (row 5)**: Joined in 1947.\n7. **Sheridan (row 6)**: Joined in 1948 and left in 2012. So, joined before 1970 but left later.\n8. **Southwestern (row 7)**: Joined in 1958.\n9. **Western (row 8)**: Joined in 1958.\n10. **Carroll (row 9)**: Joined in 1961.\n11. **Clinton Prairie (row 10)**: Joined in 1961.\n12. **Central Catholic (row 11)**: Joined in 1970.\n13. **Harrison (West Lafayette) (row 12)**: Joined in 1970.\n14. **McCutcheon (row 13)**: Joined in 1975.\n\nSo, focusing on the 'year joined' column, only a few teams have years after 1970:\n\n- Central Catholic (1970)\n- Harrison (West Lafayette) (1970)\n- McCutcheon (1975)\n\nWait, but the claim says \"after 1970,\" which would mean strictly greater than 1970. So 1970 is not after 1970; it's the same year. Therefore, McCutcheon joined in 1975, which is after 1970.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other teams that joined after 1970:\n\n- Central Catholic: Joined in 1970.\n- Harrison (West Lafayette): Joined in 1970.\n- McCutcheon: Joined in 1975.\n\nSo, McCutcheon is the only team that joined strictly after 1970. The claim states \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970.\" From the table, 'mavericks' are associated with McCutcheon (row 13). So McCutcheon is indeed the only team in the list that joined after 1970.\n\nWait a second\u2014am I missing any? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\n- Row 6: Sheridan (joined 1948)\n- Row 7: Southwestern (1958)\n- Row 8: Western (1958)\n- Row 9: Carroll (1961)\n- Row 10: Clinton Prairie (1961)\n- Row 11: Central Catholic (1970)\n- Row 12: Harrison (1970)\n- Row 13: McCutcheon (1975)\n\nNo other teams joined after 1970. Therefore, the Mavericks (McCutcheon) are the only ones that joined after 1970.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because there's only one team\u2014the Mavericks\u2014that joined after 1970.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"year joined\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Rossville School in the table. Looking at the 'school' column, I see that there's an entry for \"rossville.\" That's row index 4, as per the markdown table provided. The columns for this row are: school (which is rossville), city (rossville), team name (hornets), county (12 clinton), year joined (1947), and year left (1977).\n\nThe claim states that Rossville School left the conference 30 years after joining. To verify this, I need to check when they joined and how long they stayed.\n\nRossville joined in 1947, as per the table. If the claim is correct, they should have left in 1947 + 30 = 1977. Looking at the 'year left' column for Rossville, it's indeed listed as 1977. That matches exactly with the calculation from the claim.\n\nWait a second, but I should make sure there are no other factors that might affect this conclusion. For instance, sometimes schools can join and leave conferences multiple times, or the conferences themselves might change structures over time. However, based solely on the information provided in the table, Rossville joined in 1947 and left in 1977, which is exactly 30 years later.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Is there any chance that the 'year left' refers to a different conference? The table doesn't provide information about multiple conferences, so it's safe to assume that this refers to their departure from the original conference they joined. Since the claim specifically mentions \"the conference,\" and there's no indication of multiple departures or conferences, the 1977 year left aligns with leaving after 30 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold true based on the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are for Rossville School, confirming their departure 30 years after joining. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year left\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of schools from different cities and their respective teams, counties, years they joined and left. The claim is: \"the team from the city of attica leave before the team from the city of west lafayette join.\"\n\nFirst, I need to find out which rows correspond to Attica and West Lafayette.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Attica is in row 0 (since it's the first one). It has a team name \"red ramblers\" and left in 1966.\n- West Lafayette: Hmm, looking through the table. There are two entries for Lafayette: southwestern and harrison (west lafayette). Wait, but the claim mentions west lafayette. So that should be row 8 (\"harrison (west lafayette)\"). Their team is \"raidors\" or maybe \"raiders\"? Wait, checking again: the column is \"team name.\" For row 8, it's \"raiders.\"\n\nWait no, looking back: southwestern has wildcats and county 79 tippecanoe. Then harrison (west lafayette) is in row 9? Or wait, let me recount.\n\nLet me list all rows:\n\n0. attica\n1. delphi community\n2. flora\n3. rensselaer central\n4. rossville\n5. winamac\n6. sheridan\n7. southwestern\n8. western\n9. carroll\n10. clinton prairie\n11. central catholic\n12. harrison (west lafayette)\n13. mccutcheon\n\nSo, row 0 is Attica, and row 12 is West Lafayette's team, the raiders.\n\nNow, the claim says that the team from Attica leaves before the team from West Lafayette joins. So I need to check when each of them joined and left.\n\nAttica: Joined in 1947, left in 1966.\nWest Lafayette (harrison): Joined in 1970, left in 1997.\n\nSo, Attica joined in '47, left in '66. Then West Lafayette joined in '70. So Attica left in '66, which is before West Lafayette joined in '70. But wait, the claim says \"leave before...join.\" So Attica's leaving year is before West Lafayette's joining year.\n\nBut I need to make sure that when Attica left, West Lafayette had not yet joined. Since Attica left in 1966 and West Lafayette joined in 1970, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the team from...attica leave before the team from west lafayette join.\" So the leaving of Attica is before the joining of West Lafayette, which is true. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not misunderstanding anything. The claim could also mean that the joining of West Lafayette happens after the leaving of Attica. Yes, 1970 is after 1966. So yes, it's correct.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Attica: row 0, \"year left\" (1966)\n- For West Lafayette: row 12, \"year joined\" (1970)\n\nWait, but the claim is about leaving before joining, so actually, for Attica, we need their year left and for West Lafayette, their year joined.\n\nSo in relevant_cells, I should include both these years.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The instruction says to find which cells are relevant. So for each team mentioned in the claim (Attica and West Lafayette), I need to get their respective columns.\n\nSo:\n\n- Attica: row 0, \"year left\"\n- West Lafayette: row 12, \"year joined\"\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be these two.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other cells that might affect this. For example, perhaps the team from west lafayette's joining year is after attica's leaving year. So yes, 1970 (join) and 1966 (leave). So 1966 < 1970, so it's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, with relevant cells being Attica's year left and West Lafayette's year joined.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year_left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"yearjoined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the hornet be not the only team from 12 clinton county\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that there is more than one team associated with Clinton County. Specifically, it mentions \"the hornet,\" which refers to the Hornets team. The claim suggests that there's another team from Clinton County, meaning the Hornets aren't the sole team representing that county.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to identify all entries related to Clinton County and their respective teams. So, first, I should find out which rows have \"12 clinton\" in the 'county' column because that's where Clinton County is mentioned.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **attica** - county is 23 fountain.\n2. **delphi community** - county is 08 carroll.\n3. **flora** - county is 08 carroll.\n4. **rensselaer central** - county is 37 jasper.\n5. **rossville** - county is 12 clinton.\n6. **winamac** - county is 66 pulaski.\n7. **sheridan** - county is 29 hamilton.\n8. **southwestern** - county is 79 tippecanoe.\n9. **western** - county is 34 howard.\n10. **carroll** - county is 08 carroll.\n11. **clinton prairie** - county is 12 clinton.\n12. **central catholic** - county is 79 tippecanoe.\n13. **harrison (west lafayette)** - county is 79 tippecanoe.\n14. **mccutcheon** - county is 79 tippecanoe.\n\nFrom this, the rows related to Clinton County are row 5 (rossville) and row 11 (clinton prairie). Both have \"12 clinton\" as their county.\n\nNow, focusing on these two rows:\n\n- **Rossville**: Team name is Hornets.\n- **Clinton Prairie**: Team name is Gophers.\n\nSo, both rossville and Clinton Prairie are schools from Clinton County. That means there's more than one team\u2014Hornets and Gophers\u2014from Clinton County. Therefore, the claim that \"the hornet be not the only team from 12 clinton county\" is TRUE because there's another team (Gophers) also from Clinton County.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant here. The columns involved are 'team name' for both rows and the 'county' column to confirm the county is Clinton. So, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. Row 5: Columns 'team name' (Hornets) and 'county' (12 clinton).\n2. Row 11: Columns 'team name' (Gophers) and 'county' (12 clinton).\n\nTherefore, these cells support the claim that there's more than one team from Clinton County.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"team name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"team name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"the school of rossville and clinton prairie leave 3 years apart.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify which schools are involved: Rossville and Clinton Prairie. Looking at the table, I see that both are listed as separate rows. Rossville is in row 5 (if we count from 0), and Clinton Prairie is in row 10.\n\nNext, I need to check their 'year left' values. For Rossville, the 'year left' is 1977. For Clinton Prairie, it's 1974. Wait, that can't be right because 1974 minus 1977 would mean a difference of negative three years, which doesn't make sense in terms of apart. Maybe I'm miscounting rows.\n\nLet me list out the rows with their indices:\n\n0: attica\n1: delphi community\n2: flora\n3: rensselaer central\n4: rossville\n5: winamac\n6: sheridan\n7: southwestern\n8: western\n9: carroll\n10: clinton prairie\n11: central catholic\n12: harrison (west lafayette)\n13: mccutcheon\n\nSo Rossville is row 4, Clinton Prairie is row 10. Their 'year left' values are:\n\nRossville: 1977\nClinton Prairie: 1974\n\nWait, that would make the difference 3 years apart in terms of leaving, but since Clinton left earlier than Rossville, the time between their departures is 1974 to 1977, which is a three-year gap. So the claim says they leave three years apart, and indeed, from Clinton's departure in 1974 to Rossville's in 1977, that's exactly three years.\n\nSo looking at the relevant cells, I need to include the rows for both schools where their 'year left' is listed.

The claim states: \"rensselaer central in rossville , join in 1958 and leave in 1966.\" \n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the table provided and locate the relevant information related to this claim. Let me go through the table row by row to find any entries that match the criteria mentioned.\n\nThe table has several columns: school, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. The claim is about a specific school called \"rensselaer central,\" which should be located in \"rossville.\" It also mentions joining in 1958 and leaving in 1966.\n\nI'll start by looking for the row where the school is \"rensselaer central\" and the city is \"rossville.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first few rows mention other schools like delphi community, flora, rensselaer central, etc. When I get to the fourth row:\n   - School: rensselaer central\n   - City: rensselaer\n   - Team name: bombers\n   - County: 37 jasper\n   - Year joined: 1947\n   - Year left: 1949\n\nHmm, that's not matching because the city is \"rensselaer,\" not \"rossville.\" So this row doesn't fit.\n\nContinuing down, I find another row:\n\n9. carroll\n10. clinton prairie\n11. central catholic\n12. harrison (west lafayette)\n13. mccutcheon\n\nNone of these seem to be rensselaer central in rossville.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it earlier. Let me go back and check each row carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: attica, attica, red ramblers...\n- Row 1: delphi community...\n- Row 2: flora...\n- Row 3: rensselaer central in rensselaer...\n- Row 4: rossville...\n- So on until row 13.\n\nSo the only row where school is \"rensselaer central\" is row 3, but its city is \"rensselaer,\" not \"rossville.\" Therefore, there's no entry for \"rensselaer central\" in \"rossville.\"\n\nSince the claim states that rensselaer central is in rossville and joined in 1958, leaving in 1966, I need to check if such a row exists. But based on the table provided, it doesn't seem like there's an entry for \"rensselaer central\" in \"rossville.\" The closest one is in rensselaer city, which has different details.\n\nMoreover, looking at the years: if such a row existed, it would have to be under the right columns. However, since no such row exists, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence in the table that rensselaer central is located in rossville and joined in 1958, leaving in 1966.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"rensselaer central\" in \"rossville\" joined in 1958 and left in 1966. However, upon examining the table:\n\n1. **School Search**: The only entry for \"rensselaer central\" is located in \"rensselaer,\" not \"rossville.\"\n2. **Year Details**: This row doesn't match the years mentioned (1947-1949 join and leave), so it's unrelated.\n\nThus, no relevant data supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"rossville school in rossville join the conference in 1958 and leave 10 year later.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the school name is \"rossville\". Scanning through the table, I see there's a row with \"rossville\" as the school. That's the fifth row in the table.\n\nNext, I check which columns are relevant. The claim mentions joining in 1958 and leaving ten years later. So, looking at the table headers: year joined and year left. These are the two key columns to verify the claim.\n\nFor the rossville row, the \"year joined\" is listed as 1947. That's not matching the claim which says they joined in 1958. This discrepancy already suggests something might be wrong with the claim. But I should still check all relevant cells to make sure.\n\nThen, looking at the \"year left,\" it shows 1977 for rossville. If they joined in 1947 and left in 1977, that's a span of 30 years, not 10. The claim says they leave ten years after joining, which would mean leaving in 1958 + 10 = 1968, but the actual year is 1977.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the table. For rossville, the \"year joined\" is indeed 1947 and \"year left\" is 1977. So they were part of the conference for 30 years, not 10. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because both the joining year and the duration are wrong.\n\nAdditionally, I should note which cells are relevant. The row index for rossville is 4 (since it's the fifth entry, starting from 0). So row_index 4, columns \"year joined\" and \"year left\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because rossville did not join in 1958 or leave ten years later.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year left\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So that's two teams from Clinton County.\n\nFor Carroll County, under the 'county' column, there are entries like \"08 carroll.\" Let me check each row:\n\n- Delphi Community is in delphi, county 08 carroll.

That's separate.\n\nWait, so Carroll as a school is listed as being from Carroll County. So that makes three teams from Carroll County: Delphi Community, Flora, and Carroll. \n\nTherefore, the claim says only one team from each of these counties joined.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction. The claim says, \"the team from carroll join in 1970 , before harrison (west lafayette) join.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which teams are mentioned in the claim. There's \"carroll\" and \"harrison (west lafayette).\" So, I need to check their respective joining years.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find both teams. Starting from row 0:\n\n- Row 9: carroll, joined in 1961.\n- Row 10: clinton prairie, irrelevant.\n- Row 11: central catholic, irrelevant.\n- Row 12: harrison (west lafayette), joined in 1970.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The claim says carroll joined in 1970 before harrison. But according to the table, harrison joined in 1970 as well. However, looking back:\n\nWait, no, row 12 is harrison (west lafayette) with year joined 1970. And carroll is at row 9, which says \"carroll\" joined in 1961.\n\nSo, if the claim says that carroll joined in 1970 before harrison, but according to the table, carroll joined in 1961 and harrison in 1970. So the claim's timeline doesn't align because carroll joined earlier than 1970, not in 1970.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 9: school is \"carroll,\" year joined is 1961.\nRow 12: school is \"harrison (west lafayette),\" year joined is 1970.\n\nSo carroll joined in 1961 and harrison in 1970, which means carroll joined before harrison. But the claim states that carroll joined in 1970 before harrison, which is incorrect because carroll actually joined earlier.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"the team from carroll join in 1970,\" but according to the table, carroll joined in 1961. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the joining year for carroll is wrong. So, the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check the relevant cells. The columns are: school, city, team name, county, year joined, year left.\n\nFor \"carroll,\" it's row 9, columns: school (row 9), year joined (row 9).\nFor \"harrison (west lafayette),\" it's row 12, columns: school (row 12), year joined (row 12).\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 9, column \"year joined\" for carroll.\n- Row 12, column \"year joined\" for harrison.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, the team from carroll is said to have joined in 1970. However, according to the table, carroll joined in 1961, not 1970. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the joining year of carroll is incorrect, making the entire claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"carroll\" joined in 1970 when, according to the table, it actually joined in 1961. This makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"winamac join 10 year after southwestern join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what the claim is saying. It's stating that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern did. So I need to find out when both winamac and southwestern joined the school.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various details like city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. My focus here is on the \"year joined\" column for winamac and southwestern.\n\nI'll scan through the table to find the relevant rows:\n\n- For winamac: It's in row 6 (index 6) with the details:\n  - school: winamac\n  - city: winamac\n  - team name: warriors\n  - county: 66 pulaski\n  - year joined: 1947\n  - year left: 1972\n\n- For southwestern: It's in row 8 (index 8) with the details:\n  - school: southwestern\n  - city: lafayette\n  - team name: wildcats\n  - county: 79 tippecanoe\n  - year joined: 1958\n  - year left: 1966\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference in years between when winamac joined and when southwestern did. \n\nWinamac joined in 1947, and southwestern joined in 1958. The difference is 1958 minus 1947, which equals 11 years.\n\nThe claim states that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern, but according to my calculation, it was 11 years later. This means the claim is incorrect because the actual time gap is longer than stated\u201411 instead of 10 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
