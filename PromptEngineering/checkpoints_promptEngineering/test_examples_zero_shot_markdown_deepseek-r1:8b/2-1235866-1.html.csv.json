    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the entrant team lotus have 0 point for the year 1963\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to see what exactly needs to be verified. The claim mentions three main elements:\n\n1. **Entrant**: Team Lotus\n2. **Year**: 1963\n3. **Points**: 0\n\nSo, I need to look for an entry in the table where the entrant is Team Lotus, the year is 1963, and the points are 0.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. Let me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Year 1963, Entrant Team Lotus, Chassis Lotus 25, Engine Climax V8, Points 0.\n- **Row 1**: Year 1964, Entrant Team Lotus, etc., Points 11.\n- **Rows 2,3,4**: These are for 1966, so the year doesn't match.\n\nLooking at Row 0, all three criteria are met: entrant is Team Lotus, year is 1963, and points are 0. So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI need to check if any other rows might also be relevant. But since the claim specifically mentions 1963, only that row is relevant. The other entries for 1964 and 1966 don't apply because they're different years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in Row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each row of the table and check if it pertains to the claim. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nThe table has the following columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. The claim is about the 'points' column for team lotus in different years.\n\nStarting with 1963:\n- Year: 1963\n- Entrant: Team Lotus\n- Points: 0\nSo, in 1963, they have 0 points, which is less than 10. That's relevant because it meets the condition of having less than 10 points.\n\nNext, 1964:\n- Year: 1964\n- Entrant: Team Lotus\n- Points: 11\nHere, they have 11 points, which is more than 10. So this doesn't meet the condition and isn't relevant to the claim.\n\nNow, 1966 appears multiple times because there are three entries for that year:\n1. First 1966 entry:\n   - Year: 1966\n   - Entrant: Team Lotus\n   - Points: 1\nAgain, less than 10 points. This is relevant.\n\n2. Second 1966 entry:\n   - Year: 1966\n   - Entrant: Team Lotus\n   - Points: 1\nSame as above, relevant.\n\n3. Third 1966 entry:\n   - Year: 1966\n   - Entrant: Team Lotus\n   - Points: 1\nAlso less than 10, so relevant.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says that 1963 is the only year where team lotus has less than 10 points. But in 1966, there are three entries each with 1 point. So 1966 also has years where they have less than 10 points.\n\nThat means the claim isn't accurate because 1966 also qualifies. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 points\" is incorrect because in 1966, Team Lotus also had entries with less than 10 points (specifically, 1 point each).\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
