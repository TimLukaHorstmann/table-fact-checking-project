    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"from 830 bc , the state be song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions \"from 830 bc,\" which probably refers to a specific row in the table where the year is 830 bc. Then it states that the state is \"song.\" So, I should look for any entries in the table where the 'from' column is 830 bc and check if the corresponding 'state' is song.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find where the 'from' value matches 830 bc. Let me go row by row:\n\n1. cai - 837 bc: Not matching.\n2. cao - 835 bc: No match.\n3. cao - 826 bc: Doesn't match.\n4. chen - 831 bc: Close, but not 830 bc.\n5. chu - 837 bc: No.\n6. chu - 827 bc: No.\n7. chu - 821 bc: No.\n8. jin - 840 bc: No.\n9. jin - 822 bc: No.\n10. lu - 854 bc: No.\n11. lu - 825 bc: No.\n12. qi - 850 bc: No.\n13. qin - 845 bc: No.\n14. qin - 822 bc: No.\n15. song - 830 bc: This matches! The state here is 'song' with from 830 bc.\n\nSo, the claim says that when the year is 830 bc, the state is song. From the table, there's exactly one entry where 'from' is 830 bc, and in that row, the state is indeed 'song'. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries with 'from' as 830 bc to make sure it's not another state. Looking through all the rows, only song has from 830 bc. So no other states share that year.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"state\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It's saying that for the state 'jin', the names 'xi' or 'xian' appear in the 'name' column. So I need to check if there are any entries in the 'name' column under 'jin' with either 'xi' or 'xian'.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different state. The relevant columns for this claim are \"state\", \"name\", and possibly others, but the main ones are state and name.\n\nNow, I'll scan through the 'state' column to find rows where the state is 'jin'. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has state 'cai', so not relevant.\n2. Second row: 'cao' \u2192 not 'jin'.\n3. Third row: 'cao' again \u2192 nope.\n4. Fourth: 'chen' \u2192 no.\n5. Fifth: 'chu' \u2192 no.\n6. Sixth: 'chu' \u2192 no.\n7. Seventh: 'chu' \u2192 no.\n8. Eighth row: state is 'jin' \u2192 this is relevant. Now check the 'name' column here. The name is 'xi'. So that's one possibility.\n\nNext, I'll continue checking other rows for any other 'jin' entries:\n\n9. Ninth row: 'lu' \u2192 not 'jin'.\n10. Tenth: 'lu' \u2192 no.\n11. Eleventh: 'qi' \u2192 no.\n12. Twelfth: 'qin' \u2192 nope.\n13. Thirteenth: 'song' \u2192 no.\n14. Fourteenth: 'wey' \u2192 no.\n15. Fifteenth: 'yan' \u2192 no.\n\nSo the only row where state is 'jin' is row index 8. The name there is 'xi'. Now, does the claim include 'xian'? It says \"xi or xian\". So even if there's another 'jin' entry with 'xian', it would still be true. But in this case, the only 'jin' entry has 'xi'.\n\nWait a second, but looking back at the table, I might have missed some rows. Let me count again to make sure I didn't skip any. The table has 15 rows, and row indices from 0 to 14.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 8: state 'jin', name 'xi' \u2192 relevant.\nIs there another row where state is 'jin'? No, the next one is row 9: 'lu'. So only one 'jin' entry.\n\nTherefore, since 'xi' is present when the state is 'jin', the claim is true because it includes 'xi' as one of the options. Even if 'xian' wasn't present, but here it is not, it's still partially correct.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 8 and column 'name'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this decision. The claim is: \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two conditions:\n\n1. The name is \"yi.\"\n2. The royal house is \"ji.\"\n3. The state is \"cai.\"\n\nSo I'm looking for a row in the table where the 'name' column is \"yi,\" the 'royal house' column is \"ji,\" and the 'state' column is \"cai.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has these columns: state, type, name, title, royal house, from.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if any meet all three conditions.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: state=caI, name=yi, royal house=jI. Wait, that seems to match exactly. So this row is relevant because it has 'yi' as the name, 'ji' as the royal house, and 'cai' as the state.\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows to make sure there's no other entry that might also satisfy or contradict.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- Row 1: state=cao, which doesn't match cai.\n- Row 2: same as row1.\n- Row3: chen, not cai.\n- Rows 4-7: chu, no.\n- Row8: jin, name is xi, royal house ji. So this is a different name, so it's not yi.\n- Rows9-10: lu, no.\n- Rows11-12: qi, no.\n- Row13: qin, no.\n- Row14: song, no.\n- Row15: wey, no.\n- Row16: yan, no.\n\nSo only row0 matches all three conditions. Therefore, the claim is true because there's an entry where the name is yi, the state is cai, and the royal house is ji.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each cell that supports this. So for row0, the columns are: state, type, name, title, royal house, from.\n\nBut the claim talks about the 'name' being yi, 'royal house' being ji, and 'state' being cai. So I should include all three columns where they match in that row.\n\nWait, but each relevant cell is a single column. The instruction says to list the relevant cells as objects with row_index and column_name.\n\nSo for row0, since it's the only one matching, I need to include state, name, and royal house? Or just the ones mentioned in the claim?\n\nThe claim mentions \"name,\" \"royal house,\" and \"state.\" So each of these columns is relevant because they are part of the condition. Therefore, for row0, all three columns are relevant.\n\nSo in the JSON, I need to have:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nThat's the correct approach because each condition is checked in those columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
