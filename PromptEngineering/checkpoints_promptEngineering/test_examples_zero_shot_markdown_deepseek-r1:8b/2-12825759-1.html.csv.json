    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific match is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"When Twickenham Stoop is the venue on 28 March 2009, the score was 22 - 12.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the date is 28 March 2009 and the venue is Twickenham Stoop. Scanning through the table, I see that there's a match on 28 March 2009 at Twickenham Stoop against Harlequins RL with a score of 22 - 12. That seems to match the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the date (row_index 13), venue (row_index 13), opponent (row_index 13), result (row_index 13), and scored (though that's not directly part of the claim). However, since the claim is specifically about the score, I should include only the date, venue, and result columns. \n\nWait, no\u2014the claim includes both the venue and the score. So the relevant cells are the date, venue, and result. Therefore, the row index for 28 March 2009 is 13 (since it's zero-indexed), so row_index=13. The columns involved are \"date\", \"venue\", and \"result\".\n\nBut wait, the table might have row indices starting at 0, so I need to check that. Let me count: looking at the first entry as index 0. So yes, 28 March is indeed row 13.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\":13, \"column_name\":\"date\"}\n- {\"row_index\":13, \"column_name\":\"venue\"}\n- {\"row_index\":13, \"column_name\":\"result\"}\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because all these conditions are met in that particular row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":13, \"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13, \"column_name\":\"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13, \"column_name\":\"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007 , where the score be 22 - 12\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two specific things: the venue and the result (score) for a particular match.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to April 6, 2007. Scanning through the date column:\n\n1. 6 april 2007 - that's the first entry.\n2. The venue for this row is \"twickenham stoop\".\n3. The opponent is Harlequins RL.\n4. The result is 30-28.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says the score was 22-12. But in the table, for April 6, 2007, the score is 30-28. That's not matching at all with 22-12. So already, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the row for 6th April 2007. Yes, it's the first row in the table:\n\n| date             | venue                   | opponent                   | result   | tournament   |   scored |\n|:-----------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|:---------|:-------------|---------:|\n| 6 april 2007     | twickenham stoop        | harlequins rl              | 30 - 28  | super league |        1 |\n\nSo the result is definitely 30-28, not 22-12. That means the score part of the claim doesn't match.\n\nNow, checking if any other rows have a score of 22-12. Let me look through each row:\n\n- 28 March 2009: Venue is twickenham stoop, date is March 28, 2009. The result is 22 -12. Hmm, that's interesting. So in this case, the venue is twickenham stoop on March 28, 2009, with a score of 22-12.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifies April 6, 2007. So even though there's another match at twickenham stoop with a 22-12 score, it doesn't occur on the date specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because both the venue and the result don't align correctly for the given date of April 6, 2007.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on April 6, 2007, at twickenham stoop, the score was 22-12. However, checking the table:\n\n1. The April 6, 2007, entry shows a venue of twickenham stoop but a result of 30-28.\n2. There's another match on March 28, 2009, at twickenham stoop with a score of 22-12.\n\nSince the date and result in the claim don't match the specified April 6 entry, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
