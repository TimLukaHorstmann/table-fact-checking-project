    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"paul pierce lead the team in points for 5 of the 7 games\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Paul Pierce was the top scorer for his team in 5 out of the 7 games listed. That means, across these seven games, there should be at least five instances where Paul Pierce had more points than any other player on his team.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see each row represents a game with details like the date, opposing team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The \"high points\" column lists the player(s) who scored the most in that game.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one to check how many times Paul Pierce was the sole or top scorer.\n\nGame 76: April 1 vs Charlotte. The score is 111-109 in overtime, and Paul Pierce has 32 points, with no other player's points mentioned exceeding that. So, yes, he leads here.\n\nGame 77: April 3 vs Atlanta. Score is 104-92 in OT. Paul Pierce scored 21 points, but I don't see any higher number elsewhere. He leads again.\n\nGame 78: April 8 vs New Jersey. The game goes into OT with a score of 106-104. Here, Rajon Rondo scores 31 points, which is higher than Paul Pierce's unlisted points in this row. So, Paul doesn't lead here.\n\nWait, looking back, the \"high points\" for Game 78 are listed as Rajon Rondo (31). That means he scored more than anyone else, including Paul Pierce. So that's one game where Paul isn't leading.\n\nGame 79: April 10 vs Miami. Score is 105-98 in OT. Paul Pierce has 28 points. The other high scorer is Rajon Rondo with 12 rebounds, but the points aren't mentioned beyond that. Since the \"high points\" column only lists Paul's points here, he leads this game.\n\nGame 80: April 12 vs Cleveland. The team lost 76-107 in OT. High points are 14 by Paul Pierce, but Rajon Rondo also scored higher, perhaps? Wait, the \"high points\" for this game is listed as Paul Pierce (14). So no one else had more than that. Therefore, he leads here.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, Game 80's high points are Paul with 14. But the team lost, and the other team scored 107. However, within their own team, who scored the most? The table only lists Paul as the high scorer in this game. So, yes, he leads here.\n\nWait, but I might be misinterpreting. If the \"high points\" is just for their team, then if it's listed as Paul's points, that means no one else on his team scored more. So regardless of the opponent's total, within their own team, Paul was highest.\n\nSo Game 80: Paul leads.\n\nGame 81: April 14 vs Philadelphia. Score is 100-98 in OT. High points are Paul with 31. No other player's points are higher than that here, so he leads.\n\nGame 82: April 15 vs Washington. They won 115-107 in OT. The high points here are Glen Davis (21). So Paul didn't lead this game; someone else did.\n\nNow, let me count the games where Paul leads:\n\nGame 76: Lead\nGame 77: Lead\nGame 78: Don't lead\nGame 79: Lead\nGame 80: Lead\nGame 81: Lead\nGame 82: Don't lead\n\nThat's six games where he led. Wait, but in Game 80, the team lost, but Paul still had more points than anyone else on his team. So that counts.\n\nBut the claim is about five out of seven. Since there are seven games listed, and Paul leads six, which is more than five, the statement should be true.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each game's high points:\n\n- Game 76: Paul (32)\n- Game 77: Paul (21)\n- Game 78: Rondo (31) \u2192 Paul doesn't lead\n- Game 79: Paul (28)\n- Game 80: Paul (14)\n- Game 81: Paul (31)\n- Game 82: Davis (21)\n\nYes, that's six games where Paul leads. So the claim says five of seven, which is true because he led six.\n\nWait, but the claim is \"lead the team in points for 5 of the 7 games.\" So since it's at least five, yes, it's true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"rajon rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the relevant columns in the table. The important ones here are 'high assists' and 'team'. So, I'll focus on those two columns.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 76: Rajon Rondo has 9 assists.\n- Row 77: He has 6 assists.\n- Rows 78 and 79: His assists are lower in these games as well.\n- In row 80, he has 6 assists.\n- Row 81: There's a mention of Stephon Marbury with 5 assists, but nothing about Rajon Rondo.\n\nWait, the claim says \"most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game.\" So I need to see if Rondo ever had exactly 12 assists in any single game listed here. From the table, his highest is 9 in row 76, and he doesn't reach 12 in any other game.\n\nAlso, the team column shows 'charlotte', 'atlanta', etc., but not 'celtic.' So maybe there's a confusion with teams here. The team listed isn't the Celtics, so perhaps that's an issue too.\n\nTherefore, even if Rondo had 12 assists somewhere, since it's not for the Celtics, the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Rajon Rondo never recorded 12 assists in any game shown, and the team mentioned isn't the Celtics. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 76, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 76, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the Celtics win 6 of their 7 games during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the Celtics won 6 out of their 7 games in a certain period. So my task is to look through the provided table and check if there's enough information supporting this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, team, score, high points, etc. The relevant columns for determining wins are \"game\" (which seems to be an identifier), \"date,\" \"team,\" and \"score.\" Since the claim is about the Celtics winning games, I should focus on rows where the \"team\" column is \"Celtics.\"\n\nWait a minute, looking at the table, the team names listed are Charlotte, Atlanta, New Jersey, Miami, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Washington. There's no row with the team as \"Celtics.\" That might be a problem because if the Celtics aren't even in the table, then they can't have won any games here.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe the table is incomplete or the Celtics are referred to by another name? No, the claim specifically mentions the Celtics, and none of the teams in the table are Celtics. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Celtics\" refers to a different team, but no, in the context of basketball, the Celtics are a well-known team. So if they're not in the table, then the claim is about something that didn't happen here.\n\nBut wait, could the user have made a mistake? Like, perhaps the table should have included the Celtics, but for some reason it's missing. Or maybe the table includes other games, and I'm supposed to infer based on other data. But without the Celtics in any row, they can't have won any games in this stretch.\n\nSo, considering all that, since there are no Celtics games in the table, the claim is not supported by the given data. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic win all of the game they play at td bank north garden",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the Celtics win all of the game they play at TD Banknorth Garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and the claim. The table has several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, etc., and one of those columns is location attendance, specifically \"TD Banknorth Garden\". The claim says that whenever the Celtics play at TD Banknorth Garden, they win all their games there. So I need to check if in every game listed where the venue is TD Banknorth Garden, the Celtics won.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Game 76: April 1 vs Charlotte. Location is TD Banknorth Garden, and the result is a win (111-109). Celtics won.\n2. Game 77: April 3 vs Atlanta. Same location, same result\u2014win (104-92).\n3. Game 78: April 8 vs New Jersey. Win again (106-104 in OT).\n4. Game 79: April 10 vs Miami. Again, win (105-98 in OT).\n5. Game 80: April 12 vs Cleveland. This is a loss (76-107). So Celtics lost here.\n6. Game 81: April 14 vs Philadelphia. Win (100-98 in OT).\n7. Game 82: April 15 vs Washington. Win (115-107 in OT).\n\nWait, so not all games at TD Banknorth Garden are wins. Specifically, game 80 was a loss. Therefore, the claim that they win all their games there is FALSE.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be \"location attendance\" and \"score\". For each row where location is \"TD Banknorth Garden\", we check if the score shows a win (i.e., the team's record is higher than the opponent's). But in game 80, it's a loss, so that cell is important.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all rows where location is TD Banknorth Garden. From the table, that's row indices 0 to 4 and 6 (since game 80 is row index 4? Wait, let me count: the first game is 76 at row index 0, then 77 (1), 78(2),79(3),80(4),81(5),82(6). So yes, rows 0-3 and 6 have TD Banknorth Garden. But in row 4, game 80, they lost.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all \"location attendance\" and \"score\" columns for those rows. Additionally, maybe also the result column? Because it shows whether they won or not.\n\nWait, the table has a column called \"record\". Let me check: yes, the last column is \"record\", which seems to be their overall season record, but perhaps it's better to look at the score outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the \"score\" itself can indicate win or loss.\n\nSo for each row where location is TD Banknorth Garden:\n\n- Rows 0: Win\n- Row1: Win\n- Row2: Win\n- Row3: Win\n- Row4: Loss\n- Row6: Win\n\nSince not all are wins, the claim is false. So I need to include all these rows as relevant because they directly contradict the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are those where location is TD Banknorth Garden and their corresponding score outcomes.\n</think>\n\nThe Celtics do not win all games at TD Banknorth Garden since they lost game 80 against Cleveland. Relevant cells include the location and outcome for each occurrence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by paul pierce.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various statistics. The key columns here are 'high points' and the 'team'. Since the claim is about a Celtics player, I'll focus on rows where the team is Boston Celtics or simply referred to as \"celtic\" (though in the table, it's listed as 'charlotte', 'atlanta', etc., so perhaps it's a typo or refers to a specific team). Wait, checking the table, I see the teams are Charlotte, Atlanta, New Jersey, Miami, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Washington. There's no row with the Celtics team. This is confusing because the claim mentions \"Celtic\" player, but in the table, it's about other teams like Charlotte, Atlanta, etc.\n\nWait a second\u2014maybe I'm misinterpreting something. The table might be from a different context or perhaps it's a typo. But according to the given table, all games are against other teams, not the Celtics. So if the claim is about a Celtics player, there might be no relevant data in this table.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the 'high points' column for each game to see if any player scored 32 points in a single game. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 76: Paul Pierce has 32 high points.\n- Row 77: Paul Pierce has 21.\n- Row 78: Rajon Rondo has 31.\n- Row 79: Paul Pierce has 28.\n- Row 80: Paul Pierce has 14.\n- Row 81: Paul Pierce has 31.\n- Row 82: Glen Davis has 21.\n\nSo, in game 76, Paul Pierce scored the highest with 32 points. But wait, the claim is about a \"Celtic\" player. However, in the table, none of these games are against the Celtics; they're all against other teams like Charlotte, Atlanta, etc. So if the claim is referring to a game where a Celtic player achieved this, but in the table, there's no such game listed, then the claim might be false because there's no data supporting it within the provided table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete, and the Celtics' games are not included. Therefore, the highest point total by a Celtics player isn't present here to verify the claim.\n\nWait, but let me read the claim again: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by paul pierce.\" So it's about a specific game where Paul Pierce, as a Celtic, scored 32. But according to the table, Paul Pierce was on the Charlotte team, not the Celtics. Therefore, this claim can't be supported by the data provided because there are no games in the table involving the Celtics.\n\nSo, even though Paul Pierce did score 32 points in game 76, that's when he was with Charlotte, not the Celtics. Hence, the claim is about a Celtics player scoring 32 points in a single game, but the table doesn't have such data. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of a Celtics player (specifically Paul Pierce) scoring 32 in any game listed here.\n\nAlternatively, if the team names are mislabeled and \"celtic\" refers to the Boston Celtics, then this table still doesn't include their games, so the data isn't present to support the claim. Therefore, regardless, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about a Celtics player scoring 32 points in a single game, but the provided table includes only other teams, not the Celtics. Even though Paul Pierce scored 32 for Charlotte, this doesn't apply to the Celtics.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"paul pierce lead the team in point for 6 of the 7 games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It states that Paul Pierce was the leading scorer in 6 out of the 7 games listed. So, my goal is to check each game and see how many times Paul Pierce actually led in points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game (from 76 to 82), with various details including the date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location, attendance, and record. The \"high points\" column lists the player(s) who scored the most points in that game.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. **Game 76**: The high points are attributed to Paul Pierce with 32 points.\n2. **Game 77**: Again, Paul Pierce is listed as the leading scorer with 21 points.\n3. **Game 78**: This game's high points are from Rajon Rondo with 31 points. Paul Pierce isn't listed here, so he didn't lead this game.\n4. **Game 79**: Paul Pierce scores 28 points, making him the top scorer.\n5. **Game 80**: The leading scorer is Paul Pierce again, with 14 points.\n6. **Game 81**: High points go to Paul Pierce with 31 points.\n7. **Game 82**: Glen Davis is listed as the leading scorer with 21 points, not Paul Pierce.\n\nNow, let's count how many times Paul Pierce led: he leads in games 76, 77, 79, 80, and 81.

So I need to find in the table where Kendrick Perkins has 12 assists in a single game.\n\nI'll go through each row (game) and check the 'high assists' column because that's where assists are recorded. \n\nRow 76: Game 76 on April 1 against Charlotte, high assists are 9 by Rajon Rondo. No mention of Kendrick Perkins here.\n\nRow 77: Game 77 on April 3 vs Atlanta, high assists again by Rondo with 6.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the celtic lose all of the game they play at td bank north garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then check against the table.\n\nFirst, the Celtics are one of the teams in the games listed. The location mentioned is \"td banknorth garden,\" which I believe is also known as TD BankNorth Garden, probably referring to their home arena. So the claim is about all the Celtics' games played at this venue ending in losses for them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details: date, opposing team, score, etc. The column \"location attendance\" mentions where each game was held, which could be useful because the claim is specifically about games at TD BankNorth Garden.\n\nI'll go through each row and see if the Celtics lost all their home games there. From the table:\n\n- Game 76: Celtics (Charlotte) - They won.\n- Game 77: Celtics (Atlanta) - They won.\n- Game 78: Celtics (New Jersey) - They won.\n- Game 79: Celtics (Miami) - They won.\n- Game 80: Celtics (Cleveland) - They lost.\n- Game 81: Celtics (Philadelphia) - They won.\n- Game 82: Celtics (Washington) - They won.\n\nWait, the claim says they lose all games at TD BankNorth Garden. But looking at the table, I need to check which games were played there. The \"location attendance\" column shows \"td banknorth garden\" for games 76, 77, 78, 79, and 82. So those are their home games.\n\nIn those five games, Celtics results are:\n\n- Game 76: Win\n- Game 77: Win\n- Game 78: Win\n- Game 79: Win\n- Game 82: Win\n\nSo they didn't lose any of these home games. Therefore, the claim that they lost all games at TD BankNorth Garden is FALSE because in reality, they won all their home games listed here.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. The location attendance column shows where each game was played, so row indices 0,1,2,3,4 (since Game 82 is the fifth one). So for rows 0 through 4, and column \"location attendance,\" these are the cells that show the Celtics played at TD Banknorth Garden.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because they didn't lose any of those games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic lose 6 of their 7 game during this stretch",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the Celtics lose 6 of their 7 games during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The table has several columns: game number (game), date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game played by the Celtics during this stretch.\n\nThe claim says that the Celtics lost 6 out of their 7 games in this period. So I need to count how many times they lost versus how many they won or tied.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Game 76: They won against Charlotte with a score of 111 - 109 (in OT). So that's a win.\n- Game 77: They won against Atlanta with 104 - 92 (OT). Another win.\n- Game 78: They won against New Jersey with 106 - 104 (OT). Win again.\n- Game 79: They won against Miami with 105 - 98 (OT). That's another win.\n- Game 80: They lost to Cleveland, 76 - 107 (OT). So that's a loss.\n- Game 81: They won against Philadelphia, 100 - 98 (OT). Win.\n- Game 82: They won against Washington, 115 - 107 (OT). Another win.\n\nWait, but according to the table, from game 76 to game 82, there are 7 games. Let me list them out with their outcomes:\n\n1. Game 76: Win\n2. Game 77: Win\n3. Game 78: Win\n4. Game 79: Win\n5. Game 80: Loss\n6. Game 81: Win\n7. Game 82: Win\n\nSo in these 7 games, the Celtics have 1 loss and 6 wins. That means they lost only once. The claim says they lost 6 out of 7, which isn't matching. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells that support this conclusion. Since we're checking the number of losses, I need the 'record' column or perhaps the 'score' to see who won each game. The 'record' column shows the team's overall record after each game, but it might not directly show wins and losses for each individual game.\n\nWait, the 'score' could indicate a win or loss. For example, if the score is something like \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\", then that's a win. If it's \"l 76 - 107 (ot)\", that's a loss.\n\nSo to check losses, I should look at each game's outcome. Therefore, the relevant cells are the 'game' and 'score' columns because they indicate whether each game was a win or loss.\n</think>\n\nThe Celtics have only one loss in seven games during this stretch, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest point total for a Celtic player in one game be 32, by Stephon Marbury.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find all instances where a Celtic player scored 32 points in a single game. Let's go row by row.\n\nLooking at row 76: It mentions Paul Pierce with 32 points. So that's one instance where someone scored 32 points.\n\nRow 77 has Paul Pierce again, but this time he scored 21 points. That's lower than 32, so not relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 78: Rajon Rondo scored 31 points, which is close but not 32. So this doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 79: Paul Pierce scored 28, which is still below 32.\n\nRow 80: Paul Pierce scored 14 points, way lower.\n\nRow 81: Paul Pierce scored 31, again just under 32.\n\nRow 82: Glen Davis scored 21 points. Not relevant.\n\nSo the only instance where a player scored 32 points in one game is row 76, where it's Paul Pierce, not Stephon Marbury. \n\nNow, looking at Stephon Marbury, I check each row to see if he scored 32 points. In row 78, he has 5 assists but no points listed for him. Row 81 mentions him as having 5 assists again, and others don't list him scoring 32.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the table. For example, in row 76, it's Paul Pierce with 32 points. In other rows, like row 78, Rajon Rondo scored 31, but Stephon Marbury isn't listed as scoring that high anywhere.\n\nTherefore, there is no game where Stephon Marbury scored 32 points for the Celtics. The highest point total by a Celtic player in one game is actually Paul Pierce with 32 points, not Marbury. So the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly attributes the 32-point game to Marbury instead of Paul Pierce.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Stephon Marbury had a game with 32 points for the Celtics, but according to the table, Paul Pierce achieved this in Game 76.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"high points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
