    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the new Trabzon stadium's capacity is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"the new trabzon stadium have a capacity of 41513 people.\" The key elements here are \"new trabzon stadium\" and the capacity figure mentioned, which is 41,513.\n\nI'll start by scanning the table provided to find any rows that match both the stadium name and the capacity. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Row 0**: Timsah Arena, Bursa - Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 1**: Vodafone Arena, Istanbul - No.\n3. **Row 2**: New Konya Stadium, Konya - Not Trabzon.\n4. **Row 3**: New Trabzon Stadium, Trabzon - This seems promising. Let me check the capacity here. According to the table, it's 41,513. That matches exactly with the claim.\n   \nWait, but I notice that there's another row, number 14: Ay - Y\u0131ld\u0131z Stadium, Karab\u00fck. That also has a capacity of 25,000 and is in Karab\u00fck, so not relevant.\n\nAnother thing to check: sometimes tables might have multiple entries for the same stadium but different years or names. In this case, the new Trabzon Stadium is listed with 41,513. There's no other entry for Trabzon that I can see except row 3 and row 14 (which is a different city).\n\nSo, row 3 directly corresponds to the New Trabzon Stadium with a capacity of 41,513. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nI also need to ensure there are no conflicting entries or any other stadium with similar names that might have a different capacity. From the table provided, it seems like only row 3 and possibly row 14 (which is in Karab\u00fck) could be confused, but they're different cities.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim about the New Trabzon Stadium's capacity is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as the New Trabzon Stadium has a listed capacity of 41,513. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015 be new trabzon stadium that hold 41513.\" So, the claim is making two main points. One, there's a stadium called New Trabzon Stadium opened after 2015 with the highest capacity among all stadiums listed. Two, its capacity is 41,513.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find out which stadiums were opened after 2015 and their capacities.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows have an opening year greater than 2015. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Timsah Arena: 2014 (not after 2015)\n- Vodafone Arena: 2015 (not after 2015)\n- New Konya Stadium: 2014\n- New Trabzon Stadium: 2016 (after 2015)\n- New Eski\u015fehir Stadium: 2015\n- Stadyum Samsun: 2016\n- New Gaziantep Stadium: 2016\n- New Antalya Stadium: 2016\n- New Sakarya Stadium: 2016\n- Malatya Arena: 2015\n- New Sivas Stadium: 2015\n- Afyonkarahisar Stadium: 2014\n- Ba\u015fak\u015fehir Stadium: 2014\n- Ay-Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Stadium: 2014\n- New Sakarya Stadium: 2015\n- New Turgutlu Stadium: 2014\n\nSo, the stadiums opened after 2015 are:\n\n1. New Trabzon Stadium (2016)\n2. Stadyum Samsun (2016)\n3. New Gaziantep Stadium (2016)\n4. New Antalya Stadium (2016)\n5. New Sakarya Stadium (2016)\n\nNow, I need to check their capacities.\n\nNew Trabzon Stadium has a capacity of 41,513. Let's compare this with the others:\n\n- Stadyum Samsun: 34,658\n- New Gaziantep Stadium: 33,200\n- New Antalya Stadium: 33,000\n- New Sakarya Stadium: 25,000\n\nClearly, New Trabzon Stadium has the highest capacity among those opened after 2015. So, it's the one with the largest capacity in that subset.\n\nTherefore, the claim states correctly that New Trabzon Stadium is the one with the largest capacity opening after 2015, and its capacity is indeed 41,513.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't miss any other stadium opened after 2015. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each row again for opening year > 2015:\n\n- New Trabzon Stadium: 2016\n- Stadyum Samsun: 2016\n- New Gaziantep Stadium: 2016\n- New Antalya Stadium: 2016\n- New Sakarya Stadium: 2016\n\nThese are the only ones. So, among them, New Trabzon is the one with the highest capacity.\n\nHence, the claim seems to be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The \"new trabzon stadium\" opened in 2016 with a capacity of 41,513, which is the largest among all stadiums listed after 2015.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"opening\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"in trabzon, the lowest capacity match have a capacity of 11'000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided to see if there's a stadium in Trabzon with a capacity of 10,000. Let me scan through each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the 'city' column, I see Trabzon is listed as one of the cities. Now, looking for the corresponding row under 'city' being Trabzon. The rows are:\n\n1. bursa\n2. istanbul\n3. konya\n4. trabzon\n5. eski\u015fehir\n6. samsun\n7. gaziantep\n8. antalya\n9. adapazar\u0131\n10. malatya\n11. sivas\n12. afyonkarahisar\n13. istanbul\n14. karab\u00fck\n15. sakarya\n16. turgutlu\n\nSo, the row for Trabzon is row index 4.\n\nNow, looking at the 'capacity' column for row 4: it's 41513. Hmm, that's much higher than 10,000. So, according to the table, the capacity in Trabzon is 41,513.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim mentions \"the lowest capacity match.\" Does this mean I need to check if there are multiple stadiums in Trabzon? From the table, I only see one stadium for Trabzon: New Trabzon Stadium with a capacity of 41513. There's no other stadium listed under Trabzon.\n\nSo, the lowest capacity match would be the same as the only match in Trabzon, which is 41,513. Since this doesn't reach 11,000, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there isn't a stadium in Trabzon with a capacity of 10,000 or less.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in Trabzon, the lowest capacity match has 11,000 seats. Checking the table, Trabzon's stadium has a capacity of 41,513, which is higher than 11,000.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}",
