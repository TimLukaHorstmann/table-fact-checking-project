    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"On December 4, a game was played at the North Shore Event Centre.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the date in the claim. It's December 4th. So I should focus on the row where the date is December 4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The first step is to find which row corresponds to December 4. \n\nChecking the dates:\n- Row 0: December 3\n- Row 1: December 4\n- Row 2: December 5\n- etc.\n\nSo Row 1 is December 4. Now I need to check the venue for that row. The 'venue' column in Row 1 is \"north shore events centre.\" Wait, the claim says \"North Shore Event Centre\" without the 's' in 'events.' Hmm, but in the table it's \"north shore events centre.\" So there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nBut maybe the venue names can vary slightly. Let me check the exact wording. The claim is \"North Shore Event Centre,\" while the table has \"north shore events centre.\" The case and the addition of an 's' are different. Is this significant?\n\nI think it's important because if the claim exactly matches the venue name, then it's true; otherwise, not. Since the names don't match exactly, maybe the claim is false.\n\nWait, but sometimes venues might have slight variations in naming. However, since the claim specifically mentions \"North Shore Event Centre\" without the 's,' and the table lists it as \"north shore events centre,\" they don't match exactly. Therefore, the venue doesn't fully support the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any game on December 4 at that venue in the table. Yes, Row 1 has a game with New Zealand Breakers vs Townsville Crocodiles at the north shore events centre. So the game was played, but the exact venue name differs from the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the venue names don't match exactly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the game at the north shore event centre be play on december 4\". Wait, I think there might be a typo here. It probably should be \"be played\" or maybe \"played on December 4th\". But regardless, the main points are that there was a game held at the North Shore Event Centre and it occurred on December 4.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different date and the corresponding game details. The columns include date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. So I need to look for any row that matches both the venue and the date mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. December 3: Venue is Win Entertainment Centre. Not relevant.\n2. December 4: Venue is North Shore Events Centre. The date is December 4. This seems to match both criteria\u2014venue and date from the claim.\n3. December 5 onwards: Venues don't include North Shore, so not relevant.\n\nSo, row index 1 (since it's zero-indexed) corresponds to December 4 with the venue as North Shore Events Centre. Therefore, this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might match, but in this case, only December 4th at North Shore fits. So the relevant cells would be the ones for row 1 and column \"venue\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"On December 4, a game be play at the distinctive home dome event center.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check the table for December 4. Looking at the 'date' column, the fourth row is December 4th. Now, under that date, there's an entry where the home team is the New Zealand Breakers and they played against the Townsville Crocodiles. The venue listed is the North Shore Events Centre.\n\nThe claim mentions \"distinctive home dome event center.\" I'm comparing this to the venues in the table. The North Shore Events Centre doesn't match that name. So, the venue isn't as stated in the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check if there was a game on December 4 at any venue matching the description. The only entry for December 4 is at North Shore Events Centre, which doesn't match \"distinctive home dome event center.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells: For December 4, the row index is 3 (since it's the fourth row). The columns to check are 'date', 'home team', and 'venue'. So, I'll list those as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the match played on december 4 recorded a score of 102 - 94 with north shore event centre as its venue.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions three specific things:\n1. The date is December 4.\n2. The score was 102 - 94.\n3. The venue was the North Shore Events Centre.\n\nI'll need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. Each row represents a different match on consecutive dates from December 3 to December 7.\n\nStarting with the date: December 4. I'll scan each row for the date \"4 december\". The second row (row index 1) has that date. So, row 1 is relevant because it's the date in question.\n\nNext, the score: 102 - 94. I need to find a match where home or away team scored 102 and the other 94. Looking at each row:\n- Row 0: Wollongong Hawks (78) vs South Dragons (112)\n- Row 1: New Zealand Breakers (88) vs Townsville Crocodiles (104)\n- Row 2: Cairns Taipans (78) vs Sydney Spirit (92)\n- Row 3: Adelaide 36ers (102) vs Melbourne Tigers (94)\n- So, row 3 has the score of 102 - 94. Therefore, this row is relevant for the score part.\n\nNow, the venue: North Shore Events Centre. I'll look through each venue column to see if that's listed. Scanning row by row:\n- Row 0: Win Entertainment Centre\n- Row 1: North Shore Events Centre (this matches)\n- So, row 1 is also relevant for the venue.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says the match on December 4 had the score 102 -94 at North Shore Events Centre. But according to the table, row 1 has date December 4, venue North Shore Events Centre, and the score was 88-104, not 102-94.\n\nHold on, in row 3, which is December 6, the score is 102-94, but that's a different date. So, the claim is confusing the dates. On December 4 (row1), the score was 88-104, not 102-94. And the venue for December 4 (row1) is correct as North Shore Events Centre.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while the venue matches, the date and score do not align correctly for that specific row. The claim incorrectly associates the 102-94 score with December 4, but it actually occurred on a later date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on December 4, the match had a score of 102-94 at North Shore Events Centre. However, checking the table:\n- December 4 (row1) has a score of 88-104, not 102-94, and venue is correct.\n- The 102-94 score occurs on December 6 (row3), a different date.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the details don't match correctly for December 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
