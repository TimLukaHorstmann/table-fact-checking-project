The main points are:\n\n1. \"French\" is the language used.\n2. It's related to the film title used in the nomination for \"r\u00e9fractaire.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the film title is \"r\u00e9fractaire.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- 1997: \"elles\"\n- 1998: \"back in trouble\"\n- 2003: \"i always wanted to be a saint\"\n- 2005: \"renart the fox\"\n- 2006: \"your name is justine\"\n- 2007: \"little secrets\"\n- 2008: \"nuits d'arabie\"\n- 2009: \"r\u00e9fractaire\"\n\nSo, the relevant row is the 2009 (82nd) ceremony.

The table has several columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions the original title \"le roman de renart\" and specifies that it has \"1 language.\" So, I should focus on the \"original title\" and \"languages\" columns for this row. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the original title is \"le roman de renart.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- 1997: Original title is \"elles\"\n- 1998: \"back in trouble\"\n- 2003: \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\"\n- 2005: \"le roman de renart\"\n- 2006: \"your name is justine\"\n- 2007: \"perl oder pica\"\n- 2008: \"nuits d'arabie\"\n- 2009: \"r\u00e9fractaire\"\n\nSo, the row in question is 2005 (78th), which has original title \"le roman de renart.\"\n\nNext, I need to check the \"languages\" column for this specific row.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"renart the fox be in polish and english\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it says that \"renart the fox\" was submitted in both Polish and English. To verify this, I should check the relevant cells in the table for each part of the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column called \"film title used in nomination\". The entry for 2005 (78th) is \"renart the fox\", so that's definitely the film in question. This means row index 4, column_name \"film title used in nomination\" is relevant because it directly mentions the film title.\n\nNext, I need to check if this film was submitted in both Polish and English. In the same row (row index 4), there's a column called \"languages\". The entry here is \"french\", which means that the original language of the film is French. However, the claim says it was submitted in Polish and English.\n\nWait, but the table also has another column: \"original title.\" For row 4, the original title is \"le roman de renart,\" which is French. So the original language is French. But the \"film title used in nomination\" is \"renart the fox.\" The languages for this film entry are only listed as \"french.\"\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check the table again. For row 4 (2005), languages are just \"french,\" not Polish or English. So that means the claim about it being in Polish and English isn't supported by the data here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The column \"languages\" usually refers to the languages of the original title, not necessarily all languages used in submission. However, looking at the other rows, sometimes only one language is listed, but sometimes two. For example, row 2006 has Polish and English for the film \"your name is justine.\" So maybe the \"languages\" column indicates the languages used in the film's submission.\n\nIn row 4, it says \"french,\" so that would mean \"renart the fox\" was submitted as a French film. Therefore, the claim about it being submitted in both Polish and English is incorrect because only French is listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the columns. The original title for row 4 is \"le roman de renart,\" which is in French, but the film title used in nomination is \"renart the fox.\" Maybe \"renart the fox\" was translated into other languages for the purposes of submission? But the table doesn't show any additional languages beyond what's listed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at how other films are handled. For example, in row 2006, \"your name is justine\" is submitted in Polish and English, but the original title is in French. So it seems like the film title used in nomination can be different from the original, and the languages column might refer to the original.\n\nBut no, actually, looking at row 2006: The film title is \"your name is justine,\" which is in English, but the original title is \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte,\" which is French. So perhaps the \"languages\" column refers to the languages of the submission, not necessarily the original.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because for row 2006, languages are Polish and English, but the film title used in nomination is \"your name is justine,\" which is in English. Maybe the \"languages\" column indicates all languages used in the film's submission. So if a film was submitted in multiple languages, they list them here.\n\nIn that case, for row 2005, \"renart the fox\" was submitted only in French, as per the languages column. Therefore, it wasn't submitted in Polish or English as the claim suggests.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim says \"renart the fox be in polish and english.\" Looking at row 4, the film title is \"renart the fox,\" but the languages listed are only French. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the film was not submitted in Polish or English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of the columns. Let me double-check each column's meaning to be sure.\n\n- year (ceremony): The year when the submission happened.\n- film title used in nomination: The title under which the film was submitted.\n- original title: The actual title of the film.\n- languages: The languages in which the film was submitted, I believe. Because for row 2006, it's listed as Polish and English, and the film title is \"your name is justine,\" which could be in those languages.\n\nSo yes, \"languages\" probably refers to the languages used in submission. Therefore, for row 4, only French is listed. So the claim that it was submitted in Polish and English is false.\n\nBut wait, let me check other rows again to ensure I'm interpreting correctly. For example, row 2006: film title is \"your name is justine,\" which might be the English version, but original title is in French. Languages are listed as Polish and English, so perhaps the submission included both languages. Therefore, it's possible that \"renart the fox\" was submitted only in French.\n\nSo, to sum up: The claim says \"renart the fox\" was submitted in both Polish and English. However, according to the table, it was submitted only in French. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because \"renart the fox\" was submitted only in French, not Polish or English.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"your name is justine be in french\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to verifying the claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It seems like it's asserting that the film titled \"your name is justine\" was submitted for consideration at a particular ceremony (probably the Oscars) in French. So, the key elements here are:\n\n1. **Film Title**: \"your name is justine\"\n2. **Language(s)**: French\n3. **Ceremony Year**: The specific year when the film was nominated or disqualified.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to scan each row to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **1997 (70th)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"elles\"\n   - Original title: \"elles\"\n   - Languages: French and Portuguese\n   - Director: Lu\u00eds Galv\u00e3o Teles\n   - Result: Not nominated\n\n   The film here is \"elles,\" which doesn't match \"your name is justine.\" So, not relevant.\n\n2. **1998 (71st)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"back in trouble\"\n   - Original title: \"back in trouble\"\n   - Languages: Luxembourgish and German\n   - Director: Andy Bausch\n   - Result: Not nominated\n\n   Again, the film doesn't match \"your name is justine,\" and the languages are not French. So, no relevance.\n\n3. **2003 (76th)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"i always wanted to be a saint\"\n   - Original title: \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\"\n   - Languages: French\n   - Director: Genevi\u00e8ve Mersch\n   - Result: Not nominated\n\n   The film here is \"i always wanted to be a saint,\" which doesn't match the claim. However, it's in French, so if another row had this film and was in French, that might be relevant. But since it's a different film, not directly related.\n\n4. **2005 (78th)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"renart the fox\"\n   - Original title: \"le roman de renart\"\n   - Languages: French\n   - Director: Thierry Schiel\n   - Result: Not nominated\n\n   The film is \"renart the fox,\" not \"your name is justine.\" So, no match here either.\n\n5. **2006 (79th)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"your name is justine\"\n   - Original title: \"your name is justine\"\n   - Languages: Polish and English\n   - Director: Franco de Pena\n   - Result: Disqualified\n\n   Here, the film matches exactly as per the claim. However, the languages are listed as Polish and English, not French. This seems contradictory because the claim says it should be in French.\n\n6. **2007 (80th)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"little secrets\"\n   - Original title: \"perl oder pica\"\n   - Languages: Luxembourgish\n   - Director: Pol Cruchten\n   - Result: Not nominated\n\n   Doesn't match the film title or language, so not relevant.\n\n7. **2008 (81st)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"nuits d'arabie\"\n   - Original title: \"nuits d'arabie\"\n   - Languages: French and Arabic\n   - Director: Paul Kieffer\n   - Result: Not nominated\n\n   Doesn't match the film or language, so not relevant.\n\n8. **2009 (82nd)**\n   - Film used in nomination: \"refractaire\"\n   - Original title: \"r\u00e9fractaire\"\n   - Languages: French\n   - Director: Nicolas Steil\n   - Result: Not nominated\n\n   The film here is \"refractaire,\" which doesn't match the claim. So, not relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only row where the film used in nomination matches the title from the claim is the 2006 (79th) ceremony. However, there's a discrepancy because the languages listed for that film are Polish and English, whereas the claim specifies French. This suggests that the film was submitted in other languages but perhaps not in French.\n\nBut wait, the table lists the original title as \"your name is justine\" with languages including Polish and English. If the claim says it should be in French, then there's a mismatch. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because while the film exists and matches the title, its languages don't align with what the claim states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider if the original title was \"your name is justine\" but submitted in French. But according to the table, it's originally in Polish and English. So, maybe the claim is incorrect because the film wasn't submitted in French.\n\nBut wait, looking again: The table shows for 2006 (79th), the film used in nomination is \"your name is justine,\" with original title same, languages as Polish and English. So it was submitted under that title but not in French. Therefore, the claim's assertion that it should be in French might be incorrect.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because while the film exists, it wasn't submitted in French.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that \"your name is justine\" was submitted in French.

Scanning each row, I see:\n\n- 1997: Elles\n- 1998: Back In Trouble\n- 2003: I Always Wanted To Be A Saint\n- 2005: Renart The Fox\n- 2006: Your Name Is Justine\n- 2007: Little Secrets\n- 2008: Nuits D'Arabie\n- 2009: Refractaire\n\nYes, in the 2005 row, \"Renart The Fox\" is listed under \"film title used in nomination.\" So that's a relevant cell.\n\nNext, I need to check the original title for this entry. In the same row, the \"original title\" is \"Le Roman De Renart.\" Hmm, but the claim says the original title is \"perl oder pica.\" That doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in translation or looking up.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. The original title for 2005 is listed as \"le roman de renart,\" which translates to \"The Tale of Renart.\" Now, the claim says the original title is \"perl oder pica.\" That doesn't seem to match at all.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should look into the other possible titles or translations. Could \"perl oder pica\" be a variant? No, from what I know, \"perl oder pica\" isn't associated with Renart; it's actually part of another story or possibly a different language version. So the original title in the table doesn't match the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to another film titled \"Renart The Fox\" but that's not listed here. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding which row corresponds. Let me check again: the 2005 row for Renart The Fox has an original title of \"le roman de renart,\" so that doesn't match \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nWait, could there be a mistake in the table? No, according to the table provided, \"Renart The Fox\" is listed under \"film title used in nomination,\" and its original title is \"le roman de renart.\" Therefore, the claim that Renart The Fox has an original title of \"perl oder pica\" is incorrect. \n\nSo, to sum up: The claim's film title matches the \"film title used in nomination\" column for 2005, but the original title does not match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check both the film title and its original title against the table.\n\n1. **Film Title Check**: The claim mentions \"renart the fox,\" which matches the \"film title used in nomination\" for the 2005 row.\n2. **Original Title Check**: The original title listed is \"le roman de renart,\" not \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nSince the original title doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the original title for refractaire be back in trouble.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about two specific things: the original title and the film title used in nomination. The original title should be \"back in trouble\" for \"refractaire,\" but I need to check the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different year of the ceremony. I'm looking for the row where the film's original title is \"refractaire.\" Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from 1997: The film titles are \"elles,\" which doesn't match. Then in 2003: \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\" \u2013 not relevant. 2005: \"le roman de renart\" \u2013 nope. 2006: \"your name is justine.\" Not matching either.\n\nNow, looking for the original title \"refractaire,\" which I believe is in row 2009 (82nd). In that row, the film's original title is listed as \"r\u00e9fractaire,\" and the film used in nomination is \"refractaire.\" So the original title is correct.\n\nWait, but the claim says the original title for \"refractaire\" should be \"back in trouble.\" However, according to the table, the original title is \"r\u00e9fractaire,\" not \"back in trouble.\" The film title used in nomination in 2009 is indeed \"refractaire,\" but that's separate from the original title.\n\nSo the claim seems to mix up two columns: original title and film title. It's correct that the film used in nomination is \"refractaire,\" but the original title is \"r\u00e9fractaire,\" not \"back in trouble.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the original title with \"back in trouble\" when it's actually \"r\u00e9fractaire.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"original title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
