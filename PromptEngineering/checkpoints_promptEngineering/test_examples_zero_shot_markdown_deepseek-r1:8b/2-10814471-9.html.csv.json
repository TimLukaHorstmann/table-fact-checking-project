    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 points on 25 tries\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table provided.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: It states that Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points with 25 tries. So I need to find the relevant row for Tevita Vaikona in the table and check the values under 'goals' and 'tries'.\n\nLooking through the table, I see several players, including Tevita Vaikona. His name is listed in the 'player' column, so I'll locate his row. Scanning each row:\n\n1. Robbie Paul - Fullback\n2. Tevita Vaikona - Wing\n3. Leon Pryce - Centre\n4. Nathan McAvoy - Centre\n5. Michael Withers - Fullback\n6. Henry Paul - Stand off\n7. Paul Deacon - Scrum half\n8. Joe Vagana - Prop\n9. James Lowes - Hooker\n10. Paul Anderson - Prop\n11. Daniel Gartner - Second row\n12. Mike Forshaw - Loose forward\n13. Lee Gilmour - Second row\n14. Shane Rigon - Centre\n15. Alex Wilkinson - Wing\n16. Lee Radford - Prop\n17. Jamie Peacock - Second row\n18. Scott Naylor - Centre\n19. Brian Mc Dermott - Prop\n20. Graham Mackay - Wing\n21. Paul Sykes - Centre\n22. Rob Parker - Prop\n23. Stuart Spruce - Fullback\n24. Stuart Fielden - Prop\n\nI found Tevita Vaikona in row 2, with the position 'Wing'. Now I need to check the 'tries' and 'goals' columns for this player.\n\nLooking at his row (row index 1 if starting from 0), under 'tries', it's 25. That matches the number of tries mentioned in the claim. Next, checking 'goals': it shows 0. The claim states he scored 100 points, but according to the table, his goals are 0 and his points are 100.\n\nWait a minute, that's inconsistent. If his goals are 0, how did he score 100 points? In rugby, typically, points come from tries (5 points each), goals after tries (2 points), field goals (3 points), and conversions (1 point). But in the table, 'goals' might refer to conversion attempts or successful goal kicks. If Tevita made 0 goals, then his total points should be based on other sources like tries.\n\nBut according to the table, his points are listed as 100 with 25 tries. So if each try is worth 5 points, 25 tries would give him 125 points, but that doesn't add up to 100. Alternatively, maybe in this table, points are calculated differently or there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, looking again: the 'goals' column for Tevita Vaikona is 0, and his points are 100. So if he has 25 tries (each worth 5) that would be 125 points, but the table says 100. This discrepancy suggests either a mistake in the table or perhaps the way points are calculated here.\n\nHowever, regardless of how points are calculated, the claim specifically states that he scored 100 points on 25 tries. So, looking at the 'tries' column: it's 25, which matches. But his goals are 0, so if points are derived from tries plus other factors (like goals after tries), but in this table, it seems like goals and points are separate columns.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. The 'goals' might not refer to points scored but rather attempts or successful conversions. So Tevita made 0 goals, which could mean he didn't convert any tries into extra points. Therefore, his total points would be based solely on tries: 25 *5 =125, but the table says 100. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this context, 'goals' refers to something else, like penalty kicks or drop goals, which are worth different points. But without more information, it's hard to say. However, according to the table, Tevita has 25 tries and 0 goals, resulting in 100 points. That suggests that each try is not worth 5 points here.\n\nBut regardless of the point system, the claim states he scored 100 points on 25 tries. Looking at his 'points' column: it's indeed 100, and 'tries' are 25. So even if there's a discrepancy in how the points are calculated, the numbers given in the claim match the table.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are his 'tries' (25) and 'points' (100). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries,\" I checked Tevita Vaikona's row in the table. His 'tries' column has 25 attempts, matching the claim, and his 'points' are listed as 100. Although there's a discrepancy in how points might be calculated (since 25 tries should yield more than 100 if each try is worth 5 points), the numbers provided in the claim align with the table. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on the data given.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim about Tevita Vaikona is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Tevita Vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries.\" So, I should check two things: if Tevita has scored at least 100 points and whether he made more than 23 tries.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find Tevita Vaikona. Scanning through the 'player' column... Ah, there he is. His position is wing, and his goals are 0? Wait, no, wait. The table shows goals as 0 for him. Hmm, but points are 100.\n\nWait, points might include other aspects like tries or maybe other stats. But in this case, the columns are tries, goals, and points. So Tevita has 25 tries, which is more than 23, and he scored 0 goals, but his total points are 100. That means he's scoring 100 points with 0 goals? That seems odd because typically points come from tries or goals.\n\nWait, maybe in this context, points include both tries (which are worth 5 points each) and goals (which might be 3 points each). But the 'goals' column is separate. So Tevita's goals are 0, but his points are 100. That would mean he must have made a lot of tries because 25 tries times 4? Wait, no, 25 tries at 5 points each would be 125 points. But his total points are 100, so that doesn't add up unless there's something else.\n\nWait, maybe the 'points' column includes other factors like conversions or penalties, but in this table, I don't see any other categories except tries, goals, and points. So Tevita has 25 tries (which would be 125 points) plus 0 goals, but his total is 100 points. That doesn't make sense unless the points are calculated differently, like maybe not all tries count as 5 points or something else. But I can't assume that because I don't have the rules.\n\nBut putting aside how Tevita got 100 points, the claim says he scored at least 100 points with more than 23 tries. So regardless of how, his points are 100 and tries are 25, which is more than 23. Now, we need to check if any other players meet this condition: scoring at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries.\n\nSo I'll go through each player:\n\n1. Robbie Paul: 23 tries, 0 goals, 92 points \u2192 Doesn't have >23 tries.\n2. Tevita Vaikona: 25 tries, 0 goals, 100 points \u2192 Meets condition.\n3. Leon Pryce: 16 tries, 0 goals, 64 points \u2192 Doesn't meet.\n4. Nathan McAvoy: 4 tries, 0 goals, 16 points \u2192 No.\n5. Michael Withers: 31 tries, 0 goals, 124 points \u2192 He has more than 23 tries and 124 points. So that's another player who meets the condition.\n6. Henry Paul: 9 tries, 208 goals, 457 points \u2192 But he only has 9 tries, which is less than 23.\n7. Paul Deacon: 6 tries, 29 goals, 86 points \u2192 Doesn't meet.\n8. Joe Vagana: 2 tries, 0 goals, 8 points \u2192 No.\n9. James Lowes: 13 tries, 0 goals, 53 points \u2192 No.\n10. Paul Anderson: 8 tries, 0 goals, 32 points \u2192 No.\n11. Daniel Gartner: 14 tries, 0 goals, 56 points \u2192 No.\n12. Mike Forshaw: 6 tries, 0 goals, 24 points \u2192 No.\n13. Lee Gilmour: 8 tries, 0 goals, 32 points \u2192 No.\n14. Shane Rigon: 12 tries, 0 goals, 48 points \u2192 No.\n15. Alex Wilkinson: 0 tries, 0 goals, 0 points \u2192 No.\n16. Lee Radford: 2 tries, 0 goals, 8 points \u2192 No.\n17. Jamie Peacock: 8 tries, 0 goals, 32 points \u2192 No.\n18. Scott Naylor: 14 tries, 0 goals, 56 points \u2192 No.\n19. Brian Mc Dermott: 3 tries, 0 goals, 12 points \u2192 No.\n20. Graham Mackay: 12 tries, 1 goal, 50 points \u2192 12 tries is less than 23.\n21. Paul Sykes: 0 tries, 0 goals, 0 points \u2192 No.\n22. Rob Parker: 0 tries, 0 goals, 0 points \u2192 No.\n23. Stuart Spruce: 6 tries, 0 goals, 24 points \u2192 No.\n24. Stuart Fielden: 3 tries, 0 goals, 12 points \u2192 No.\n\nSo the only player who has more than 23 tries and at least 100 points is Tevita Vaikona. But wait, Michael Withers has 31 tries and 124 points, which also meets the condition. Therefore, Tevita isn't the only one; Michael also does. So the claim says Tevita is the only one, but he's not. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tevita Vaikona is the sole player with at least 100 points and more than 23 tries. However, Michael Withers also meets these criteria, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
