    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"Bruno Brand\u00e3o from Brazil have a snatch of 157.0.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate Bruno Brand\u00e3o in the table. Looking at the 'name' column, I see that Bruno Brand\u00e3o (Bra) is row index 3. \n\nNext, I need to check the 'snatch' column for this individual. In row 3, under 'snatch', the value is 157.0 kg.\n\nSince the claim directly states that Bruno Brand\u00e3o's snatch is 157.0 and the table confirms this, the claim is supported. Therefore, it should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is confirmed by the data in the table as Bruno Brand\u00e3o has a snatch of 157.0 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be only 1 person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight be 104.70.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse what each part means. The claim has two main conditions:\n\n1. There is exactly one person whose snatch weight is 153.0 kg.\n2. That same person's bodyweight is 104.70 kg.\n\nSo, I need to check the table for any individuals meeting both these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a person with their details: name, bodyweight, snatch, clean & jerk, and total weight. \n\nI'll start by identifying all people with a snatch of exactly 153.0 kg. Let's scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Snatch is 175.0 \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 1: Snatch is 160.0 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: Snatch is 150.0 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 3: Snatch is 157.0 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 4: Snatch is 153.0 kg. That's one person.\n- Row 5: Snatch is 140.0 \u2013 not matching.\n- Rows 6 to 9 have either '-' or different values, so not relevant.\n\nWait, row 4 is Christian L\u00f3pez from Guatemala with a snatch of 153.0 kg. So that's one person who meets the first condition.\n\nNow, let's check his bodyweight. According to the table, Christian L\u00f3pez has a bodyweight of 104.7 kg. The claim specifies 104.70 kg, which matches exactly when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nSo both conditions are satisfied by this individual. Therefore, there is exactly one person who meets both criteria.\n\nI don't see any other person with a snatch of 153.0 kg in the table. All others either have different snatch weights or the data isn't applicable (like '-', dsq, dnf). So no one else qualifies.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because there is indeed only one person meeting both conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the person with the snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0 be ijose espinoza ( nca ) with total bodyweight greater than 100 kg.\"\n\nSo, I need to check each part of this statement against the table. The table has several columns: name, bodyweight, snatch, clean & jerk, and total (kg). Each row represents a different person with their respective data.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: \"the person with the snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0.\" I should look for someone who has both these values in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Snatch is 175.0, Clean & Jerk is 205.0.\n- Row 1: Snatch is 160.0, Clean & Yerks 180.0.\n- Row 2: Snatch 150.0, Clean & Yerks 188.0.\n- Row 3: Snatch 157.0, Clean & Yerks 180.0.\n- Row 4: Snatch 153.0, Clean & Yerks 182.0.\n- Row 5: Snatch 140.0, Clean & Yerks 176.0.\n- Rows 6 and onwards have either \"-\", \"dnf\", or \"dsq\".\n\nSo the person with Snatch 153.0 is in row 4, Christian L\u00f3pez (Gua), and he has a Clean & Jerk of 182.0. Wait, but the claim says Clean & Yerks 180.0. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, looking for someone who has both 153.0 snatch and 180.0 clean & jerk.\n\nLooking again: Row 1 has Snatch 160.0, Clean & Jerk 180.0. That's Pedro Stetsiuk (Arg). But his Snatch is not 153.0.\n\nRow 3: Bruno Brand\u00e3o (Bra) has Snatch 157.0 and Clean & Yerks 180.0. Not matching both the values mentioned.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim says \"snatch 153.0\" and \"clean & jerk of 180.0\". So looking for someone who has exactly those numbers. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 4: Snatch is 153.0, Clean & Yerks 182.0. Doesn't match.\n\nIs there anyone else? Looking back, I don't see another person with both 153.0 and 180.0. So perhaps the claim is referring to Christian L\u00f3pez (row 4), but his Clean & Yerks are higher than 180.0. Alternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because the person doesn't have those numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the person with the snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0 be ijose espinoza (nca)\". So it's asserting that Jos\u00e9 Espinoza has those values.\n\nLooking at row 7: Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (NCA). His Snatch is \"-\", which probably means no data or not recorded, and his Clean & Yerks are also \"-\". So he doesn't have the values mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo the first part of the claim is incorrect because the person they're referring to (Jos\u00e9) doesn't have those numbers. Alternatively, maybe the claim refers to someone else, but it specifically names Jos\u00e9.\n\nNow, moving on. The second part: \"be ijose espinoza (nca )\". So the claim is stating that this person (Jos\u00e9) has a total bodyweight greater than 100 kg.\n\nLooking at row 7 for Jos\u00e9's bodyweight: It's 99.4 kg, which is less than 100 kg. Therefore, his bodyweight isn't greater than 100 kg as claimed.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim says that Jos\u00e9 has a snatch of 153.0 and Clean & Yerks of 180.0, but he doesn't have those numbers. Also, his bodyweight is below 100 kg, so even if he did have those lifts, the total wouldn't meet the bodyweight criteria.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Jos\u00e9 doesn't have the specified lifts and his bodyweight isn't over 100 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the person named Jos\u00e9 Espinoza does not have a snatch of 153.0 kg or a clean & jerk of 180.0 kg as stated, and his total bodyweight is less than 100 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
