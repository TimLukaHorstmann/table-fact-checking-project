    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says: \"the game on march 8 be play by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor).\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's about a specific game on March 8th where Minnesota is the home team and Philadelphia is the visitor. So, I need to check if in the table, on March 8th, the home team is Minnesota and the visitor is Philadelphia.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different date. The dates are march 1 through march 30. I'll need to find the row for March 8. \n\nLet me scan down the 'date' column until I find March 8. Here it is: \n\n| march 8  | philadelphia | 6 - 2   | minnesota    | peeters    |        15701 | 43 - 7 - 15  |\n\nSo, the visitor for this game is Philadelphia and the home team is Minnesota. That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The 'date' cell is definitely relevant because it confirms the date of the game. The 'home' and 'visitor' cells also confirm that Minnesota is home and Philadelphia is visitor.\n\nWait, should I include all three columns? Or just the ones that directly support the claim? The claim mentions both the teams (home and visitor), so those two columns are key. Plus, the date is important to locate the correct row.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. date: March 8\n2. home: Minnesota\n3. visitor: Philadelphia\n\nI think that's all. Each of these pieces of information directly supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"edmonton be a visitor on march 9 to philadelphia , with a record of 44 - 7 - 15\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts. The first part is about Edmonton being a visitor on March 9 against Philadelphia, and the second part is about their record being 44-7-15.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to March 9. Scanning through the 'date' column: march 1, march 2, march 4, march 6, march 8, march 9. So, row index is 6 for March 9.\n\nIn that row, under the 'visitor' column, I see \"edmonton\". That matches the first part of the claim. So Edmonton was indeed the visitor on March 9 against Philadelphia.\n\nNext, checking the 'record' column for March 9. The record listed is 44-7-15. The claim also states this exact number, so that part checks out too.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the table to make sure I didn't miss anything. For March 9, the date is correct, and Edmonton is the visitor as per the table. The attendance number might not be necessary for this specific claim since it's about the team's record and visitor status, not the attendance.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are met: Edmonton was the visitor on March 9 against Philadelphia with a record of 44-7-15.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table. Edmonton was indeed the visitor on March 9 against Philadelphia, and their record was 44-7-15.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"quebec have a decision of myre , and a record of 44 - 7 - 15.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: the decision and the record.\n\nStarting with the decision part: \"decision of myre.\" Looking at the table, each row has a \"visitor\" and a \"decision\" column. The visitor's name is usually the team that visited, but sometimes it might be the home team. Wait, no\u2014 in hockey, when a team visits another city, they are the away team. So the home team is listed as the opponent. So for each row, the visitor is the away team.\n\nI need to find a row where the decision is made by \"myre\" and the visitor is \"quebec.\" So I'll look through each row:\n\n1. March 1: Visitor philadelphia, decision myre\n2. March 2: Visitor montreal, decision peeters\n3. March 4: Visitor colorado, decision peeters\n4. March 6: Visitor ny islanders, decision myre\n5. March 8: Visitor minnesota, decision peeters\n6. March 9: Visitor edmonton, decision myre\n7. March 11: Visitor pittsburgh, decision peeters\n8. March 12: Visitor chicago, decision myre\n9. March 15: Visitor atlanta, decision peeters\n10. March 16: Visitor colorado, decision myre\n11. March 20: Visitor toronto, decision peeters\n12. March 21: Visitor hartford, decision myre\n13. March 23: Visitor boston, decision peeters\n14. March 25: Visitor ny islanders, decision myre\n15. March 27: Visitor quebec, decision peeters\n16. March 29: Visitor washington, decision myre\n17. March 30: Visitor atlanta, decision peeters\n\nLooking through these, I see that on March 27, the visitor is \"quebec.\" The decision for that row is \"peeters,\" not \"myre.\" So there's no row where the visitor is quebec and the decision is myre. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nNow, checking the record part: \"record of 44 - 7 - 15.\" I need to find if quebec has this record. The table has a column called \"record,\" which seems to be the team's overall record before or after the game? Looking at the data:\n\nLooking through each row's attendance, the record changes each time there's a home game. For example, after March 1, philadelphia's record is 41-5-15. Then on March 2, montreal has 41-6-15, and so on.\n\nI need to find the team \"quebec\" in the table. Wait, looking through the visitor list: I see quebec only once, as the visitor on March 27. Their record is shown as 46 - 11 - 18 in that row. That doesn't match 44-7-15.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"record\" refers to something else, but in the context of sports, it's likely their overall wins-losses-ties record. So quebec has a record of 46-11-18 as per March 27. That doesn't match 44-7-15.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe \"record\" is for the home team? Let me check that. For example, on March 1, philadelphia is home and their record is 41-5-15 after the game. On March 27, quebec is the visitor, so the home team would be philadelphia. So the home team's record on that day was updated to 46-11-18.\n\nSo if the claim says quebec has a record of 44-7-15, but looking at their game on March 27, they had a different record before and after. Wait, no\u2014 actually, each row shows the state after the game. So in March 27, quebec as visitor, so the home team is philadelphia. The attendance for that game was 17077. The record after the game is 46-11-18.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me look again: Each row has \"record\" as a column. So each game's result affects both teams' records? Or does it only affect the home team?\n\nIn sports, usually, when a team plays away, their record is updated based on the outcome, same with the home team. But in the table, after each game, the home team's record is shown, and sometimes the visitor's record changes as well.\n\nWait, looking at March 1: philadelphia (home) has a score of 3-3, and their record becomes 41-5-15. The next day, montreal (visitor) has a record of 41-6-15, which suggests that when they lost, their own record was updated. So each game affects both teams' records. Therefore, the \"record\" column shows the team's overall performance after the game.\n\nSo for quebec, on March 27, they visited philadelphia and had a score of 2-5. After this game, quebec's record is shown as 46-11-18. So that doesn't match 44-7-15 at all.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The visitor on March 27 was quebec with a decision by peeters and a record of 46-11-18. There's no instance where quebec had a decision made by myre or had that specific record.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the \"record\" as being only for one team. Let me check another example: On March 1, philadelphia (home) has a record of 41-5-15 after the game. The visitor, philadelphia? No, wait, the first row says Visitor is philadelphia. Wait no, that can't be\u2014 if they are the home team, their opponent would be listed as visitor.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the home and visitor in the table. Let me re-examine: Each row lists the game between two teams, with one being home and the other away (visitor). The \"record\" column shows the result after that game for each team?\n\nBut in the table, it's only showing one record per row\u2014 maybe it's just updating one team's record. Alternatively, perhaps the record is specific to the home team.\n\nWait, on March 1: Home team is philadelphia, score 3-3, and their record becomes 41-5-15. The visitor was someone else (I think in this context, each row represents a game between two teams, with one as home and one as away). So maybe the \"record\" column only reflects the home team's record after that game.\n\nIn that case, the claim says quebec has a record of 44-7-15. Looking through all rows where the visitor is quebec (only March 27), the home team's record would have been updated to 46-11-18. So that doesn't match either.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The visitor was quebec on March 27 with a decision by peeters and home team record as 46-11-18. There is no instance where quebec's record is 44-7-15 or they have a decision by myre.\n</think>\n\nThe claim contains two inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Decision Maker**: On March 27, when quebec visited philadelphia, the decision was made by peeters, not myre.\n\n2. **Record**: After the game on March 27, quebec's record was updated to 46-11-18, not 44-7-15.\n\nBoth statements in the claim are false based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is incorrect. On March 27, when quebec visited philadelphia, the decision was made by peeters, and quebec's record after that game was 46-11-18, not 44-7-15.",
