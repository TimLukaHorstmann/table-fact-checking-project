    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"1990 - 01 - 28 be the kickoff date for the round of r4.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with several columns: round, kick off, opponents, h/a, result, attendance, and report. Each row corresponds to a different match or replay.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the kick off date for round r4 being 1990-01-28. So I need to find in the table which row corresponds to r4 and check if its kick off date matches this.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (r3) has a kick off on 1990-01-06 against Swansea City.\n- Next is r3 replay on 1990-01-09, same opponents.\n- Then comes r4 on 1990-01-28 vs Norwich City. That's the row I'm interested in because it's round r4.\n\nThe kick off date for r4 is indeed 1990-01-28, which matches the claim exactly. So the claim should be TRUE. \n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: the column is \"kick off\" and the row index is where the round is r4. In the table, r4 is the third row (since it's after r3 and r3 replay). Wait, let me check again. The first row is r3, second r3 replay, then r4 is the fourth entry? Or does \"r4\" start at index 3?\n\nYes, in the markdown table, the rows are:\n\n1. r3\n2. r3 replay\n3. r4\n4. r4 replay\n5. r5\n6. r6\n7. r6 replay\n8. sf\n\nSo r4 is at row index 3 (since we start counting from 0, but the user probably considers them as 1st row, 2nd, etc.). Wait no, in programming terms, it's zero-indexed, but in the table, the first row is header, then data rows. Let me clarify: the header is row 0, and then each match starts at row 1 onwards.\n\nWait, looking back, the markdown shows:\n\n| round     | kick off       | opponents           | h / a   | result        |   attendance | report   |\n|:----------|:---------------|:--------------------|:--------|:--------------|-------------:|:---------|\n| r3        | 1990 - 01 - 06 | swansea city        | a       | 0 - 0         |        16098 | mr       |\n| r3 replay | 1990 - 01 - 09 | swansea city        | h       | 8 - 0         |        29194 | mr       |\n| r4        | 1990 - 01 - 28 | norwich city        | a       | 0 - 0         |        23152 | mr       |\n... and so on.\n\nSo the first data row is row index 1 (since header is row 0). Wait, in markdown tables, typically the header is row 0, then each subsequent row is an entry. So r3 is row 1, r3 replay row 2, r4 row 3, etc.\n\nWait no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: when using markdown tables, the first line is the header separator (the |:----------:) and then the header columns, which are considered as the first data row in some contexts, but perhaps not. In reality, the actual data starts from the next line.\n\nIn this case, the table has a header row with \"round\", etc., followed by the data rows starting from r3, r3 replay, etc. So each of these is a separate row, and their indices would be 1,2,3,... up to 8.\n\nWait no, perhaps the first line after the separator is the first row, which is r3 at index 0? Or does the header count as row 0?\n\nThis is confusing because in programming terms, sometimes the header isn't counted as a data row. But for this task, I think we should consider each row starting from the header as row 0. So:\n\nRow 0: Header\nRow 1: r3\nRow 2: r3 replay\nRow 3: r4\n... and so on.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is in row 3 (r4's kick off date). The column name for that data point is \"kick off\".\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be a list containing an object with row_index=3 and column_name=\"kick off\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if the round r4 has its kick off on 1990-01-28. From the table, r4's kick off date matches this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the 1990 - 01 - 28 kick off date have a round value of r4\". \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant to verifying this claim. Let me look at the table columns: round, kick off, opponents, h/a, result, attendance, report.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"kick off\" date of 1990 - 01 - 28 and specifies that the round value is r4. So I need to find in the table the row where the kick off date matches 1990-01-28.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 3: r4, 1990 - 01 - 28, norwich city, a, 0 - 0, attendance 23152, mr\n\nSo row index is 3 (if we start counting from 0). The round value here is indeed r4. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the row with index 3 and the \"round\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I identified the row where the kick-off date is 1990-01-28 and checked the corresponding round value.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the claim:** The claim states that on January 28, 1990 (kick-off date), the round was r4.\n2. **Search the table:** Find the row with the kick-off date 1990-01-28.\n3. **Check the \"round\" column:** In that row, the round is listed as r4.\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the result of round r6 replay with h / a of h be 1 - 0.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It's talking about a specific round (r6 replay) and a specific metric, which is the result when playing at home (h) or away (a). The result is given as 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match in various rounds. The columns include round type (like r3, r3 replay, etc.), kick off date, opponents, whether it was a home or away game (h/a), the result, attendance, and the report number.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that correspond to the claim. So, I'll look for the row where the round is r6 replay. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first few rows are r3, r3 replay, r4, r4 replay, r5, r6, and then r6 replay.\n- So, the r6 replay row is the 7th one in the table.\n\nIn that row, the columns are: round (r6 replay), kick off date (1990 - 03 - 14), opponents (queens park rangers), h/a (h), result (1 - 0), attendance (38090), and report (mr).\n\nNow, checking each column in this row:\n\n- The \"round\" is r6 replay, which matches the claim.\n- \"Opponents\" are queens park rangers, but that's not needed here.\n- \"h/a\" is h, as specified in the claim.\n- \"Result\" is 1 - 0, which exactly matches the claim.\n\nSo, all these cells for the r6 replay row seem to support the claim. The only other columns are attendance and report, but they don't relate to the result directly. Therefore, the relevant cells are round (r6 replay), h/a (h), and result (1 - 0).\n\nI should make sure that all parts of the claim are covered by these cells. Since the claim specifies the round type and the h/a status and the exact score, all conditions are met in this row.\n\nSo, putting it together, the answer is TRUE because each relevant cell matches what's stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"h / a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"1990 - 01 - 29 be the kickoff date for the round value of r4.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each column in the table represents. The columns are round (r3, r3 replay, r4, etc.), kick off, opponents, h/a (home or away), result, attendance, and report. So, each row corresponds to a specific match in some competition, probably football given the context.\n\nThe claim is about the date of the kickoff for round r4. So I need to find in the table which row corresponds to r4 and check if its kick off date matches 1990-01-29.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first column is 'round', with entries like r3, r3 replay, r4, etc.\n2. The second column is 'kick off', which lists dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\n3. So I need to find the row where the round is r4 and see if its kick off date is 1990-01-29.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- r3: kick off on 1990-01-06\n- r3 replay: kick off on 1990-01-09\n- r4: kick off on 1990-01-28\n- r4 replay: kick off on 1990-01-31\n- r5: kick off on 1990-02-17\n- r6: kick off on 1990-03-11\n- r6 replay: kick off on 1990-03-14\n- sf: kick off on 1990-04-08\n\nWait, so the r4 match is on 1990-01-28, not 1990-01-29. The claim says it should be 1990-01-29. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the table again, row for r4 has kick off on 1990-01-28, which is a Saturday. The next day is 1990-01-29, which might be a reason why there's an replay. But the claim is specifically about the date of the round r4 match, not its replay.\n\nSo the claim is saying that r4's kick off was on 1990-01-29, but according to the table, it was actually on 1990-01-28. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the round r4's kick off date is 1990-01-29. Checking the table, round r4's kick off is listed as 1990-01-28, not 29. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"kick off\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
