    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim is: \"On July 14, 1979 at VFL Park, the away team Geelong scored 11.12 (78).\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Date**: July 14, 1979\n2. **Venue**: VFL Park\n3. **Away Team**: Geelong\n4. **Score**: 11.12 (78)\n\nNow, I'll refer to the table provided in markdown format.\n\nLooking at the table headers, there are several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a match between two teams with their respective scores.\n\nI need to find the specific row where:\n\n- The **venue** is VFL Park.\n- The **date** is July 14, 1979.\n- The **away team** is Geelong, and their score is 11.12 (78).\n\nLet me scan through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Venue is mcg, Date is 14 july 1979. Away team is south melbourne with a score of 24.10 (154). Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 1**: Venue is western oval, Date is 14 july 1979. Away team is st kilda with a score of 11.15 (81). Doesn't match.\n3. **Row 2**: Venue is victoria park, Date is 14 july 1979. Away team is north melbourne with a score of 20.13 (133). Not Geelong.\n4. **Row 3**: Venue is princes park, Date is 14 july 1979. Away team is essendon with a score of 12.11 (83). No match.\n5. **Row 4**: Venue is vfl park, Date is 14 july 1979. Away team is geelong with a score of 11.13 (79). Close, but the score doesn't match 11.12 (78).\n6. **Row 5**: Venue is scg, Date is 15 july 1979. Away team is fitzroy with a score of 20.15 (135). Doesn't apply because the date is different.\n\nWait, in Row 4, the venue is VFL Park and the date is July 14, but the away team Geelong scored 11.13 (79), which doesn't match the claim's 11.12 (78).\n\nSo, there's no exact match for the claim in the table. The closest match is Row 4, where Geelong scored 11.13 (79) on July 14 at VFL Park. Since the score doesn't match exactly, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not match any row exactly in the table, as the away team Geelong's score is different from what's stated. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"Richmond's play against the away team Geelong to a crowd of 20777 at the western oval on July 14 1979.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if Richmond is the home team in any game where they played against Geelong with those specific details.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe first column is \"home team,\" the fourth is \"away team,\" the fifth is \"venue,\" the sixth is \"crowd,\" and the last is \"date.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to see if Richmond is the home team, Geelong is the away team, the crowd number matches 20777, and the date is July 14, 1979.\n\nStarting with the first row: Home team is Melbourne, so not relevant. Second row: Footscray vs St Kilda\u2014no match here. Third row: Collingwood vs North Melbourne. Fourth row: Carlton vs Essendon. Fifth row: Hawthorn vs Geelong\u2014I see Geelong as away, but the home team is Hawthorn, not Richmond.\n\nSixth row: Richmond is the home team, and the away team is Fitzroy. That's a different match than Geelong. So I don't see a row where Richmond plays against Geelong with those crowd numbers and date.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. Looking through each row:\n\n- The fifth row: Hawthorn vs Geelong at VFL Park, crowd 20777 on July 14, 1979.\n- No other rows have Geelong as the away team except this one, where Richmond isn't involved.\n\nSo, there's no game in the table where Richmond plays against Geelong with those specific details. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE because the information provided doesn't match any actual game in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
