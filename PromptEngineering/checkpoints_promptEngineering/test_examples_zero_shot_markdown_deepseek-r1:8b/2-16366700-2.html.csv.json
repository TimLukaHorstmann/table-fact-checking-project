    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine if a specific claim about Bobby Hull is true based on the given table. The claim is: \"Bobby Hull has scored the most playoff goal of all Chicago Blackhawks player.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being claimed. It's saying that Bobby Hull has the highest number of playoff goals compared to other Blackhawks players listed in the table. So, I should look at the 'playoff' column for each row and see how Bobby's value stacks up.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple players with their playoff goal counts. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62\n2. Stan Mikita: 59\n3. Steve Larmer: 45\n4. Denis Savard: 61\n5. Dennis Hull: 33\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 35\n7. Tony Amonte: 13\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n9. Bill Mosienko: 10\n10. Ken Wharram: 16\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum value in the 'playoff' column from these numbers. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with Bobby Hull at 62. Next is Stan Mikita with 59, which is less. Steve Larmer has 45, also lower. Denis Savard has 61, which is close but still less than 62. The rest are even lower. So, Bobby's 62 seems to be the highest among all listed players.\n\nWait, I should double-check if there are any other higher numbers that I might have missed. Scanning through again: 62,59,45,61,33,35,13,26,10,16. No, Bobby's 62 is indeed the highest.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim seems to be true because Bobby Hull has the highest playoff goals compared to all the other players listed.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Bill Mosienko having the fewest number of postseason goals is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Bill Mosienko has scored the fewest number of postseason goals compared to the other players listed in the table. So, my task is to check how many postseason goals each player has and see if Bill Mosienko indeed has the lowest count.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it includes columns for name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The \"playoffs\" column seems to be where the postseason goals are recorded because that's typically where playoff statistics would go. For example, Bobby Hull has 62 in the playoffs, Stan Mikita with 59, Steve Larmer with 45, Denis Savard with 61, Dennis Hull with 33, Jeremy Roenick with 35, Tony Amonte with 13, Hubert Pit Martin with 26, Bill Mosienko with 10, and Ken Wharram with 16.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that Bill Mosienko has 10 playoff goals. Let me list out all the playoff numbers to see where he stands:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nNow, to find the fewest number of playoff goals. The lowest among these is 10, which is Bill Mosienko's count. So yes, he does have the fewest.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if any other player has fewer than 10. Looking through the list again, all others are above 10 except for Tony Amonte who has 13 and Hubert Pit Martin with 26. No, so Bill Mosienko is indeed the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because Bill Mosienko does have the fewest postseason goals in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 398 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. I think it means that there's a difference of 398 goals between the player with the highest total and the one with the lowest total in their careers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The 'total' column seems to represent the sum of their regular season and playoff goals. So, I should focus on this 'total' column to check if any two players have a 398 goal difference.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the total goal numbers from the table:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum and minimum total goals from this list. The highest total is 666 by Bobby Hull. The lowest total is 268, shared by both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram.\n\nCalculating the difference between the highest (666) and the lowest (268): 666 - 268 = 398. So, that's exactly a 398 goal difference. Therefore, the claim is saying there is such a separation, which seems to be true based on this calculation.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if I didn't miss any other players with higher or lower totals. Let me go through each player again:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666 (highest)\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268 (lowest)\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nYes, Bobby is the highest at 666, and both Bill and Ken are tied for the lowest at 268. The difference is indeed 398.\n\nSo the claim is true because there is a separation of 398 goals between the highest scorer (Bobby Hull) and the lowest scorers (Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram). \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. Since the claim refers to the 'total' column, the relevant cells would be those where the total is either 666 or 268.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Bobby Hull's row has the highest total (666), so cell at row 0, column 'total'.\n- Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram both have the lowest total of 268. Their rows are 8 and 9 respectively, so cells at row 8 and 9, column 'total'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are these three.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"in the regular season, only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. Each row represents a player with their name, years active, regular season goals, playoff goals, and total goals. My main focus here is on the 'regular season' column because the claim is about that specifically.\n\nI need to check each player's regular season goals and see if exactly four of them scored more than 300 goals. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with Bobby Hull: His regular season goals are listed as 604, which is much higher than 300.\nNext, Stan Mikita has 541 regular season goals\u2014way above 300.\nSteve Larmer shows 406, also above 300.\nDenis Savard has 377 regular season goals, so that's over 300 too.\nDennis Hull with 298 regular season goals is just under 300, so he doesn't count.\nJeremy Roenick has 267, which is below 300.\nTony Amonte at 268 is also below 300.\nHubert Pit Martin's regular season goals are 243\u2014definitely below 300.\nBill Mosienko with 258 is still below 300.\nKen Wharram at 252 is just under 300 as well.\n\nNow, let me count how many players have more than 300 regular season goals. Bobby Hull (604), Stan Mikita (541), Steve Larmer (406), Denis Savard (377). That's four players. Dennis Hull is the only one just below 300, and the rest are under or at exactly 300.\n\nSo, the claim says \"only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals.\" Based on this count, that seems accurate. There are exactly four players with regular season goals over 300. \n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other players. Let me go through each name again:\n\n1. Bobby Hull - 604 (yes)\n2. Stan Mikita - 541 (yes)\n3. Steve Larmer - 406 (yes)\n4. Denis Savard - 377 (yes)\n5. Dennis Hull - 298 (no)\n6. Jeremy Roenick - 267 (no)\n7. Tony Amonte - 268 (no)\n8. Hubert Pit Martin - 243 (no)\n9. Bill Mosienko - 258 (no)\n10. Ken Wharram - 252 (no)\n\nYes, only four players meet the criteria. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that exactly four players have scored more than 300 goals in their regular season careers.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Bobby Hull having the least playoff goals among Chicago Blackhawks players is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this claim are \"playoffs\" and \"total,\" but actually, since the claim is about playoff goals, I think we need to focus on the \"regular season\" and \"playoffs\" columns, or maybe \"total\"? Wait, no, the claim is specifically about playoff goals. So, the key metric here would be the playoff column.\n\nWait, the table has a \"playoff\" column with values like 62 for Bobby Hull, 59 for Stan Mikita, etc. But in hockey, players have both regular season and playoff goals. The term \"score\" in the claim refers to playoff goals, so we need to compare Bobby Hull's playoff goals against others.\n\nSo, the first step is to identify all the players whose playoff data is available because if a player didn't make the playoffs, their playoff column might be blank or zero, but looking at the table, all the players have numbers in the \"playoffs\" column. So we can compare Bobby Hull's playoff goals with others.\n\nBobby Hull has 62 playoff goals. Let's list out the playoff goals for each player:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nLooking at these numbers, Bobby Hull has the highest number of playoff goals with 62. So if the claim is that he has the least, that's false because his playoff goals are actually higher than others.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any players or miscalculate. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62\n2. Stan Mikita: 59\n3. Steve Larmer: 45\n4. Denis Savard: 61\n5. Dennis Hull: 33\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 35\n7. Tony Amonte: 13\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n9. Bill Mosienko: 10\n10. Ken Wharram: 16\n\nYes, Bobby Hull has the highest at 62. Therefore, he does not have the least playoff goals; in fact, he's leading. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells part. The claim refers to \"playoff\" as that's where we're getting the numbers from. Each player's \"playoffs\" value is needed. So the relevant column is \"playoffs,\" and each row corresponds to a player, so all rows are relevant except maybe if the player didn't have any playoff goals, but in this table, everyone has at least 10 (Bill Mosienko) or more.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the players because we need to compare their playoff goals. Therefore, every row's \"playoffs\" column is relevant.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is only about Bobby Hull, so perhaps only his row is relevant? Or no, because it's comparing against others. The instruction says to determine if the claim is true or false by checking all conditions in the claim against the table. So the claim mentions \"all Chicago Blackhawks player,\" which implies a comparison across all players.\n\nTherefore, all players' playoff columns are relevant because we need to verify Bobby Hull's score against each of theirs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Bobby Hull has the least playoff goals among the listed players is FALSE. Upon reviewing the table, Bobby Hull actually has the highest number of playoff goals (62), which is more than any other player.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"there be only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" Hmm, let me try to understand this.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it lists several hockey players with their years, regular season goals, playoff goals, and total goals. I think the claim is talking about the difference in total goals between the top scorer and the bottom scorer being 20 or less, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the total goals themselves? Wait, no, the phrasing \"separate\" makes me think it's referring to the difference.\n\nSo I need to find out if the highest total goals minus the lowest total goals is only 20. Let me check each player's total goals:\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nNow, identify the highest and lowest totals. The highest is Bobby Hull with 666 goals. The lowest seems to be either Bill Mosienko or Ken Wharram, both at 268. Wait, no, looking back, Bill Mosienko is listed as 258 in regular season but total is 268, same as Ken Wharram. So the lowest total is 268.\n\nNow, the difference between Bobby Hull's 666 and the lowest (268) is 666 - 268 = 398. That's a big number, way more than 20. Therefore, the claim that only 20 goals separate them isn't true because it's actually over 300 goals apart.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"there be only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" So yes, if the difference is more than 20, then the claim is false. Since the difference is 398, which is much larger, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for this would be \"total\" because we're comparing total goals. So I have to find all the rows where the \"total\" column has values contributing to this comparison. That includes Bobby Hull's row (index 0) and Bill Mosienko or Ken Wharram's rows (indices 8 and 9). Wait, but in the table, Bill Mosienko is at index 8 and Ken Wharram is at index 9. So I need both their \"total\" cells.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- Bobby Hull: row 0, column \"total\"\n- Bill Mosienko: row 8, column \"total\"\n- Ken Wharram: row 9, column \"total\"\n\nWait, but in the table, rows are named as players, and each has a \"name,\" \"years,\" \"regular season,\" \"playoffs,\" and \"total.\" So for each of these players, their total goals are under the \"total\" column. Therefore, I need to include those cells.\n\nI think that's it. The answer is FALSE because the difference in total goals between Bobby Hull and the lowest scorer (either Bill Mosienko or Ken Wharram) is 398, which is not 20.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"no 2 player have score the same total number of goal.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here\u2014probably meant \"no two players have the same total number of goals.\" \n\nLet me look at the table again. It lists several hockey players with their names, years, regular season points, playoff points, and total points. My task is to check if any two players have the exact same total points.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row and note down the \"total\" column:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 666\n2. Stan Mikita: 600\n3. Steve Larmer: 451\n4. Denis Savard: 438\n5. Dennis Hull: 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 302\n7. Tony Amonte: 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n9. Bill Mosienko: 268\n10. Ken Wharram: 268\n\nLooking at these totals, I notice that Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram both have a total of 268 goals. That's the same number for two players. So this directly contradicts the claim because it says \"no two players have the same total.\" \n\nWait, are there any other duplicates? Let me double-check:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666 (unique)\n- Stan Mikita: 600 (unique)\n- Steve Larmer: 451 (unique)\n- Denis Savard: 438 (unique)\n- Dennis Hull: 331 (unique)\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302 (unique)\n- Tony Amonte: 281 (unique)\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269 (unique)\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nYes, only Bill and Ken share the same total. So this means that two players do have the same total number of goals, making the claim FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells part. The claim refers to \"no two player have score the same total number of goal,\" so I need to identify which cells are relevant. Since the key column here is \"total\", and specifically, rows where the total is duplicated.\n\nLooking at the table, Bill Mosienko is row index 8 (since it's zero-based), and Ken Wharram is row index 9. So their \"total\" column entries are both 268. Therefore, the relevant cells are for these two players in the \"total\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"in the regular season, all players have scored less than 300 goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each column in the table to see which ones are relevant. The table has these columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The claim is specifically about the regular season performance, so the relevant column here is \"regular season.\"\n\nNext, I'll go through each row one by one to check the values under the \"regular season\" column.\n\n1. **Bobby Hull**: 604 goals. That's way above 300.\n2. **Stan Mikita**: 541. Also well over 300.\n3. **Steve Larmer**: 406. Still more than 300.\n4. **Denis Savard**: 377. Again, higher than 300.\n5. **Dennis Hull**: 298. Hmm, that's just under 300? Wait, 298 is less than 300. That's interesting because the claim says \"less than 300,\" so maybe this one counts.\n6. **Jeremy Roenick**: 267. That's below 300.\n7. **Tony Amonte**: 268. Also below 300.\n8. **Hubert Pit Martin**: 243. Definitely below 300.\n9. **Bill Mosienko**: 258. Below 300.\n10. **Ken Wharram**: 252. Also below 300.\n\nWait, so most players have scores over 300 except for Dennis Hull and a few others who are just under or significantly lower. But the claim says \"all players\" have less than 300. Since Bobby Hull has 604, which is way above 300, that already contradicts the claim. So regardless of Dennis Hull's score, the fact that at least one player (Bobby Hull) scored more than 300 makes the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because not all players have scores less than 300 in the regular season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
