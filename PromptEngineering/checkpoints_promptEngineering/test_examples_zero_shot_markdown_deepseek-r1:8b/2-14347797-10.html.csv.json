    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: game, date, opponent, score, and series. Each row represents a specific game with details filled in those columns.\n\nThe claim mentions \"april 14\" specifically. So I need to find the row where the date is April 14.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 1: april 8\n- Game 2: april 10\n- Game 3: april 12\n- Game 4: april 14\n- Game 5: april 17\n\nSo Game 4 has the date april 14. Now, I check what the opponent is for that game. In the \"opponent\" column under Game 4, it says \"new jersey devils\".\n\nThe claim states that on April 14, the opponent was the New Jersey Devils. Since the table confirms this, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The date is in the \"date\" column at row_index 3 (since indexing starts at 0). So the two relevant cells are the \"game\" and \"opponent\" columns for that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
