    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about game 40 is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"game 40 have a high assist of eric gordon (6)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate game 40 in the table. Scanning through the 'game' column, I see game numbers from 32 up to 47. Game 40 is there on row index 9 (since it's zero-indexed as per the first row being 32). So, row_index is 9.\n\nNow, looking at the columns for this row. The claim mentions \"high assist\" and specifically \"eric gordon (6)\". So I need to check the 'high assists' column for game 40. \n\nLooking at game 40's data: under 'high assists', it says \"mardy collins (8)\". Wait, that doesn't match the claim which says eric gordon has a high assist of 6. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. The 'game' is 40, date is January 19. Team is Minnesota, and they lost with a score line. In the 'high assists' column for game 40, it's listed as mardy collins (8). So the high assist was from Mardy Collins, not Eric Gordon.\n\nTherefore, the claim that game 40 has a high assist of eric gordon (6) is incorrect. It should be FALSE because the actual high assist was from someone else.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
