    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"against south melbourne , the crowd size be 15736.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are the opponent (\"south melbourne\") and the crowd size (\"15736\"). So, I need to find in the table where the home team is playing against south melbourne and check if the crowd number matches 15736.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"crowd,\" and possibly others, but specifically \"crowd\" for this claim.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if there's a match where the away team is south melbourne and the crowd size is 15736.\n\nRow 0: Home team st kilda vs. away team south melbourne. The crowd number here is 15736. That matches, so this row is relevant.\n\nNow, I should check if any other rows might also have south melbourne as the away team with a crowd of 15736. But looking at the rest of the table:\n\nRows 1-5: The away teams are melbourne, north melbourne, footscray, collingwood, and richmond. None of these are south melbourne. So only Row 0 is relevant.\n\nTherefore, since there's a match against south melbourne with a crowd of 15736, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim is: \"carlton score 14.18 (102) in the home team game against north melbourne.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It mentions that Carlton scored 14.18 (102), and this was in a home game against North Melbourne. So, I need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll first find where Carlton is listed as the home team. Scanning down the 'home team' column: st kilda, essendon, carlton, geelong, fitzroy, hawthorn. So Carlton is in row 2 (since it's zero-indexed? Wait no, rows are numbered from 0 to 5, so Carlton is at index 2.\n\nNext, I'll look for the score of Carlton. The 'home team score' column has numbers like 11.21 (87), etc. For Carlton, the home team score is 14.18 (102). So that part matches.\n\nNow, checking who they played against. The 'away team' column: south melbourne, melbourne, north melbourne, footscray, collingwood, richmond. So in Carlton's row, the away team is North Melbourne. That matches the claim.\n\nNow, verifying all these cells: the home team score for Carlton is 14.18 (102), and they played against North Melbourne at home on April 19th, 1975. All these elements are present in the table. So each part of the claim corresponds correctly to the relevant cells in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"when the away team be south melbourne , the crowd be 22824\".\n\nFirst, I'll look at each step in detail.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that when the away team is South Melbourne, the crowd size is 22,824. So, I need to check if there's a row where the away team is South Melbourne and the crowd is 22824.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Rows**: I'll go through each row of the table to see which ones have \"south melbourne\" as the away team. From the table:\n\n   - Row 1: away team is south melbourne, crowd is 15736.\n   - Row 5: away team is collingwood, not relevant.\n\nWait, in the table provided by the user, let me recheck each row's \"away team\" and \"crowd\".\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- st kilda vs south melbourne: crowd 15736\n- essendon vs melbourne: 22824\n- carlton vs north melbourne:23824\n- geelong vs footscray:17158\n- fitzroy vs collingwood:17626\n- hawthorn vs richmond:39496\n\nSo, only the first row has \"south melbourne\" as the away team with a crowd of 15,736. There's no row where the away team is south melbourne and the crowd is 22,824.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**: Since the claim specifies that when the away team is south melbourne, the crowd should be 22824. The table shows that when the away team is south melbourne, the crowd is 15,736, which doesn't match 22,824.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there's no row where both conditions are met (south melbourne as away team and crowd of 22824), the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells would be those in the row where \"south melbourne\" is the away team to check the crowd. That's row index 0, columns \"away team\" and \"crowd\".\n\nSo, the JSON response should indicate that the answer is FALSE and include the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"north melbourne's away team score in the game at prince park be 9.12 (66)\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions three things: north melbourne as the away team, their score, and the venue where the game took place, which is prince park.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by scanning each row to see if any match these criteria. Each row has columns for home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is St Kilda, away team is South Melbourne. Venue is Moorabbin Oval. The scores are 11.21 (87) for St Kilda and 9.17 (71) for South Melbourne. Doesn't match north melbourne or prince park, so I can skip this row.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Home team is Essendon, away team is Melbourne. Venue is Windy Hill. Scores are 16.21 (117) and 15.10 (100). Not relevant here.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Home team is Carlton, away team is North Melbourne. Venue is Princes Park. Their scores are Carlton with 14.18 (102) and North Melbourne with 9.12 (66). Oh, wait! The away team here is North Melbourne, and their score is exactly what the claim mentions: 9.12 (66).\n\n4. **Row 3**: Home team is Geelong, away team is Footscray. Venue is Kardinia Park. Their scores don't match.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Home team is Fitzroy, away team is Collingwood. Venue is Junction Oval. No match here either.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Home team is Hawthorn, away team is Richmond. Venue is VFL Park. Again, not relevant.\n\nSo, in Row 2, the away team is North Melbourne with a score of 9.12 (66) at Princes Park. Wait, but the claim mentions \"prince park\". There's a discrepancy here: in the table, the venue is \"Princes Park\", while the claim says \"Prince Park\".\n\nI need to check if these are the same venues or not. Sometimes, similar names can be confusing. \"Princes\" vs. \"Prince\"\u2014they might be different venues or perhaps it's a typo. But looking at the table, I don't see any row with venue as \"Prince Park\". All have \"Princes Park\" except for Row 2, which is actually \"Princes Park\".\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"game at prince park\", but in the table, all relevant entries are at Princes Park. So perhaps it's a typo in the claim, or maybe they're referring to the same place.\n\nBut regardless of that, the main point is whether North Melbourne's away score was 9.12 (66). From Row 2, that's exactly what their away score was when they played Carlton at Princes Park. So that part matches.\n\nHowever, the venue in the table is \"Princes Park\", but the claim says \"Prince Park\". This could be an error in the claim, making it potentially incorrect because the venue doesn't match exactly. But maybe \"Princes\" and \"Prince\" are considered the same? I'm not sure. The exact wording matters here.\n\nSo, to satisfy the claim, two conditions must be met: the away team is North Melbourne with a score of 9.12 (66) and the venue is Prince Park. From the table, North Melbourne does have that score at Princes Park, but not at Prince Park. Therefore, the venue doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, looking back, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rows again. Row 2: home team Carlton, away team North Melbourne, score 9.12 (66), venue Princes Park. So the claim mentions \"prince park\", but in the table, it's \"Princes Park\". So that's different.\n\nSo, does this affect the truthfulness of the claim? If the claim specifies a venue that isn't in the table as exactly written, then it's incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because while the score and away team match, the venue doesn't exactly align with what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Prince Park\" and \"Princes Park\" are considered the same, maybe it's TRUE, but I think they are different venues. So, to be accurate, the claim is incorrect in mentioning the venue as Prince Park when it's actually Princes Park.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that North Melbourne's away score at Prince Park was 9.12 (66). From the table, North Melbourne played Carlton at Princes Park with a score of 9.12 (66). However, the venue is listed as Princes Park, not Prince Park. This discrepancy makes the claim incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully reading both the table and the claim.\n\nThe table has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows with different games on the same date, April 19th, 1975.\n\nThe claim says: \"the home team score be 14.18 (102) against the away team score of 14.14 (98).\" So I need to check if there's a row where the home team scored exactly 14.18 (102) and the away team scored 14.14 (98).\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is St Kilda with 11.21 (87), away team South Melbourne with 9.17 (71). Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 1**: Home team Essendon scored 16.21 (117), away Melbourne scored 15.10 (100). Not matching.\n3. **Row 2**: Carlton scored 14.18 (102), and the away team North Melbourne scored 9.12 (66). Wait, here the home team's score is exactly what the claim states: 14.18 (102). But what about the away team? The claim says the away team scored 14.14 (98). In this row, the away team scored only 9.12 (66), which doesn't match.\n4. **Row 3**: Geelong's score is 13.12 (90) against Footscray's 14.14 (98). Here, the home team's score isn't matching, and the away team's score is higher than what's claimed.\n5. **Row 4**: Fitzroy scored 12.13 (85), Collingwood scored 12.15 (87). Neither matches the claim.\n6. **Row 5**: Hawthorn scored 17.14 (116) against Richmond's 12.15 (87). Again, not matching.\n\nSo looking through each row, none of them have both the home team scoring exactly 14.18 (102) and the away team scoring 14.14 (98). The only row where the home team matches is Row 2, but the away team's score doesn't. Therefore, there's no row in the table that satisfies both conditions of the claim.\n\nI think the claim is making a statement about one specific game where these scores occurred together. Since such a game isn't present in the table, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the away team score be 9.12 (66) play against fitzroy\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what each part refers to. The claim mentions two specific scores and a match-up between an away team and a home team.\n\nThe first part of the claim is \"the away team score be 9.12 (66)\". This seems to refer to a particular score recorded by an away team in a game. Looking at the table, each row has entries for both the home and away teams, their respective scores, the venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nI'll need to check if there's an away team that scored 9.12 (66). To do this, I'll look through the \"away team score\" column in the table.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **st kilda vs south melbourne**: South Melbourne scored 9.17 (71).\n2. **essendon vs melbourne**: Melbourne scored 15.10 (100).\n3. **carlton vs north melbourne**: North Melbourne scored 9.12 (66). This matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n4. **geelong vs footscray**: Footscray scored 14.14 (98).\n5. **fitzroy vs collingwood**: Collingwood scored 12.15 (87).\n6. **hawthorn vs richmond**: Richmond scored 12.15 (87).\n\nWait, I see that in row 3, the away team is North Melbourne with a score of 9.12 (66). But the claim says \"fitzroy\". So the away team against fitzroy would be... looking at the table, in which row does fitzroy play as the home team?\n\nLooking at the first column, \"home team\", I see that one of the rows is \"fitzroy\" playing against \"collingwood\". In that row (row 5), the away team is Collingwood with a score of 12.15 (87). But the claim says the away team scored 9.12 (66) against fitzroy, which would mean that the away team in that game scored 9.12 (66). However, looking at row 3, it's North Melbourne who scored that, not Collingwood.\n\nSo perhaps I need to check if any row has the away team score as 9.12 (66) and the home team is fitzroy. Let me see: in row 5, the home team is fitzroy, but their opponent is collingwood, who scored higher. The away team's score there is 12.15 (87), not 9.12.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the away team score be 9.12 (66) play against fitzroy\". So it's the away team that scored 9.12 (66) in a game where fitzroy was the home team.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- North Melbourne vs Carlton: North Melb scored 9.12 (66), but they were away against Carlton.\n- Other away teams with scores like that are not playing against fitzroy.\n\nIn the table, I don't see any row where the away team is someone and the home team is fitzroy, except for the last entry: Hawthorn vs Richmond, which isn't relevant here. The only other is fitzroy's own game, where they scored 12.13 (85) against Collingwood.\n\nSo there's no match in the table where an away team scored 9.12 (66) against fitzroy. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because it refers to a score that doesn't exist in the context of fitzroy as the home team.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 0: st kilda (home), away is south melbourne.\n- Row1: Essendon (home) vs Melbourne\n- Row2: Carlton (home) vs North Melb\n- Row3: Geelong (home) vs Footscray\n- Row4: Fitzroy (home) vs Collingwood\n- Row5: Hawthorn (home) vs Richmond\n\nIn row4, the away team is Collingwood, who scored 12.15 (87). So no, there's no game where the away team scored 9.12 (66) against fitzroy.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it refers to a non-existent score in that context.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that an away team with a score of 9.12 (66) played against Fitzroy. Checking each row in the table, the only instance where the away team scored 9.12 (66) was against Carlton, not Fitzroy. Since there's no such game involving Fitzroy as the home team with this score, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
