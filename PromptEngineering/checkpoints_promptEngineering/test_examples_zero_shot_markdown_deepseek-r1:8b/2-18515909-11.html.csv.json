    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Geremi is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"player geremi have win only 1 fifa club world championship.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate Geremi in the table. Scanning through the names, I see Geremi listed at row index 14 with a total of 1.\n\nNext, I need to check which columns are relevant. The relevant columns here would be \"fifa club world championship\" because that's what the claim is about. So, looking at column headers, it's \"fifa club world championship.\"\n\nIn the table, Geremi's entry under this column is marked as 1. Since the claim says he only has one win in the FIFA Club World Cup, and the table shows exactly 1 in that category, the claim seems to hold true.\n\nI should make sure there are no other columns that might affect this conclusion. The \"name\" column just lists names, so it's not relevant. The other columns like \"la liga,\" \"copa del rey,\" etc., aren't mentioned in the claim, so they can be ignored for this specific check.\n\nTherefore, all the necessary information is present and supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"fifa club world championship\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
