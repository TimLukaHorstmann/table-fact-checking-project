    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"out of 38 game play , ipatinga have lost more than 14 game and drawn 8\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. They're talking about a team named ipatinga. I should check the table to find their data.\n\nLooking at the table, it's in markdown format with several columns: position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, and difference. Since the user provided the entire table, I can scan through each row to locate ipatinga.\n\nScanning down, I see that the team \"ipatinga\" is listed at position 20, which corresponds to row index 19 (since the first row is index 0). So, row_index is 19.\n\nNow, looking at the relevant columns for the claim: lost and drawn. In the table, these are represented by 'lost' and 'drawn'. \n\nIn row 19, under the 'lost' column, I see that ipatinga has a value of 21. Under 'drawn', it's 8.\n\nThe claim states that they have \"lost more than 14 games.\" So, checking if 21 is more than 14: yes, 21 > 14. That part checks out. \n\nAdditionally, the claim says they drew exactly 8 games. Looking at the table, drawn is indeed 8 for ipatinga. So both conditions of the claim are met.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. The row for ipatinga is the last one in the table. Their played matches are 38, as mentioned in the claim. They have lost 21 and drawn 8. So yes, they lost more than 14 (which is 21) and drew exactly 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sport have a difference of 3 with 52 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two things: a difference of 3 and having 52 points. The key here is that \"sport\" has both these attributes.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for \"sport.\" Scanning through each team, there's \"sport\" listed in position 11. So, let's focus on that row.\n\nIn the \"points\" column, it shows 52. That matches up with the claim's second part\u2014having 52 points. Now, checking the \"difference\" column for this row. The value is 3. That aligns perfectly with the first part of the claim about a difference of 3.\n\nSo, both conditions are satisfied: sport has 52 points and a difference of 3 against someone. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"sport have a difference of 3 with 52 point,\" we need to check two specific columns in the table for the team named \"sport.\"\n\n1. **Find the row for \"sport\":** Looking at the \"team\" column, the row for \"sport\" is at position 11.\n2. **Check the \"points\" column:** The value here is 52, matching the claim's point count.\n3. **Check the \"difference\" column:** The value here is 3, which matches the difference stated in the claim.\n\nSince both conditions are met, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"s\u00e3o paulo have no game draw\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that S\u00e3o Paulo has not drawn any games, meaning there are zero draws in their matches. To verify this, I'll need to look at the 'drawn' column for S\u00e3o Paulo and see if it's zero.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team, with columns like position, team name, points, played, drawn, lost, etc. So I should locate the row where the team is \"s\u00e3o paulo.\"\n\nSkimming through the 'team' column: position 1 is S\u00e3o Paulo. Their drawn column has a value of 12. Wait, that's not zero. That means they have had some draws.\n\nSo based on this, the claim that S\u00e3o Paulo has no game draw is false because according to the table, they have 12 drawn games.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says: \"ipitanga get 75 point with less than 30 game play , 17 of them lost.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts.\n\n1. **Points**: ipitanga should have 75 points.\n2. **Played Games**: They should have played fewer than 30 games (so total games <30).\n3. **Lost Games**: They should have 17 losses.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find ipitanga's data.\n\nLooking at the \"team\" column: the teams listed are in Portuguese, and I need to check if any team is named \"ipitanga\". Scanning through, I see a row where team is \"portuguesa\" (row 19), but not \"ipitanga.\" Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the last few rows are:\n- Row 16: n\u00e1utico\n- Row 17: figueirense\n- Row 18: vasco da gama\n- Row 19: portuguesa\n- Row 20: ipatinga\n\nOh, \"ipitanga\" isn't listed. Wait, maybe the claim is about a different team? Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or I misread. But according to the table, there's no team named \"ipitanga.\" The closest is row 20: ipatinga.\n\nBut the claim says \"ipitanga,\" so if that team isn't in the table, then maybe the claim is false because such a team doesn't exist with those stats. However, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe it's not about ipitanga but another team? No, the claim specifically mentions \"ipitanga.\" So if that team isn't in the table, then the claim is automatically false because there's no such team with 75 points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the team name. Let me check row 20 again: it says \"ipatinga,\" which is different from \"ipitanga.\" So indeed, there's no team named ipitanga in the table.\n\nTherefore, since the claim refers to a non-existent team or a typo, the claim can't be true because the team doesn't exist. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider if \"ipitanga\" is a different spelling or if it's actually another team.\n\nWait, perhaps \"ipatinga\" was meant to be \"ipitanga\"? But that's speculative. If so, let me check row 20 for ipatinga's data.\n\nRow 20: points=35, played=38, drawn=8, lost=21, against=67, difference=-30.\n\nSo if the team were ipatang, their points would be 35, not 75. So that doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, since there's no team named \"ipitanga\" with 75 points and the other stats mentioned in the claim, I think the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a non-existent team named \"ipitanga\" with specific stats that don't align with any team in the table. Since such a team isn't present, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
