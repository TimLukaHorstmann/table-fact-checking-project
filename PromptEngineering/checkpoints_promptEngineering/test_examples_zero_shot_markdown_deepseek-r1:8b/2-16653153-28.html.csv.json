    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the crowd size at Hisense Arena on February 8th is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reviewing the instructions and the data provided.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"On 8 february , the crowd at hisense arena be 8093.\" My task is to check this against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a markdown table with several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The relevant parts for the claim would likely be the date, venue, and crowd column since they directly relate to the specifics of the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions \"8 february,\" so I need to look at all rows where the date is February 8th. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: 4 february\n- Row 1: 4 february\n- Row 2: 6 february\n- Row 3: 6 february\n- Row 4: 7 february\n- Row 5: 7 february\n- Row 6: 7 february\n- Row 7: 8 february\n\nOnly row 7 has the date 8 february. Now, looking at that row, the home team is South Dragons, and they're playing against Melbourne Tigers. The venue for this game is Hisense Arena.\n\nNext, I need to check the crowd number for this specific game. In row 7, under the \"crowd\" column, it says 8093. That matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nSo, the claim is referring to the correct date and venue. Since the crowd number in that particular row of the table is indeed 8093, the claim appears to be true based on the data provided.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows with the same date or venue that might affect this assessment. However, the date specified is only February 8th, and the only entry for that date in the table has a crowd of 8093 at Hisense Arena. There's no conflicting information elsewhere that would negate this data point.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each relevant cell, I can confidently say that the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the provided table, as the crowd size on February 8th at Hisense Arena matches the stated number of attendees.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "on 7 february , the box score show that the away team be the new zealand breaker",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"On 7 February, the box score shows that the away team is the New Zealand Breakers.\" So, I need to find in the table if there's a match on 7 February where the away team is the New Zealand Breakers and their score is mentioned in the box score column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The date column lists various dates in February 2023, including 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th.\n\nI need to focus on the rows where the date is 7 February because that's the day mentioned in the claim. So, I'll check row indices 3 and 4 since the table starts counting from row index 0, but actually, looking at the markdown, the first row after headers is 4 february as row 0, so maybe my count is off. Wait, no, the headers are the first row, then each date corresponds to subsequent rows.\n\nWait, in the markdown table, the headers are:\n\n| date       | home team             | score    | away team            | venue                           |   crowd | box score   | report   |\n\nThen the data rows start from 4 february as row 0. So for 7 February, that's four rows down, which would be row index 3 and 4.\n\nSo, for row indices 3 and 4 (which correspond to 7 February), let's check each relevant column.\n\nEach of these rows has the following columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, report.\n\nThe claim mentions the box score showing that the away team is New Zealand Breakers. So I need to look at the \"away team\" column for 7 February games and see if any of them are the New Zealand Breakers.\n\nLooking at row index 3: date is 7 February, home team is Adelaide 36ers, away team is New Zealand Breakers. The score is 102 - 91. So here, the away team is indeed New Zealand Breakers. Also, there's a box score column with the value \"box score\", but that might not be relevant because it just says \"box score\" without numbers.\n\nNext, row index 4: date is 7 February, home team is Cairns Taipans, away team is Gold Coast Blaze. The score is 88 - 93. So here, the away team isn't New Zealand Breakers.\n\nSo in row index 3, the away team matches the claim. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row index 3 (7 February), we need to check the \"away team\" column because that's where the New Zealand Breakers are listed as the away team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because on 7 February, the box score shows that the away team was the New Zealand Breakers in one of the games. The relevant cell is the \"away team\" column for that specific row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"February 4 have a score smaller than 4485\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions February 4 and compares the score of that day to 4485. So, I need to look into the table for entries on February 4 and check their scores.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents a specific date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The dates listed are from 4th February to 8th February. \n\nNow, focusing on February 4, there are two games listed:\n1. South Dragons vs Adelaide 36ers with a score of 97 - 77.\n2. Sydney Spirit vs Cairns Taipans with a score of 81 - 89.\n\nEach game has its own score, but the claim refers to \"a score,\" which I think is referring to each individual game's score on that day. So I need to check if any of these scores are smaller than 4485.\n\nLooking at the scores:\n- The first game: 97 - 77. Let me calculate that as 97 minus 77, which equals 20.\n- The second game: 81 - 89. Wait, is it 81 minus 89 or 89 minus 81? Typically, the score format in sports is [home team] - [away team], so I think it's 81 by Sydney Spirit against 89 by Cairns Taipans. So the score for the game would be 81 points for the home team and 89 for the away team.\n\nNow, each of these scores (20 and 89) is definitely smaller than 4485. Therefore, on February 4, there are games where the score is smaller than 4485.\n\nSo, to verify this claim, I need to check all the relevant cells in the table that pertain to February 4 and their respective game scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on February 4, a game's score was smaller than 4485. From the table, both games on February 4 have scores (20 and 89) that are less than 4485.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the state sport centre be the home ground of the south dragon\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. The venue is the \"state sports centre\".\n2. This venue is the home ground for the \"south dragons\".\n\nI need to verify both points from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played on a specific date. The columns include the date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The relevant columns for this claim are \"venue\" and whether the home team is the \"south dragons\".\n\nSo, I should check all rows where the home team is the south dragons and see what their venues are.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is south dragons, venue is hisense arena.\n- Row 1: Home team is sydney spirit, venue is state sports centre. So this doesn't apply to south dragons.\n- Row 2: Home team is townsville crocodiles, venue is townsville entertainment centre.\n- Row 3: Home team is wollongong hawks, venue is win entertainment centre.\n- Row 4: Home team is adelaide 36ers, venue is distinctive homes dome.\n- Row 5: Home team is cairns taipans, venue is cairns convention centre.\n- Row 6: Home team is perth wildcats, venue is challenge stadium.\n- Row 7: Home team is south dragons again, venue is hisense arena.\n\nSo, the south dragons are playing at hisense arena on two occasions. The state sports centre is mentioned as the venue for sydney spirit's game, but not for south dragons. Therefore, the claim that the state sport centre is their home ground is incorrect because the south dragons don't play there.\n\nI should also check if any other rows have south dragons at state sports centre, but from the table, it doesn't seem so.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"state sports centre\" is the home ground of the \"south dragons.\" However, checking all relevant rows in the table shows that the south dragons play at \"hisense arena,\" not at the \"state sports centre.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
