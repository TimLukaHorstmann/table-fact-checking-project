    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the county that joined after 1926 and have participated in the olympic conference be 35 huntington.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts. Let's see:\n\n1. **County Joined After 1926**: This means we're looking for counties where the 'year joined' is greater than 1926.\n2. **Participated in Olympic Conference**: From the table, the 'previous conference' column might be relevant here. Since the olympic conference is mentioned in the claim, I need to find if any county's previous conference was 'olympic'.\n3. **County Name**: The claim specifies it should be \"35 huntington\". Looking at the table, there's a row for Huntington North with location 'huntington' and the county is 35 huntington.\n\nNow, checking the table:\n\n- Go through each row to find counties joined after 1926.\n- Then check if their previous conference is 'olympic'.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Anderson joined in 1926. So not after 1926.\n- Huntington North joined in 2003, which is after 1926.\n- Kokomo joined in 1926. Not after.\n- Logansport in 1926. Not after.\n- Marion in 1933. After.\n- Muncie in 1926. Not after.\n- New Castle Chrysler in 1926. Not after.\n- Richmond in 1926. Not after.\n\nSo potential counties are Huntington North, Marion.\n\nNow check their previous conference:\n\n- Huntington North: previous conference is 'olympic'.\n- Marion: previous conference is 'independents'.\n\nTherefore, only Huntington North meets both conditions: joined after 1926 and participated in the olympic conference.\n\nThe claim says \"35 huntington\". In the table, the county for Huntington North is listed as 35 huntington. So that matches.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are satisfied.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"olympic have an ihsaa class / football / soccer of 4a / 5a / 2a and join after 1926.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column called \"ihsaa class / football / soccer.\" The value for this column seems to be a combination of different classifications. For example, Anderson has \"4a / 5a / 2a,\" which probably means they participate in multiple levels or divisions: 4a, 5a, and 2a.\n\nThe next part is about the year joined. The claim says \"join after 1926.\" So I need to check when each school joined the conference, looking for Olympic, but actually, looking through the table, I don't see a row with \"olympic\" as the school name. Wait, maybe it's in there.\n\nWait, let me go through the table again:\n\nThe schools listed are: anderson, huntington north, kokomo, logansport community, marion, muncie central, new castle chrysler, richmond. Hmm, no \"olympic\" school here. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check each row carefully.\n\n- Anderson\n- Huntington North\n- Kokomo\n- Logansport Community\n- Marion\n- Muncie Central\n- New Castle Chrysler\n- Richmond\n\nNo Olympic listed as a school. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no such school in the table with \"olympic\" as the name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"Olympic\" refers to something else, like a conference or mascot? But the column \"previous conference\" shows things like \"independents\" and \"olympic,\" but that seems to be the conference name, not the school's name.\n\nWait, no: looking at the table again, each row represents a school. The columns are: school (name), location, mascot, county, enrollment, ihsaa class/football/soccer, year joined, previous conference.\n\nSo the \"school\" column lists the names. None of them are Olympic. So the claim is referring to a school named Olympic, which isn't in the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because such a school doesn't exist in the provided data.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misreading something. Let me check each row's \"school\" column again:\n\n1. anderson\n2. huntington north\n3. kokomo\n4. logansport community\n5. marion\n6. muncie central\n7. new castle chrysler\n8. richmond\n\nNo Olympic here. So the claim mentions \"olympic,\" but there's no corresponding school in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"huntington north , viking as the mascot , join in 2003.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions three things:\n\n1. The school name is Huntington North.\n2. The mascot is Viking.\n3. The year they joined is 2003.\n\nI'll go through each part to check against the table.\n\nLooking at the table headers: school, location, mascot, county, enrollment, ihsaa class / football / soccer, year joined, previous conference.\n\nSo the relevant columns are \"school,\" \"mascot,\" and \"year joined.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: the school name. In the table, under the \"school\" column, I see entries like Anderson, Huntington North, Kokomo, etc. So Huntington North is definitely a row in the table.\n\nNext, checking the mascot for Huntington North. Looking at the \"mascot\" column, for each row:\n\n- Anderson: Indians\n- Huntington North: Vikings\n- Kokomo: Wildkats\n- Logansport Community: Berries\n- Marion: Giants\n- Muncie Central: Bearcats\n- New Castle Chrysler: Trojans\n- Richmond: Red Devils\n\nYes, Huntington North has the Viking mascot. So that's correct.\n\nNow, checking the year they joined. The \"year joined\" column shows years like 1926, 2003, etc. Looking at the row for Huntington North, their year joined is listed as 2003. That matches the claim.\n\nSo all three parts of the claim are accurate based on the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim is: \"when the school be logansport community , the mascot be berries\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: school, location, mascot, county, enrollment, ihsaa class/football/soccer, year joined, previous conference. I'm interested in verifying two things here: that the school is \"logansport community\" and that its mascot is \"berries\".\n\nLooking through each row of the table to find the relevant cells:\n\n1. The first column is \"school\". I'll check each row's school name.\n   - Row 0: Anderson\n   - Row 1: Huntington North\n   - Row 2: Kokomo\n   - Row 3: Logansport Community\n   - This matches the school name in the claim.\n\n2. The second column is \"location\". It might be useful to cross-check, but since the claim uses the full school name, I think the location isn't necessary unless there's a duplicate, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\n3. Next, the third column is \"mascot\". For Logansport Community, checking row 3:\n   - Mascot is listed as \"berries\".\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: school name is Logansport Community and mascot is berries. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant columns are \"school\" and \"mascot\". For Logansport Community, their row index is 3 (since it's zero-indexed), so:\n\n- For school: row_index 3, column_name \"school\"\n- For mascot: row_index 3, column_name \"mascot\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are these two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because the Logansport Community school has a mascot of berries. The table confirms both the school name and mascot.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim about Anderson School is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the claim first: \"Anderson school have an 1884 enrollment in 48 madison county and have a viking mascot.\"\n\nOkay, let's parse this into two main parts. The first part is about enrollment numbers and location, and the second part is about the mascot.\n\nStarting with the enrollment. I need to check if Anderson School has an enrollment of 1884 in Madison County. Looking at the table, each row represents a school with various attributes. So, let's focus on the row for Anderson.\n\nIn the table, the first column is \"school,\" and the second is \"location.\" The third column is \"mascot.\" There's also a \"county\" column. So for Anderson, the location is Anderson, which matches the claim since it says \"Anderson school.\"\n\nLooking at the enrollment numbers: each row has an \"enrollment\" cell, but in this table, I notice that under \"enrollment,\" there are numbers like 1884, 1750, etc. Wait, actually, looking closely, the enrollment column is labeled as such, and Anderson's enrollment is 1884.\n\nSo, first condition: does Anderson have an enrollment of 1884? Yes, according to the table. Now, the claim says it's in \"48 madison county.\" So I need to check if the county for Anderson is Madison County with a code of 48.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"county,\" Anderson has \"48 madison.\" That matches exactly: Madison County, code 48. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the mascot. The claim says they have a \"viking\" mascot. Looking at the table again, the \"mascot\" column for Anderson is listed as \"indians.\" Wait, that's not matching the claim of \"vikings.\"\n\nSo here's a discrepancy: the table shows Anderson's mascot as Indians, but the claim says Vikings. That means one part of the claim doesn't align with the table.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the table to make sure I'm reading it correctly. So the rows are:\n\n1. anderson | anderson | indians | 48 madison | 1884 | ...\n2. huntington north | huntington | vikings | 35 huntington | 1750 | ...\n\nSo yes, Anderson's mascot is Indians, not Vikings. That means the claim about the mascot is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, while the enrollment and county information matches, the mascot doesn't. So the overall claim isn't fully supported because one of its statements is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Anderson School has an 1884 enrollment in 48 Madison County and a Viking mascot. The table confirms the enrollment and location but lists \"indians\" as the mascot, not \"vikings.\" \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Check Enrollment:** Verify if Anderson's enrollment is 1884. Yes, it is.\n2. **Verify Location:** Ensure the school is in Madison County with code 48. The table confirms this.\n3. **Mascot Check:** Look at Anderson's mascot. It's listed as \"indians,\" not \"vikings.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** While two parts of the claim are accurate, the mascot part is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the / county that have a year join less than 1926 , and a previous conference of independent be 35 huntington.\" Hmm, there's a typo in the first part\u2014\"the / county\"\u2014I think it's meant to say \"the county that...\" So I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main conditions:\n1. The county must have a year joined less than 1926.\n2. The previous conference for that county is \"independent.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various attributes, including the county. I need to check each county to see if both conditions are met.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Anderson (row 0)**: County is Madison, year joined 1926. Since 1926 isn't less than 1926, it doesn't meet the first condition.\n2. **Huntington North (row 1)**: County is Huntington, previous conference \"Olympic.\" Doesn't matter for previous conference since we're looking for \"Independent.\"\n3. **Kokomo (row 2)**: County is Howard, year joined 1926. Same as Anderson; doesn't meet the first condition.\n4. **Logansport Community (row 3)**: County is Cass, year joined 1926. Again, not less than 1926.\n5. **Marion (row 4)**: County is Grant, year joined 1933. That's after 1926, so doesn't meet the first condition.\n6. **Muncie Central (row 5)**: County is Delaware, year joined 1926. Doesn't meet the first condition.\n7. **New Castle Chrysler (row 6)**: County is Henry, year joined 1926. Not less than 1926.\n8. **Richmond (row 7)**: County is Wayne, year joined 1926. Same as others.\n\nWait a minute, I didn't see any county with a year joined less than 1926 in the table. The earliest is Kokomo and Anderson at 1926, which isn't less than that. So there might be no counties meeting the first condition.\n\nBut let's double-check each row to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\n- **Anderson (row 0)**: Year joined 1926. Not less.\n- **Huntington North (row 1)**: Year 2003, but we're checking for less than 1926? No, because 2003 is after 1926.\nWait, actually, the condition is year joined less than 1926. So any school with a year joined before 1926 would qualify.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- **Logansport Community (row 3)**: Year joined 1926.\n- **Marion (row 4)**: Joined in 1933.\n- The rest are either 1926 or later, except maybe none. So no schools have a year joined before 1926, which would make the first condition impossible.\n\nTherefore, there's no county that meets both conditions because there are no counties with a year join less than 1926. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires a county to have both a year of joining before 1926 and a previous conference of \"Independent.\" Since none of the counties in the table meet this criteria, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully reading and understanding both the table and the claim.\n\nThe table has several columns: school, location, mascot, county, enrollment, ihsaa class/football/soccer, year joined, and previous conference. There are eight rows of data for different schools.\n\nThe claim says: \"independent be the previous conference that have an ihsaa class / football / soccer of 3a / 4a / 2a , and a year join larger than 1926\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's stating two conditions for the 'previous conference' being \"independent\":\n\n1. The previous conference must have an ihsaa class/football/soccer combination of \"3a / 4a / 2a\".\n2. These conferences joined before or in the year 1926, but wait\u2014the claim says \"year join larger than 1926,\" which means a later year after 1926, not earlier. However, looking at the table data, all relevant entries for 'previous conference' are from 1926 onwards, so I might need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, no. The claim is saying that the previous conference has an ihsaa class/football/soccer of \"3a / 4a / 2a\" and a year joined larger than 1926. So they must have joined after 1926? But looking at the table, all the entries for 'year joined' are 1926 or later except for Huntington North which is 2003.\n\nWait no, let me double-check the data:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Anderson: year joined 1926\n2. Kokomo: 1926\n3. Logansport: 1926\n4. Marion: 1933\n5. Muncie Central: 1926\n6. New Castle Chrysler: 1926\n7. Richmond: 1926\n8. Huntington North: 2003\n\nSo, the 'year joined' is all before 1926 except for Huntington North in 2003. Wait no\u2014the claim says \"year join larger than 1926,\" meaning the school joined after 1926. But all entries except Huntington North are 1926 or earlier (since 1926 is not larger than, it's equal). So maybe the claim is incorrect because none of them joined after 1926.\n\nBut let me also check the ihsaa class/football/soccer column. The possible values from the table are:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Anderson: 4a / 5a / 2a\n- Huntington North: 4a / 5a / 2a\n- Kokomo: 4a / 5a / 2a\n- Logansport: 4a / 4a / 2a\n- Marion: 4a / 4a / 2a\n- Muncie Central: 3a / 4a / 2a\n- New Castle Chrysler: 4a / 4a / 2a\n- Richmond: 4a / 5a / 2a\n\nThe claim specifies that the previous conference has an ihsaa class/football/soccer of \"3a / 4a / 2a\". So, looking at the table, Muncie Central is the only one with that combination. Its previous conference is listed as 'independent'.\n\nNow, checking if all independent conferences have this specific ihsaa class combination and a year joined larger than 1926.\n\nFirst, identify which schools have their previous conference as \"independent\":\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Anderson: independents\n- Kokomo: independents\n- Logansport: independents\n- Marion: independents\n- Muncie Central: independents\n- New Castle Chrysler: independents\n- Richmond: independents\n\nSo all these seven schools are listed with 'previous conference' as \"independent\".\n\nBut according to the claim, these independent conferences must have an ihsaa class/football/soccer of \"3a / 4a / 2a\". However, in reality:\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Muncie Central is the only one with that combination.\n- The rest have combinations like 4a / 5a / 2a or similar.\n\nSo, not all independent conferences meet the ihsaa class condition. Only Muncie Central does. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's making a general statement about all 'independent' previous conferences when in fact only one meets both conditions.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the year joined, since none of them joined after 1926 except Huntington North, but Huntington North's previous conference is not listed as independent\u2014it's \"olympic\". So even if we consider that, it doesn't help the claim.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- The claim says all 'independent' previous conferences have a specific ihsaa class and joined after 1926.\n- In reality, only Muncie Central meets the ihsaa class condition, and none joined after 1926 except Huntington North, which is not an independent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it's making a general statement that doesn't hold true for all relevant schools.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class / football / soccer\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year joined\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class / football / soccer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the claim: \"huntington north in location kokomo join in 2003 and have a viking mascot.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down each part of the claim and check against the table provided.\n\nStarting with \"huntington north\": Looking at the table, there's a row for \"huntington north\" where school is \"huntington north,\" location is \"huntington,\" mascot is \"vikings,\" county is \"35 huntington,\" enrollment is 1750, and so on.

Maybe the claim is mixing up locations or there's a typo.\n\nThen, \"join in 2003\": Checking the table, under \"year joined,\" for \"huntington north\" it says 2003. So that part checks out.\n\nLastly, \"have a viking mascot\": In the table, \"huntington north\" has a mascot of \"vikings.\" That's correct too.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions the location as \"kokomo,\" which doesn't match \"huntington north\"'s location of \"huntington.\" So is the claim referring to a different row? Let me check if there's another school in kokomo. Looking through the table, I see that \"kokomo\" is a separate school located in \"kokomo,\" with its own details.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrectly associating \"huntington north\" with \"kokomo\" as their location, which isn't accurate. The correct location for \"huntington north\" is \"huntington,\" not \"kokomo.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim has a mistake in the location part. Even though \"huntington north\" did join in 2003 and has a Viking mascot, the incorrect location makes the overall claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"huntington north\" is located in \"kokomo,\" whereas it's actually in \"huntington.\" This inconsistency makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the berries be mascot for logansport community school in kokomo\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It's saying that \"berries\" are the mascot of Logansport Community School located in Kokomo. So I need to check if there's a row in the table where the school is Logansport Community and the location is Kokomo, with the mascot being Berries.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes like location, mascot, county, enrollment, etc. I'll go through each row to see which ones match.\n\n1. **Row 0**: School is Anderson, located in Anderson. Mascot is Indians. Not relevant because it's not Logansport or Kokomo.\n\n2. **Row 1**: School is Huntington North, located in Huntington. Mascot is Vikings. Again, not matching the claim.\n\n3. **Row 2**: School is Kokomo, located in Kokomo. Mascot is Wildkats. Hmm, this seems relevant because it's in Kokomo, but the mascot isn't Berries. So this doesn't support the claim.\n\n4. **Row 3**: This row is Logansport Community School, which is located in Logansport, not Kokomo. So even though the mascot here is Berries, the location doesn't match the claim.\n\n5. **Rows 4 and beyond**: Schools like Marion, Muncie Central, New Castle Chrysler, and Richmond are all different locations and mascots, so none of these apply to Kokomo or Logansport Community School.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have misread something. The claim says \"Logansport Community School in Kokomo.\" But looking at the table, Logansport Community is in Logansport, not Kokomo. So there's no row where both school and location are Logansport Community and Kokomo.\n\nSo the claim seems to be mixing up the location with another school. The only relevant rows are Row 2 (Kokomo, Wildkats) and Row 3 (Logansport, Berries), but neither matches all parts of the claim correctly. Therefore, there's no row that has both Logansport Community as the school, Kokomo as the location, and Berries as the mascot.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by any single row in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the table because there's no matching row for Logansport Community School located in Kokomo with Berries as the mascot.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
