The claim says, \"both the bellevue bruin and the york panther play in the midland conference.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Let me check each school mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with \"Bellevue University,\" looking at the mascot column, it's the Bellevue Bruins. Now, checking their conference, it says Midlands. So that part checks out because they are indeed in the Midlands conference.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the York Panther. Checking the table for York College, the mascot is listed as York Panthers. Their conference is also Midlands. So York Panthers play in the Midlands conference too.\n\nWait a second, both of them being in Midlands would mean that the statement is correct because both are indeed in the Midland conference. But let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. \n\nI should double-check each relevant cell to be certain. For Bellevue University, school row index 0, mascot is Bruins, conference is Midlands. That's correct.\n\nFor York College, school row index is 6 (since it's the last one), mascot is Panthers, conference is Midlands. So both are in Midlands, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"only 1 school, york college, have won more than 20 titles.\" Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and understand what columns are relevant. The columns we have are: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. Since the claim is about the number of national titles, I need to focus on that column specifically.\n\nNext, I'll check each row in the national titles column. Let's list out the values:\n\n- Bellevue University: 14\n- College of Saint Mary: 0\n- Concordia University: 1\n- Doane College: 10\n- Hastings College: 3\n- Midland University: 2\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19\n- Peru State College: 2\n- York College: 28\n\nNow, the claim is that only York College has more than 20 titles. So I need to see how many schools have 20 or more.\n\nLooking at each number:\n- Bellevue: 14 \u2192 less than 20.\n- Saint Mary: 0 \u2192 definitely less.\n- Concordia: 1 \u2192 nope.\n- Doane: 10 \u2192 still less.\n- Hastings: 3 \u2192 not there yet.\n- Midland: 2 \u2192 no.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan: 19 \u2192 just under 20.\n- Peru State: 2 \u2192 nope.\n- York College: 28 \u2192 way over.\n\nSo, how many schools have more than 20 titles? Only York College. That seems to fit the claim. Wait, but let me double-check in case I missed any. Scanning through again, none of the others are close to 20 except Nebraska Wesleyan with 19, which is just one short. So that's still less.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"only 1 school, york college, have won more than 20 titles\" holds true because York College is the only one above 20.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check how many schools have national titles exceeding 20. Only York College meets this criterion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"with a total of 0, the lowest number of national title belongs to the college of saint mary.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It's about the number of national titles each school has and identifying which one has the lowest. The user mentioned that Saint Mary's has 0 national titles. So, my task is to verify this by checking the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The key column here is \"national titles.\" I'll need to look at each row's national titles value.\n\nLet me list out the national titles from each school:\n\n1. Bellevue University - 14\n2. College of Saint Mary - 0\n3. Concordia University - 1\n4. Doane College - 10\n5. Hastings College - 3\n6. Midland University - 2\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 19\n8. Peru State College - 2\n9. York College - 28\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest number of national titles among these schools. The claim says that Saint Mary's has 0, which would logically be the lowest since all other schools have at least 1 or more.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- Bellevue has 14\n- Saint Mary has 0\n- Concordia has 1\n- Doane has 10\n- Hastings has 3\n- Midland has 2\n- Nebraska Wesleyan has 19\n- Peru State has 2\n- York has 28\n\nSo, the lowest number here is indeed 0, which is Saint Mary's. Therefore, the claim seems to be correct.\n\nNow, I need to check the instructions about the relevant cells. The user wants a JSON object that includes the answer and a list of relevant cells. Each relevant cell should have \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a school. The national titles are in the fourth column. So, for Saint Mary's, their row index is 1 (since it starts from 0), and the column name is \"national titles.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cell would be row_index 1 and column_name \"national titles.\"\n\nPutting this together, I need to structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"According to the date of founding, Peru State College be the oldest.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It\u2019s stating that based on the founding year of each college listed in the table, Peru State College has the earliest foundation date, making it the oldest among them.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n| school                       | mascot             | conference   |   national titles |   founded |\n|:-----------------------------|:-------------------|:-------------|------------------:|----------:|\n| bellevue university          | bellevue bruins    | midlands     |                14 |      1966 |\n| college of saint mary        | saint mary flames  | midlands     |                 0 |      1923 |\n| concordia university         | concordia bulldogs | great plains |                 1 |      1894 |\n| doane college                | doane tigers       | great plains |                10 |      1872 |\n| hastings college             | hastings broncos   | great plains |                 3 |      1882 |\n| midland university           | midland warriors   | great plains |                 2 |      1883 |\n| nebraska wesleyan university | nw prairie wolves  | great plains |                19 |      1887 |\n| peru state college           | peru state bobcats | midlands     |                 2 |      1865 |\n| york college                 | york panthers      | midlands     |                28 |      1890 |\n\nI need to focus on the \"founded\" column because the claim is about the date of founding. So, I should extract all the founded years from this column.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nNow, I need to find out which school has the earliest founded year. The claim says Peru State College is the oldest, so its founded year should be the smallest.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n1865 is the smallest number here. Let me confirm that no other college in the table has a founded year earlier than 1865.\n\nChecking each one:\n\n- Bellevue: 1966 (later)\n- Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia: 1894\n- Doane: 1872\nWait, wait, hold on. Doane College is founded in 1872, which is earlier than Peru State's 1865? No, 1865 is earlier than 1872 because 18 vs. 19 century.\n\nSo, 1865 is the earliest, making Peru State College the oldest among them.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nPeru State: 1865\n\nDoane: 1872\n\nSo yes, Peru State's founded year is 1865, which is earlier than Doane's 1872. Therefore, Peru State is indeed the oldest based on the date of founding.\n\nNow, to make sure I didn't miss any other colleges with a more recent or earlier founding date:\n\nLooking through all the founded years again:\n\nPeru State: 1865\n\nDoane: 1872\n\nHastings: 1882\n\nMidland: 1883\n\nNebraska Wesleyan: 1887\n\nConcordia: 1894\n\nCollege of Saint Mary: 1923\n\nBellevue University: 1966\n\nYork College: 1890\n\nSo, Peru State is the first one, founded in 1865. No college in the table was founded earlier than that. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to find which cells are relevant for this verification. The claim refers to the \"founded\" column and the school name of Peru State College.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nColumns are: school, mascot, conference, national titles, founded.\n\nSo, for Peru State College, it's in row 7 (since we start counting from 0 or 1? Let me check the markdown. In the table, the first row is index 0, I think.\n\nYes, looking at the markdown, each row starts with a | and then the data. So, the first data row is bellevue university as row 0.\n\nSo Peru State College is in row 7 (since it's the 8th entry). Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The \"founded\" cell for Peru State College: 1865\n- The \"school\" cell for Peru State College to identify which college we're talking about.\n\nWait, but actually, to verify the claim, I need to confirm both that Peru State's founded year is indeed the earliest and that it's correctly identified in the table.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. For Peru State College: row_index=7, column_name=\"founded\"\n2. Possibly also the \"school\" column for its entry (row 7) to ensure we're looking at the correct row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the \"founded\" cell is sufficient because all other schools are in different rows and columns, but perhaps the school name is needed to confirm it's Peru State College.\n\nWait, no. Because if I just take the founded column, without tying it back to the specific school, then someone might argue that another school has a lower number, but in this case, since Peru State's number is indeed the lowest, and it's correctly identified as Peru State College, so the relevant cells would be:\n\n- The \"founded\" cell for Peru State (row 7)\n- Possibly the \"school\" cell for row 7 to confirm it's Peru State.\n\nBut I think in this case, since the claim is about Peru State being the oldest based on their founded date, the relevant cells are just the \"founded\" column and perhaps the school name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's enough to check the value of the \"founded\" cell for Peru State because that's what the claim refers to.\n\nWait, let me think. The claim is about Peru State College being the oldest according to their founding date. So, to verify this, I need to:\n\n1. Check the founded year of Peru State: 1865\n2. Ensure that no other school in the table has a founded year earlier than 1865.\n\nTherefore, to verify this, I would look at the \"founded\" column for each row and compare, but since the claim is specifically about Peru State College, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The \"founded\" cell of Peru State (row 7)\n- Perhaps the school name cell of Peru State (row 7) to confirm which row it's in.\n\nWait, but do I need to check all other schools' founded years? Or is it sufficient that Peru State's founded year is the lowest?\n\nIn the instructions, they say: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" So, if the claim is fully supported by the table, meaning that based on the data, Peru State College has the earliest founding date among all listed schools.\n\nTherefore, to check this, I need to compare all the founded years. But since the instruction is about which cells are relevant, not which information, perhaps the cells involved in verifying the claim would be:\n\n- The \"founded\" value for Peru State (row 7)\n- And possibly the other \"founded\" values of other schools.\n\nBut that might complicate things because then I have to look at all the founded columns.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about Peru State being the oldest based on their founded date, and assuming that no other school in the table has a lower number, so perhaps the relevant cells are just the \"founded\" cell for Peru State and maybe the \"school\" cell for Peru State to confirm it's correctly identified.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about the entire table, then all the \"founded\" columns might be relevant because you have to check each one. But that seems excessive.\n\nWait, but in reality, only the value of Peru State's founded date and comparing it against others would determine if the claim is true. However, as per the instructions, I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- The \"founded\" cell for Peru State (row 7)\n- Possibly the other \"founded\" cells to check that no one has a lower number.\n\nBut that's not practical because it would mean listing all of them. So perhaps just the \"founded\" value of Peru State is sufficient, as the claim is about their founding date being the earliest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both the school name and founded cell for Peru State are relevant because you need to confirm it's indeed Peru State that has the lowest number.\n\nWait, but if I only check Peru State's founded cell, but another school also has a lower number, then I wouldn't know unless I check all. So, perhaps in this context, since I can see that Doane is 1872 and Peru is 1865, which is earlier, so maybe it's sufficient to just look at Peru's founded cell.\n\nBut given the structure of the problem, I think they want us to identify the specific cells relevant for verifying the claim. So, in this case:\n\n1. For Peru State College: row_index=7 (since counting from 0), column_name=\"founded\" with value 1865\n2. Additionally, maybe the \"school\" cell at row 7 to confirm which school it is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the \"founded\" cell of Peru State is needed because that's the direct information to verify the claim.\n\nI think in this case, since the claim is about the founding date of Peru State College, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The \"founded\" cell at row 7\n- Possibly the \"school\" cell at row 7 to confirm it's Peru State.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to find an example. If someone claims that \"John is the shortest person in the group,\" then the relevant cells would be John's height and all others' heights, right? So similarly, for the claim about Peru State College being the oldest based on founding date, we need to look at all schools' founded dates.\n\nBut since this seems like a larger dataset, maybe in the context of the problem, only the cell for Peru State's founded date is needed because comparing it against others would be implied. But perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, if I have to pick specific cells, then the \"founded\" column and the \"school\" column for Peru State are relevant.\n\nBut given that the table also includes other columns like mascot, conference, national titles, those might not be directly relevant unless someone argues that another factor affects being 'oldest.' But in this case, it's purely about the founding date.\n\nTherefore, to avoid overcomplicating, I think the two relevant cells are:\n\n1. For Peru State College: row_index=7, column_name=\"founded\" (value 1865)\n2. Maybe also row 7, column_name=\"school\" to confirm which school it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the founded cell because the claim is about the founding date.\n\nI think I need to list both as relevant cells.\n\nSo, final answer: Relevant cells are the \"founded\" cell for Peru State (row 7) and perhaps the \"school\" cell at row 7.\n\nBut considering the problem's structure, it might be sufficient to just reference the \"founded\" cell of Peru State College.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim is: \"Peru State College has the earliest founding date among all colleges listed in this table.\"\n\nTo verify that, we need to check each college's founded year. Therefore, to confirm this claim, the relevant data would be:\n\n- For Peru State: founded=1865\n- For Doane: 1872\n- For Hastings: 1882\n- For Midland: 1883\n- For Nebraska Wesleyan: 1887\n- For Concordia: 1894\n- For College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- For Bellevue University: 1966\n- For Peru State: 1865\n\nTherefore, to verify the claim, we need to examine all these \"founded\" cells.\n\nBut since the problem says \"you are tasked with verifying a claim,\" and given that it's only about Peru State being the first, then if you can confirm that no other college has a founded year earlier than 1865, then the claim holds. So, perhaps in this case, looking at all \"founded\" cells is necessary.\n\nBut as per instructions, maybe list all the \"founded\" columns as relevant because they contain data needed to verify the claim. Alternatively, since the task is to identify specific cells, maybe only the one for Peru State.\n\nWait, but if someone were to challenge the claim, they might say \"but Doane has a lower number,\" so we need to have checked all of them.\n\nTherefore, as a responsible person verifying the claim, I should look at all colleges' founded years. But in terms of specific cells, that would mean all \"founded\" cells across the table.\n\nBut perhaps for this problem, since it's about a single cell (Peru State), then only that one is relevant because if we can confirm its value and compare to others, which might require looking at other cells as well. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to list all columns related to the claim. Since the claim is about founding date, all \"founded\" cells are relevant.\n\nBut given that this could be an open-ended task, perhaps the answer should focus on the specific cell for Peru State and mention the comparison with others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think it's safer to state that the relevant data is in the \"founded\" column for each college, including Peru State at row 7.\n\nBut maybe since it's about a single claim, only Peru State's founded cell is directly related. However, without checking all the others, one cannot confirm if the claim is true.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I need to answer as follows:\n\nTo verify the claim that \"Peru State College has the earliest founding date among all colleges listed,\" we must examine the \"founded\" year for each college in the table. The relevant cell is the \"founded\" value for Peru State College at row 7, which is 1865. Additionally, comparing this with other colleges' founded years (e.g., Doane's 1872) confirms that Peru State indeed has the earliest founding date.\n\nTherefore, the key cell is the \"founded\" entry for Peru State College.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of instructions, I need to list the specific cells. So, maybe:\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 7, Column: Founded (Value: 1865)\n- All other Rows, Column: Founded\n\nBut it's a bit unclear. Alternatively, since the question is about identifying which data is needed, not necessarily all, I think just the Peru State cell is enough because the claim is specifically about them.\n\nIn conclusion, after careful consideration, I believe that the primary relevant cell is the \"founded\" entry for Peru State College at row 7.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"Peru State College has the earliest founding date among all colleges listed,\" the relevant data point is the \"Founded\" year for Peru State College. This information can be found in the table under:\n\n- **Row 7, Column: Founded**  \n  Value: 1865\n\nBy comparing this value with other colleges' founded years (e.g., Doane's 1872), it is confirmed that Peru State College indeed has the earliest founding date.\n\n### Answer:\nThe relevant cell is located at Row 7, Column: Founded, which contains the value 1865.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"In term of its founding date, the youngest school be Bellevue University.\" So, I need to check if Bellevue University is indeed the youngest school when considering their founding dates.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with columns like mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. My main focus here is on the \"founded\" column because the claim is about the founding date.\n\nLet me list out the schools along with their founding years as extracted from the table:\n\n1. Bellevue University - 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary - 1923\n3. Concordia University - 1894\n4. Doane College - 1872\n5. Hastings College - 1882\n6. Midland University - 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 1887\n8. Peru State College - 1865\n9. York College - 1890\n\nNow, to find the youngest school, I need to determine which one was founded the latest because \"youngest\" in terms of founding would mean the most recent. The more recent a school is, the younger it is compared to older ones.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Bellevue University was founded in 1966.\n- College of Saint Mary in 1923.\n- Concordia University in 1894.\n- Doane College in 1872.\n- Hastings College in 1882.\n- Midland University in 1883.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University in 1887.\n- Peru State College in 1865.\n- York College in 1890.\n\nComparing these founding years, the highest (most recent) is Bellevue University at 1966. So, it was founded later than all others, making it the youngest among them.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure no other school has a more recent founding date. For example, if another school was founded after 1966, that would change things, but from the table, Bellevue is indeed the latest.\n\nSo, the claim states that in terms of founding date, the youngest school is Bellevue University, which aligns with the data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The claim refers to the founding date, so I need to identify which cells contain this information. In the table, the \"founded\" column is the one that provides each school's founding year. Each row in this column is a different school's founding date, so all rows have relevant information for this check.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions \"the youngest school be Bellevue University.\" So, to verify this, I need to look at the \"founded\" value of Bellevue University (row 0) and confirm it's the latest. But actually, since the claim is about being the youngest, all schools' founding dates are relevant because we're comparing them against each other.\n\nSo, for the purpose of checking if the claim is true, I need to consider the \"founded\" column for every school listed. Therefore, all rows in the table have a relevant cell related to this check.\n\nBut wait, actually, since the claim is about the youngest school, perhaps only the \"founded\" column is relevant because that's what's being compared. So, each row has a \"founded\" value, so each cell in the \"founded\" column is relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all cells are not needed, but just the specific founding year of Bellevue and others to compare. But according to the instructions, I should list all relevant cells that check the claim.\n\nIn this case, the key information is the founding date of each school. So, for the claim to be verified, we need to look at the \"founded\" column for all schools. Thus, all rows have a relevant cell because they contribute to determining which school is the youngest.\n\nBut wait, actually, perhaps only the \"founded\" cells are needed because that's the data point being compared. So, each row's \"founded\" value is relevant because it's part of the comparison.\n\nTherefore, I think all nine rows have a relevant cell in the \"founded\" column, but since the claim is about Bellevue being the youngest, perhaps only the \"founded\" cells for each school are considered. So, each row's \"founded\" value is relevant because it's part of determining which is the youngest.\n\nBut to be precise, the claim is making a statement about the youngest school based on founding date, so all schools' founding dates need to be considered.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table of colleges and universities with various details like their mascots, conferences, national titles, and the year they were founded. The claim is that \"peru state college be the last institution found in the 19th century.\" I need to determine if this is true or false by checking the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Peru State College was the last institution established in the 19th century. So, I need to look at when each school was founded and see their order within that century.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"founded\" column. Let me list out the founded years:\n\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nWait, that's not all. The table shows nine institutions, but I think the claim is about the 19th century, so only those founded between 1801 and 1900 would count.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nNow, I need to see which of these were founded in the 19th century and then determine if Peru State was the last among them.\n\nLooking at their founding years:\n\nPeru State College was founded in 1865, which is within the 19th century. Then Concordia in 1894, York College in 1890, Hastings in 1882, Midland in 1883, Nebraska Wesleyan in 1887, Doane in 1872.\n\nWait, so if I arrange them from earliest to latest in the 19th century:\n\nDoane: 1872\nPeru State: 1865? Wait, no, 1865 is earlier than 1872. So perhaps I got that wrong.\n\nWait, Peru State College was founded in 1865. That's correct because 1865 is before 1872. So the order would be:\n\nPeru State: 1865\nDoane: 1872\nHastings: 1882\nMidland: 1883\nNebraska Wesleyan: 1887\nYork College: 1890\nConcordia: 1894\n\nSo within the 19th century, Peru State was actually one of the earliest institutions founded. The latest among them is Concordia in 1894.\n\nTherefore, Peru State isn't the last institution founded in the 19th century; it's actually one of the earlier ones. So the claim that Peru State College is the last institution found in the 19th century would be false because there are schools after it in the same century, like Concordia in 1894.\n\nI need to make sure I'm considering all relevant cells. The \"founded\" column is crucial here because it tells us when each school was established. So the relevant cells for this check are the rows for Peru State College and any other institution founded in the 19th century, particularly checking if any were after Peru State's founding year.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would include Peru State College's row (row index 8) and also the rows of any institutions that were founded later in the 19th century to show that Peru State isn't the last. Specifically, Concordia University (row index 2) was founded in 1894, which is after Peru State.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 8, column_name: founded\n- row_index: 2, column_name: founded\n\nThese two cells show that Peru State wasn't the last; there's at least one school (Concordia) established later in the same century.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Peru State College was not the last institution founded in the 19th century. Concordia University, for example, was established later.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"only 2 schools, york college and peru state college, have won more than 20 titles.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the 'national titles' column in the table because that's what the claim is referring to. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with bellevue university: their national titles are listed as 14. That's less than 20, so they don't count towards the claim.\n\nNext, college of saint mary has 0 national titles, which is definitely below 20.\n\nConcordia university has 1 title, also not above 20.\n\nDoane college shows 10 national titles\u2014still under 20.\n\nHastings college has 3 titles, so nope.\n\nMidland university with 2 titles doesn't make the cut either.\n\nNebraska wesleyan university has 19 national titles. Hmm, that's close to 20 but not quite there yet. So they don't meet the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nPeru state college is listed with 2 national titles\u2014wait, no, that can't be right. Let me double-check. No, Peru State College actually has 2 national titles? Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"won more than 20 times.\" So if they have 2, that's not more than 20. Did I read it correctly? Let me check the table again. Yes, peru state college has 2 national titles. So they don't meet the threshold either.\n\nLastly, york college is reported to have 28 national titles. That's definitely above 20. \n\nWait a second, the claim says \"only 2 schools, york college and peru state college,\" but from my analysis, only york college meets the condition of having more than 20 titles. Peru State has 2, which isn't over 20. So the claim is incorrect because it's including Peru State as one that meets the criteria when they don't.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"the bellevue bruin be the only nebraska team to play in the midland conference.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The term \"bellevue bruin\" refers to Bellevue University's mascot, which is listed in the table as Bellevue Bruins. The claim states that they are the only Nebraska team in the Midland Conference.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details like mascot, conference, national titles, and founded year.\n\nI need to check if there's any other Nebraska school besides Bellevue University playing in the Midland Conference. So, first, I should look for all schools from Nebraska that are in the Midland Conference.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Bellevue University is in the Midlands conference.\n- College of Saint Mary is also in the Midlands conference.\n- Peru State College is in the Midlands conference.\n\nNow, among these, only Bellevue University is from Nebraska. The other two (College of Saint Mary and Peru State College) are not from Nebraska but perhaps from other states or regions.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if they are indeed from Nebraska. I know that Nebraska Wesleyan University is another school in Nebraska, but it's listed under the Great Plains conference, so it doesn't apply here.\n\nBut in this table, the relevant schools for Nebraska would be:\n\n1. Bellevue University\n2. College of Saint Mary\n3. Peru State College\n\nWait, no, actually, College of Saint Mary and Peru State College are not from Nebraska as far as I know. Let me think again: Bellevue is in Nebraska, but the other two might be from different states.\n\nSo, checking the 'founded' year for each to see if they're based in Nebraska:\n\n- Bellevue University was founded in 1966 and is in Nebraska.\n- College of Saint Mary was founded in 1923; I think it's in Kansas or another state. Similarly, Peru State College was founded in 1865 and is in Peru, Nebraska, but wait, no, Peru State College is actually located in Peru, Illinois. So that might be a confusion.\n\nWait, the table says Peru State College is in the Midlands conference and founded in 1865. I'm a bit confused because there's also Peru State College in Nebraska, but perhaps this one is in another state. For example, there's a Peru State College in Nebraska, which is part of the Midland Conference as well. So maybe both are from Nebraska?\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the 'school' column:\n\n- Bellevue University: Nebraska\n- College of Saint Mary: Probably Kansas or another state, but I'm not sure.\n- Peru State College: The name suggests it's in Peru, which could be either Peru, Illinois or Peru, Nebraska. But given that both are listed in the Midlands conference, maybe there are two schools from Nebraska.\n\nBut wait, the table only lists one Peru State College. So perhaps it's the one in Nebraska.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe claim says \"the Bellevue Bruins be the only Nebraska team to play in the Midland Conference.\" So I need to check if there are any other Nebraska-based schools in the Midlands conference besides Bellevue University.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Bellevue University: mascot = Bellevue Bruins, conference = Midlands\n- College of Saint Mary: mascot = Saint Mary Flames, conference = Midlands\n- Peru State College: mascot = Peru State Bobcats, conference = Midlands\n\nNow, are these three schools all from Nebraska? Let's check their founding years and locations.\n\nBellevue University was founded in 1966, which is a university in Nebraska.\n\nCollege of Saint Mary was founded in 1923. I think that school is actually in Kansas. It\u2019s a Catholic liberal arts college in Salina, KS.\n\nPeru State College was founded in 1865. The name suggests it's from Peru, but there are two: one in Illinois and one in Nebraska. The one in Nebraska is part of the Midland Conference as well. So perhaps the table has two schools from Nebraska in the Midlands conference: Bellevue University and Peru State College.\n\nIf that's the case, then the claim that Bellevue is the only Nebraska team would be false because Peru State College is also from Nebraska and plays in the Midlands.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, I see that Peru State College is listed as part of the Midlands conference. So if both Bellevue University and Peru State College are from Nebraska and play in the Midlands, then the claim is false.\n\nBut let me check each school's location to be sure.\n\nBellevue University: Definitely Nebraska.\n\nCollege of Saint Mary: Located in Salina, Kansas, so not Nebraska.\n\nPeru State College: There are two, but the one in Nebraska would be Peru State College, which is part of the Midland Conference. So yes, it's from Nebraska.\n\nTherefore, there are at least two Nebraska schools (Bellevue and Peru) playing in the Midlands conference. That makes the claim false because it says \"the only Nebraska team,\" implying no others.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: which ones do I need to check? The key points are:\n\n- Which schools are from Nebraska.\n- Which of those are in the Midland Conference.\n\nLooking at the table, rows 0 (Bellevue), row 3 (Doane College not Nebraska), row 4 (Hastings not), row5 (NWU not), row6 (Peru State: is this Nebraska?), row7 (York not).\n\nSo for relevant cells:\n\n- School name: Bellevue University and Peru State College\n- Conference: Midland\n\nAlso, checking if they're from Nebraska.\n\nBut perhaps the 'founded' year could be a clue, but I think it's better to check which schools are actually in Nebraska.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume that all schools listed in the table are US-based, and their conferences can help determine location. Midlands conference includes schools like Bellevue, Saint Mary (possibly KS), Peru State (maybe NE).\n\nBut without exact locations, perhaps we need to rely on the data given. So, from the table:\n\n- Bellevue University: Nebraska\n- College of Saint Mary: Probably Kansas\n- Peru State College: Possibly Nebraska or Illinois.\n\nGiven that both are in Midlands conference and founded earlier, I think Peru State College is indeed from Nebraska.\n\nThus, relevant cells would be:\n\n1. Row 0 (Bellevue) for mascot and conference.\n2. Row 8 (Peru State) for conference.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 0 and row 8.\n\nWait, but in the table, Peru State College is row 7 if we count from 0.\n\nYes, looking back:\n\nRow 0: Bellevue\n...\nRow 6: NWU\nRow7: Peru State\n\nSo row index 7 for Peru State College.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: school name (Bellevue), mascot, conference.\n- Row 7: conference and school name.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the mascot being the only Nebraska team. So perhaps focusing on the schools in Nebraska that play in Midland.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check for all Nebraska schools in Midland.\n\nBut to keep it simple, the key is that there's at least one other Nebraska school (Peru State) in Midland besides Bellevue, making the claim false.\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are:\n\n- Bellevue University: rows 0 for school name, 0 for conference.\n- Peru State College: row7 for school name, row7 for conference.\n\nBut perhaps we need to check if Peru State College's location is Nebraska. If that's uncertain, maybe only rely on the data given.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both are in Midlands conference and founded earlier, but without specific locations, it's tricky.\n\nIn any case, based on the reasoning, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Bellevue Bruins are the sole Nebraska team playing in the Midland Conference is incorrect. There is another Nebraska-based institution, Peru State College, which also competes in the same conference. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- **Claim:** The Bellevue Bruins are the only Nebraska team in the Midland Conference.\n- **Analysis:** There is at least one more Nebraska school (Peru State College) in the Midland Conference besides Bellevue University.\n- **Conclusion:** The claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 0 (Bellevue University) for school name, mascot, and conference.\n- Row 7 (Peru State College) for school name and conference.",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to Saint Mary College. Looking at the table headers, the first column is \"school\". Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University\n2. College of Saint Mary\n3. Concordia University\n4. Doane College\n5. Hastings College\n6. Midland University\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University\n8. Peru State College\n9. York College\n\nSo, the second row is \"College of Saint Mary\". Now, I need to look at the column that has national titles. The relevant column here is \"national titles\".\n\nLooking at the data in the \"national titles\" column:\n\n- Bellevue University: 14\n- College of Saint Mary: 0\n- Concordia University: 1\n- Doane College: 10\n- Hastings College: 3\n- Midland University: 2\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19\n- Peru State College: 2\n- York College: 28\n\nNow, the claim is that Saint Mary holds the highest number of national titles. But from the numbers above, Saint Mary has 0 national titles, which is actually the lowest among all the colleges listed.\n\nI should check if any other college has a higher number than 0. Looking at the list:\n\n- York College has 28, which is the highest.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University has 19.\n- Doane College has 10.\n- Bellevue University has 14.\n- Midland University has 2.\n- Peru State College also has 2.\n\nSo Saint Mary's count of 0 is definitely not the highest.

It claims that Bellevue University was the first college founded in the 20th century. So, I need to check when each school in the table was founded and see if Bellevue was indeed the earliest among them.\n\nLooking at the \"founded\" column in the table:\n\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nI should list these in order to find the earliest.

Then College of Saint Mary in 1923, and Bellevue in 1966.\n\nSo the first college in the 20th century would be the one founded earliest in the 1900s. From the table, the next after 19th century is College of Saint Mary in 1923, then Bellevue in 1966. So none are in the early 1900s, like 1900-1922.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the first college found in the 20th century.\" So which school was founded earliest in the 20th? The table shows that Peru State was founded in 1865 (19th) and the next is Doane in 1872. Then Hastings in 1882, etc., until College of Saint Mary in 1923, then Bellevue in 1966.\n\nSo the first college in the 20th century would be the one with the earliest founded year in 1900 or later. From the table, the next after 19th is 1923 (College of Saint Mary). So Bellevue was founded in 1966, which is later than College of Saint Mary's 1923.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Bellevue University is the first college found in the 20th century is FALSE because College of Saint Mary was founded earlier in 1923.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze each school's founding year.
