Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Matt Wiman in the table. Scanning through the list of fighters, I see that Matt Wiman is one of them. His row has several columns: fights of the night, knockouts of the night, submissions of the night, awards total, and status. \n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"1 submission of the night\" when Matt Wiman is the fighter. So, I need to check the number of submissions Matt Wiman has in a single fight or for the night.\n\nLooking at the table, each fighter's row lists their own submissions for the night. For Matt Wiman, under the \"submissions of the night\" column, it says 1. That matches exactly what the claim is stating: there is one submission when Matt Wiman is the fighter.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The row index for Matt Wiman is row number 19 (since the table starts at row 0, so 19th row). The column in question here is \"submissions of the night,\" which is the third column from the left.\n\nI don't see any other columns or rows that would negate this information. The claim doesn't mention anything about other fighters or additional submissions, just specifically Matt Wiman's submissions for the night. \n\nTherefore, the data fully supports the claim, making it TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"submissions of the night\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Joe Lauzon is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"joe lauzon have 5 fight of the night and 1 knockout of the night.\" My goal is to verify if these numbers match what's in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a fighter with several columns. The relevant columns here are \"fights of the night\" and \"knockouts of the night.\" So, for Joe Lauzon, I need to find his corresponding row and check those two numbers.\n\nI'll start by locating Joe Lauzon's row. Scanning down the table, I see that the first fighter listed is Joe Lauzon. That's row 0 (assuming rows are counted starting from 0). \n\nNext, I check the \"fights of the night\" column for Joe Lauzon. According to the table, it says 5. So that matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the \"knockouts of the night\" column for Joe Lauzon, it's listed as 1. That also aligns with the claim. \n\nSince both numbers in the claim (5 fights and 1 knockout) are accurately reflected in the table, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells that confirm these numbers to ensure the answer is correct. These would be row 0 for \"fights of the night\" and row 0 for \"knockouts of the night.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fights of the night\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"knockouts of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"2 submission of the night occur when the fighter be matt wiman.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part means. The claim is saying that there are exactly two submissions (of the night) attributed to a fighter named Matt Wiman. So I need to check the table for Matt Wiman and see if he has two submission wins.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: fighter, fights of the night, knockouts, submissions, awards total, and status. The relevant column here is \"submissions of the night.\" So I should look for Matt Wiman's row in this specific column.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find Matt Wiman. From the table provided, Matt Wiman has 4 fights, but let me check his submission count. Wait, looking at the \"submissions of the night\" column, Matt Wiman has a value of 1. That means he only has one submission win in the night.\n\nThe claim says there are two submissions when the fighter is Matt Wiman. But according to the table, that's not correct\u2014it's actually one. So the claim must be false because it states a number higher than what's actually present.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify which specific cells in the table support this conclusion. The relevant cell would be the one where the fighter is Matt Wiman and the column is \"submissions of the night.\" In the table, Matt Wiman is at row 21 (assuming rows start from index 0), so his row_index is 20 if starting count from 0, but let me recount.\n\nWait, I should actually count the rows accurately. Let's list out all fighters:\n\n1. joe lauzon\n2. anderson silva\n3. chris lytle\n4. nate diaz\n5. frankie edgar\n6. clay guida\n7. sam stout\n8. wanderlei silva\n9. diego sanchez\n10. forrest griffin\n11. tyson griffin\n12. carlos condit\n13. tito ortiz\n14. joe stevenson\n15. donald cerrone\n16. jon jones\n17. jim miller\n18. chris leben\n19. brad pickett\n20. matt wiman\n21. quinton jackson\n22. marcus davis\n23. georges st - pierre\n24. kenny florian\n25. josh koscheck\n26. melvin guillard\n27. dennis siver\n28. martin kampmann\n29. bj penn\n30. ed herman\n31. roy nelson\n32. lyoto machida\n33. stefan struve\n\nSo Matt Wiman is at row 20, which would make his row index 20 (if we count starting from 0). Therefore, the relevant cell is in row 20, column \"submissions of the night\" with a value of 1.\n\nSince there's only one submission, the claim stating there are two is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"submissions of the night\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"joe lauzon have 4 knockout\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Joe Lauzon in the table.

The columns provided are: fights of the night, knockouts of the night, submissions of the night, awards total, and status.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"knockouts\", so I'm interested in the 'knockouts of the night' column for Joe Lauzon. From the table, under row index 0, Joe Lauzon has 1 knockout listed.\n\nWait a second, the claim says he has 4 knockouts, but according to the table, it's only 1. That seems inconsistent. Maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the table. Yep, it definitely shows 1 knockout for Joe Lauzon.\n\nSo, if the claim states that Joe has 4 knockouts, and the actual number is 1, then the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"joe lauzon have 4 knockout,\" we need to check Joe Lauzon's knockout count in the table.
