The claim says, \"in 1962, the Victorian football league season took place on 23 June.\" \n\nFirst, I should check the table for any entries in 1962 related to Victoria. Looking at the 'date' column, all the dates are \"23 june 1962\". That's consistent across multiple rows. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, looking at the 'home team', there are teams like Essendon, Collingwood, Melbourne, etc., which I know are Victorian clubs. The 'away team' also includes Victorian teams such as Richmond and Hawthorn in some cases. So all matches on 23 June 1962 were part of the Victorian Football League season.\n\nThe venue column shows places like mcg, windy hill, Victoria Park, etc., but regardless of the venue, they are all part of Victorian competitions.\n\nSo, all relevant cells would be each row where the date is \"23 june 1962\". Each row has a home and away team, so those columns are relevant. The 'date' column is also relevant because it directly shows that the matches were on 23 June 1962 in 1962.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the game between footscray and carlton be play at princess park.\" \n\nFirst, let me look through each row of the table to find matches for both teams in the claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n1. melbourne vs st kilda\n2. essendon vs geelong\n3. collingwood vs fitzroy\n4. carlton vs footscray\n5. south melbourne vs richmond\n6. north melbourne vs hawthorn\n\nI see that row 4 is \"carlton\" playing against \"footscray.\" So, the game between these two teams is indeed in the table.\n\nNow, I need to check where this game was played. The venue for this particular match is \"princes park.\" Wait, the claim says \"princess park,\" but the venue listed is \"princes park.\" There's a slight difference in spelling: one has an 'i' and the other has no 'i.' \n\nI should verify if these are considered different venues. In English, \"princes\" without an 'i' might be incorrect, so it's likely that \"princess park\" is a misspelling. Therefore, the claim might be referring to the wrong venue.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if \"princess park\" and \"princes park\" are actually different places or if one is a typo of the other. If they are indeed the same place, then the claim would still be correct, even with the spelling mistake. However, I think it's more probable that \"princes park\" is the correct name, so the claim's venue might be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since the claim specifies \"princess park,\" which doesn't match any venue in the table (it matches \"princes park\"), the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, another angle: maybe the user made a typo. If I consider that the claim intended to say \"princes park\" and not \"princess park,\" then it would be correct because the venue listed is \"princes park.\" But as per the given data, the venue is spelled without an 'i,' so \"princes park.\"\n\nSo, the user's claim has a typo in the venue name. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are where carlton and footscray play each other.\n</think>\n\nThe game between Footscray and Carlton is indeed listed at Princes Park.

My task is to find the crowd numbers for both matches mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with the first match: South Melbourne vs Richmond. Scanning down the rows, I see that South Melbourne is the home team in row 5. Their crowd number is 17,000 according to the table.\n\nNext, the second match: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne. Hawthorn is listed as the away team in row 6, but actually, looking closer, the home teams are other clubs like Melbourne, Essendon, Collingwood, etc., so I need to find where Hawthorn and North Melbourne are playing each other.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: Melbourne vs St Kilda\nRow 1: Essendon vs Geelong\nRow 2: Collingwood vs Fitzroy\nRow 3: Carlton vs Footscray\nRow 4: South Melbourne vs Richmond\nRow 5: North Melbourne vs Hawthorn\n\nWait, no. Wait, the \"away team\" column shows for each row who is playing away. So in Row 5, the home team is North Melbourne, and the away team is Hawthorn.\n\nSo that's the game between Hawthorn and North Melbourne. Their crowd number is 8,470 according to the table.\n\nComparing the two crowds: South Melbourne vs Richmond had 17,000 attendees, while Hawthorn vs North Melbourne had only 8,470. So 17,000 is indeed bigger than 8,470.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for this comparison are \"crowd,\" and specifically the rows where South Melbourne vs Richmond (row 5) and Hawthorn vs North Melbourne (row 6). Wait, no, row indices start at 0. So row 4 is South Melbourne vs Richmond, and row 5 is North Melbourne vs Hawthorn.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: melbourne, ..., crowd 48952\nRow 1: essendon, ..., 35000\nRow 2: collingwood, ..., 26488\nRow 3: carlton, ..., 32400\nRow 4: south melbourne vs richmond, crowd 17000\nRow 5: north melbourne vs hawthorn, crowd 8470\n\nSo row 4 is South Melbourne vs Richmond, and row 5 is North Melbourne vs Hawthorn.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in column \"crowd\" for rows 4 and 5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, I need to compare the crowd numbers for the two matches specified. \n\n1. **South Melbourne vs Richmond**: The crowd is listed as 17,000.\n2. **Hawthorn vs North Melbourne**: The crowd is listed as 8,470.\n\nSince 17,000 is greater than 8,470, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the \"crowd\" data for both matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The home teams listed are Melbourne, Essendon, Collingwood, Carlton, South Melbourne, and North Melbourne. That's six different home teams.\n\nNow, let's look at the away teams. The away teams are St Kilda, Geelong, Fitzroy, Footscray, Richmond, and Hawthorn. That's another six unique away teams.\n\nSince each game involves both a home and an away team, but they're all distinct from each other except for when it's listed as home or away. Wait, no, in this table, each row is a separate match, so the home and away teams are paired against each other. So for example, Melbourne vs St Kilda, Essendon vs Geelong, etc.\n\nSo combining both home and away teams: Melbourne, Essendon, Collingwood, Carlton, South Melbourne, North Melbourne, St Kilda, Geelong, Fitzroy, Footscray, Richmond, Hawthorn. That's 12 unique teams in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The table has six matches, each with a home and an away team. So that would mean 6 home teams and 6 away teams, potentially overlapping or not. But looking at the list: Melbourne is home, St Kilda is away; Essendon is home, Geelong is away; Collingwood vs Fitzroy; Carlton vs Footscray; South Melbourne vs Richmond; North Melbourne vs Hawthorn.\n\nSo the unique teams across all matches are:\n\nHome: Melbourne, Essendon, Collingwood, Carlton, South Melbourne, North Melbourne (6)\nAway: St Kilda, Geelong, Fitzroy, Footscray, Richmond, Hawthorn (6)\n\nTotal unique teams = 12.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"collingwood score more points than fitzroy in their 1962 VFL match.\" So, I need to check if Collingwood's score was higher than Fitzroy's in that particular match from 1962.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I can see it lists several matches. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match on June 23, 1962.\n\nI need to locate Collingwood and Fitzroy in the table. Scanning through the home teams, I find Collingwood as the third entry (row index 2) and Fitzroy as the fourth entry (row index 3). Wait, no, actually, looking again: the first row is Melbourne vs St Kilda, second is Essendon vs Geelong, third is Collingwood vs Fitzroy, then Carlton vs Footscray, South Melbourne vs Richmond, and North Melbourne vs Hawthorn. So yes, Collingwood is home team in row 2 (index starting from 0) and Fitzroy is the away team in that same match.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be for the Collingwood's score and Fitzroy's score. For Collingwood, the column is \"home team score,\" which is 74 points. For Fitzroy, since they are the away team, their score is under \"away team score,\" which is 65 points.\n\nComparing these two scores: 74 (Collingwood) vs 65 (Fitzroy). Since 74 is greater than 65, the claim holds true.\n\nI also need to make sure that all conditions of the claim are met. The match was in 1962, and according to the table, the date is June 23, 1962, so that's correct.

Melbourne vs St Kilda at McG: Not relevant.\n2. Essendon vs Geelong at Windy Hill: Home team is Essendon, so not the game in question.\n3.

Wait, no, wait: The claim is about South Melbourne vs Richmond, which has a crowd of 17000.

So the claim says South Melbourne vs Richmond drew the smallest crowd. However, their crowd was 17k, which isn't the smallest. The actual smallest was 8470.

The smallest was north melbourne's game with 8470 people.

Wait, the away team here is Fitzroy, so Hawthorn isn't playing against Collingwood in this row.\n4. Row 3: Home team - Carlton, away team - Footscray. No relevance.\n5. Row 4: Home team - South Melbourne, away team - Richmond. Not relevant.\n6. Row 5: Home team - North Melbourne, away team - Hawthorn. Ah, here we go. The home team is North Melbourne, and the away team is Hawthorn.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Collingwood scoring more than Hawthorn. So I need to find a match where both teams are involved, specifically when Collingwood is playing against Hawthorn in 1962.\n\nLooking back at row 5, it's between North Melbourne and Hawthorn. Collingwood isn't playing here. So perhaps the match I'm looking for isn't in this table? Or maybe I missed a row where both teams are present.\n\nWait, let me check each row again:\n\nRow 0: Melbourne vs St Kilda\nRow1: Essendon vs Geelong\nRow2: Collingwood vs Fitzroy\nRow3: Carlton vs Footscray\nRow4: South Melbourne vs Richmond\nRow5: North Melbourne vs Hawthorn\n\nI don't see a match between Collingwood and Hawthorn in this table. So maybe the claim is based on a different match not listed here, but given that the date is 23 June 1962 and all rows have the same date, perhaps it's within these matches.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if there's any row where both Collingwood and Hawthorn are playing each other. But in this table, I don't see such a row. So perhaps the claim is false because either:\n\n- There's no match between Collingwood and Hawthorn on that date as per the table.\nOr\n- The scores aren't in favor of Collingwood if there was such a match.\n\nBut since the table doesn't show any match between them, maybe the claim is incorrect. However, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rows. Let me double-check each row's away team to see if Hawthorn is involved elsewhere.\n\nRow0: St Kilda\nRow1: Geelong\nRow2: Fitzroy\nRow3: Footscray\nRow4: Richmond\nRow5: Hawthorn\n\nSo only row5 has Hawthorn as the away team. But in that match, Collingwood isn't playing; it's North Melbourne vs Hawthorn.\n\nTherefore, there's no direct comparison between Collingwood and Hawthorn in this table. So either the claim is based on a different match not listed here, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to the same date but a different match where both teams are playing. But in the given data, only one match per row, so perhaps Collingwood isn't playing Hawthorn at all in this dataset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is considering that Collingwood's score against other teams includes more points than Hawthorn's maximum or something else, but that doesn't make sense because the claim specifically says \"in the 1962 VFL match,\" implying a direct comparison.\n\nSo, since there's no row where both Collingwood and Hawthorn are playing each other in this table, I might have to conclude that the claim is false because such a match isn't present. Alternatively, if there's another interpretation, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is looking at when Hawthorn was the home team against Collingwood, but that would require checking for a row where Hawthorn is the away team and Collingwood is the home team or vice versa.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow2: Collingwood (home) vs Fitzroy (away). So if Hawthorn isn't playing here, then perhaps in another match.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each team's matches. For example, looking at Collingwood's matches on 23 June 1962: they are the home team against Fitzroy.\n\nHawthorn's match is as the away team against North Melbourne. So there's no match between them.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is false because in the given table, there's no match where both Collingwood and Hawthorn played each other on that date. Therefore, the score comparison can't be made based on this data, leading to the claim being false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if any of the matches have both teams involved in some way. No, each match is between two specific teams, and none of them are Collingwood vs Hawthorn.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be those where both teams are present, but since they aren't, perhaps the claim is false because there's no data supporting it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood scored more points than Hawthorn in the 1962 VFL match. Upon examining the table, Collingwood plays Fitzroy, while Hawthorn plays North Melbourne on that date. There is no direct match between Collingwood and Hawthorn, so the score comparison cannot be verified from the provided data.\n\nAnswer: \"FALSE\"\n\nRelevant cells: None, as there's no relevant match between the two teams to verify their scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
