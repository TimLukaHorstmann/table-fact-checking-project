    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with data from 2000 to 2010, and a claim to verify. Let me break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the net profit / loss (sek) 2273000000 have employee (average / year) larger than 18786 , a year end of 2000 , and passenger flown larger than 23239000.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of the claim.\n\n1. Net profit/loss in 2000 is 2,273,000,000 sek.\nLooking at the table, under 'net profit / loss (sek)', for the year ended 2000, it's indeed 2,273,000,000. So that condition checks out.\n\n2. Employees (average/year) larger than 18,786 in 2000.\nIn 2000, employees are listed as 30,939. That's much higher than 18,786. So this also holds true.\n\n3. Passengers flown in 2000 larger than 23,239,000.\nWait, the claim says \"larger than 23239000\". But looking at the table, for 2000, passengers flown are 23,240,000. Hmm, but wait, does it say 'larger than' or 'equal to'? The claim uses a comma, which might be a decimal separator in some countries, but in this context, it's probably a thousand separator. So 23239000 would mean 23,239,000. But the actual value is 23,240,000, which is larger. So that condition is also true.\n\nPutting it all together, all three conditions are met based on the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with all specified conditions being true for the year 2000 as per the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"employees (average / year)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"passengers flown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the net profit / loss - 1140000000 have a basic eps (sek) of -6.58 , and employee (average / year) larger than 31034\".\n\nI'll break this down into two main parts to verify:\n\n1. **Net Profit/Loss of -114,000,000 has Basic EPS of -6.58**\n2. **Employee average/year is larger than 31,034**\n\nStarting with the first part: I need to find a row in the table where net profit/loss is exactly -1,140,000,000 and basic eps is -6.58.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, from 2000 to 2010. The columns relevant here are \"net profit / loss (sek)\" and \"basic eps (sek)\".\n\nI'll scan through each row:\n\n- **2001**: net profit/loss is -1,140,000,000 and basic eps is -6.58.\nYes, that's exactly the values mentioned in the claim. So this part checks out.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: employee average/year must be larger than 31,034.\n\nAgain, I'll look for a row where the \"employees (average / year)\" column has a value greater than 31,034.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **2000**: 30,939 \u2192 Not larger\n- **1999**: 30,310 \u2192 Not larger\n- **2001**: 31,035 \u2192 Wait, this is just above 31,034. So 31,035 is indeed larger than 31,034.\n\nWait a second, but the claim says \"employee ... larger than 31034.\" So does 31,035 count as larger? Yes, because 31,035 > 31,034.\n\nHowever, I should check if this employee number corresponds to the same row as the net profit/loss. In 2001, both conditions are met: net profit is -114,000,000 and eps is -6.58, and employees are 31,035 which is larger than 31,034.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a different year where employees exceed 31,034 and the net profit is -1,140,000,000. But in that case, I need both conditions to be true for the same row.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **2002**: employees are 35,506 (much higher)\nBut net profit is -736,000,000 and eps is -0.81. So no.\n- **2003**: employees 34,544; but net profit is -2,221,000,000, eps -8.60\nNot matching.\n- **2004**: employees 32,481; net profit -1,813,000,000, eps -11.38\nNope.\n- **2005**: employees 32,363; net profit 418,000,000, eps 1.06\nNo match.\n- **2006**: employees 26,554; net profit 4,936,000,000, eps 28.10\nNot matching.\n- **2007**: employees 26,538; net profit 1,234,000,000, eps 3.87\nNo.\n- **2008**: employees 24,635; net profit -636,000,000, eps -6.29\nNope.\n- **2009**: employees 18,786; net profit -2,947,000,000, eps -18.20\nNo.\n- **2010**: employees 14,801; net profit -2,218,000,000, eps -7.79\nNot applicable.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that in 2001, employees are 31,035 which is just over 31,034 and the net profit is indeed -114,000,000 with eps -6.58.\n\nSo both conditions are met in the same row (2001), meaning the claim is TRUE because all stated facts align with a specific data point.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because both conditions are satisfied in the 2001 row of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"basic eps (sek)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"When the net profit / loss (sek) is larger than 4935000000, and a basic eps (sek) larger than 1.06, then the number of employees (average/year) is larger than 4.\"\n\nSo, to verify this claim, I need to check if every time both conditions are met\u2014net profit/loss exceeding 4,935,000,000 sek and basic EPS greater than 1.06\u2014the average number of employees per year is indeed larger than 4.\n\nLet me look at the table provided. Each row represents a different year from 2000 to 2010. The relevant columns are:\n\n- net profit / loss (sek)\n- basic eps (sek)\n- employees (average/year)\n\nI'll go through each year and check if both conditions are true for that year, then see if the number of employees is more than 4.\n\nStarting from 2000:\n\n2000: net profit is 2,273,000,000. That's less than 4,935,000,000, so condition not met. Employees are 23,240,000, which is way over 4, but since the first condition isn't met, it doesn't matter.\n\n1999: net profit is 1,846,000,000, still below 4,935 million. Employees are 21,991,000\u2014way above 4, but again, condition not met.\n\n2000 onwards:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the years from 2000 to 2010, I need to check each one for net profit/loss and basic eps.\n\nLet me list out all the relevant data points:\n\nYear | Net Profit/Loss (sek) | Basic EPS (sek) | Employees (avg/year)\n-----|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------\n2000 | 2,273,000,000        | 11.79            | 23,240,000\n1999 | 1,846,000,000        | 8.41             | 21,991,000\n2004 | -1,813,000,000       | -11.38           | 32,400,000\n2005 | 418,000,000          | 1.06             | 36,312,000\n2006 | 4,936,000,000        | 28.10            | 38,609,000\n2007 | 1,234,000,000        | 3.87             | 29,200,000\n2008 | -636,000,000         | -6.29            | 24,635\n2009 | -2,947,000,000       | -18.20           | 18,786\n2010 | -2,218,000,000       | -7.79            | 14,801\n\nWait, but the table in markdown starts from 2001 to 2010. Let me correct that:\n\nLooking back, the table starts from 1999 to 2010.\n\nSo, for each year, check if Net Profit/Loss > 4,935,000,000 and Basic EPS > 1.06.\n\nFirst, let's find which rows meet both conditions.\n\nNet profit/loss exceeding 4,935,000,000: Looking at the table:\n\n- 2006: 4,936,000,000 (exceeds)\n- 1999: 1,846 million, no\n- 2000: 2,273 million, no\n- 2005: 418 million, no\n- 2007: 1,234 million, no\n- 2008: negative, no\n- 2004: negative, no\n- 2009: negative, no\n- 2010: negative, no\n\nSo only 2006 meets Net Profit/Loss >4.935B.\n\nNow, for that year, check Basic EPS:\n\n2006's Basic EPS is 28.10, which is greater than 1.06. So both conditions are met.\n\nEmployees in 2006: 38,609,000, which is way more than 4.\n\nSo, in this case, the claim holds true for this year.\n\nAre there any other rows where Net Profit/Loss exceeds 4,935 million and Basic EPS >1.06?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- 1999: Net profit 1.846B, no\n- 2000: 2.273B, no\n- 2005: 418M, no\n- 2006: yes\n- Others either don't meet the net profit or have negative.\n\nSo only 2006 meets both conditions. In that case, employees are 38,609,000, which is way over 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold true because whenever both conditions are met (which happens in 2006), the number of employees is indeed larger than 4.\n\nWait, but I should check all years where Net Profit/Loss >4.935B and Basic EPS>1.06. So only 2006. And in that case, employees are 38 million+, which is definitely over 4.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other years. For example, 1999's net profit is 1.846B, which is less than 4.935B. 2000:2.273B, still under. 2005:418M, no. 2006:4.936B, yes. 2007:1.234B, no. 2008: -636M, no. Etc.\n\nSo only 2006 meets both conditions. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because in that year, employees are way over 4 when both conditions are met.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there's any row where Net Profit/Loss >4.935B and Basic EPS>1.06 but Employees <=4. But since only 2006 meets those two conditions, and it has 38 million+ employees, the claim holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking each year for both net profit/loss exceeding 4,935,000,000 sek and basic EPS exceeding 1.06. Only 2006 satisfies these conditions, and its employee count is significantly higher than 4, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": 5,\n      \"col\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"for the year between 2009 and 2007 , have a basic eps (sek) of -6.58 , and employee (average / year) larger than 31035.\"\n\nWait, that wording is a bit confusing. It says \"between 2009 and 2007.\" Hmm, but 2009 is after 2007, so the years in question are from 2007 to 2009. Or does it mean the period starting from 2009 going back to 2007? I think it's referring to the years 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n\nSo, for these three years (2007, 2008, 2009), we need two things:\n\n1. The basic eps (sek) is -6.58.\n2. The employee average/year is larger than 31035.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a specific year. Let me check each of these years one by one.\n\nStarting with 2007: From the table, in the \"basic eps (sek)\" column, it's 3.87. That's not -6.58, so this doesn't fit. Also, employees for 2007 are 26538, which is less than 31035. So 2007 fails both conditions.\n\nNext, 2008: Basic eps is -6.29. Not the required -6.58. Employees are 24635, still below 31035. So 2008 also doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nNow, 2009: Basic eps is -18.20. Again, not -6.58. Employees for 2009 are 18786, which is less than 31035. So 2009 doesn't fit either.\n\nWait a second, none of the years from 2007 to 2009 have a basic eps of -6.58 and employee count over 31035. Let me double-check each year again to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLooking at 2001: Basic eps is -6.58. Employees for 2001 are 31035. That's exactly the number mentioned in the claim. So 2001 fits both conditions.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"between 2009 and 2007.\" Does it include 2001? Or am I misinterpreting the time frame?\n\nThe claim says \"for the year between 2009 and 2007,\" which might mean any of those years. So if 2001 is outside that range, does that matter? Or perhaps the wording is incorrect, and they meant from 2007 to 2009.\n\nAssuming it's a typo or misstatement, but regardless, the key point is whether in the specified years (2007-2009), there exists a year where both conditions are met. Since none of those three years fit, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if \"between 2009 and 2007\" includes all years between them, including 2001, then 2001 is part of that range? No, because 2001 comes before 2007, so it's not in between. So, maybe the claim intended a different set of years.\n\nBut regardless, based on the data, none of the specified years meet both criteria. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because none of the years from 2007 to 2009 have both a basic eps (sek) of -6.58 and an employee average/year exceeding 31035.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"basic eps (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"employees (average / year)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the company report over 23240000 passenger flown in the year 2000 and a net profit / loss of -1813000000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. **Passengers flown in 2000:** The claim states that the number of passengers flown was over 23,240,000. Looking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific year. For 2000, the \"passengers flown\" column shows 23,240,00. Wait, but the claim says \"over\" 23,240,000. The exact number in the table is 23,240,00, which is actually 23,240,000 when considering the comma as a thousand separator. So does that mean it's exactly 23,240,000 or more? The table shows 23,240,000, not over. But sometimes, \"over\" might be interpreted as greater than or equal to. So I need to check if in the table, 2000 has at least 23,240,000 passengers.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- 2000: 23,240,000\nSo it's exactly that number, not over. But sometimes, \"over\" could be used to mean equal or more. However, strictly speaking, \"over\" usually implies exceeding. If the exact number is in the table, then \"over\" might not be accurate. So perhaps this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\n2. **Net profit/loss in 2000:** The claim mentions a net loss of -1,813,000,000. Looking at the \"net profit / loss (sek)\" column for 2000, it shows -1,813,000,000. So that part matches exactly.\n\nNow, putting both parts together: The claim says both that passengers were over 23 million and had a net loss of about -1.8 billion. From the table, passengers in 2000 are exactly 23,240,000, so if \"over\" is taken as strictly more than, it's not accurate because the number isn't higher; it's equal. However, sometimes \"over\" might be used to include the exact figure, but it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe net profit/loss part matches exactly. So one part is correct, and the other might depend on interpretation. But since the claim uses \"over,\" which implies more than 23 million, which isn't the case here, this would make the overall claim incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each part against the table.\n\n- **Passengers flown in 2000:** The table shows exactly 23,240,000 passengers, not over. Therefore, the claim's use of \"over\" is incorrect unless it includes the exact number.\n- **Net profit/loss in 2000:** This matches the table exactly.\n\nSince one part doesn't fully support the claim, the overall answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"passengers flown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the company was more profitable in 2005 than 2006, with a net profit of 4936000000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: profitability and net profit amount.\n\nStarting with profitability, the term suggests that 2005 had higher profits compared to 2006. To verify this, I need to look at the \"net profit / loss (sek)\" column for both years 2005 and 2006.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- In 2005, under \"net profit / loss\", it's 418000000.\n- In 2006, it's 4936000000.\n\nSo comparing these numbers: 418 million vs. 4.936 billion. Clearly, 2006 had a much higher net profit than 2005. Therefore, the company was not more profitable in 2005 compared to 2006; in fact, it was less profitable.\n\nNext, checking the exact net profit figure for 2005. The claim specifies 4,936,000,000 sek (which is written as 4936000000 in the table). Looking at the table, under 2005, \"net profit / loss\" is indeed 418000000, not 4936000000. Wait a minute\u2014that doesn't match.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: the claim says net profit of 4,936,000,000 for 2006? No, wait, no\u2014the claim says the company was more profitable in 2005 than 2006 with that net profit. But according to the table, 2006 has a much higher net profit. So the net profit figure given in the claim is actually for 2006.\n\nWait, but the claim states \"with a net profit of 4936000000,\" which matches exactly the 2006 row's net profit. But since 2005 was less profitable than 2006, that part of the claim is incorrect as well.\n\nSo both points in the claim are false: the company wasn't more profitable in 2005 compared to 2006, and the net profit given in the claim doesn't match 2005's actual figure. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
