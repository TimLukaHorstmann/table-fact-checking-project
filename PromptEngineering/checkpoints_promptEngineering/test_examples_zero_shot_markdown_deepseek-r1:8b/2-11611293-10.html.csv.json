    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"lj burger be a player on 19 - 2 - 2003\". \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. It has several columns: catches, player, versus, venue, and date. My task is to check if there's any row where the player is \"lj burger\" and the date matches \"19 - 2 - 2003\".\n\nLooking at each row one by one:\n\n- The first row has a player named \"m kaif\", so that's not lj burger.\n- Second row: \"v sehwag\", nope.\n- Third row: \"lj burger\". Oh, this is the player we're looking for. Now check the date column. It says \"19 - 02 - 2003\". Wait, in the claim it's written as \"19 - 2 - 2003\". Does that matter? I think the format might be different but if we consider that \"19-02\" is the same as \"19-2\", then the date matches. So this row has both player and date matching.\n- Fourth row: \"jp maher\", nope.\n- Fifth: \"hh dippenaar\", nope.\n- Sixth: \"d mongia\", nope.\n- Seventh: \"v sehwag\" again, not what we need.\n- Eighth: \"af giles\", no.\n\nSo the third row is the one where player is \"lj burger\" and date is \"19 - 02 - 2003\". But wait, in the claim it's written as \"19 - 2 - 2003\". The table uses \"19 - 02 - 2003\". So are those considered different? Because in some formats, \"2\" and \"02\" could be interpreted differently, but in this case, I think they're just formatting differences. Both refer to the same date: February 19th, 2003. So yes, it matches.\n\nTherefore, there is a matching row that supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the third row where \"lj burger\" is the player and the date matches February 19, 2003.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"m kaif have 4 catch vs sri lanka\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim has three parts: m kaif, catches (which is a number), and versus sri lanka. So I think it's saying that m kaif caught 4 dismissals against Sri Lanka.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: catches, player, versus, venue, date. I'll need to check if there's an entry where the player is \"m kaif\", the number of catches is 4, and the opponent (versus column) is Sri Lanka.\n\nI should go through each row in the table and see which ones match these criteria. Let me start by scanning each row for the player named \"m kaif\".\n\nRow 0: Player is m kaif. Versus is Sri Lanka. Catches are 4. That matches exactly what the claim says. So this row is relevant.\n\nRows 1-7 don't have m kaif as the player, so I can ignore those.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant cell is in row 0 (since it's the first row) and the column is catches. So the answer should be TRUE because there is a match, and FALSE otherwise if no such entry exists.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a matching entry in the table where m kaif caught 4 dismissals against Sri Lanka.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"catches\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"jp maher have a date of 19 - 02 - 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions \"jp maher\" and a specific date, \"19 - 02 - 2003.\" My task is to check if there's an entry in the table that matches both the player name and the date.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has columns for catches, player, versus, venue, and date. I need to find the row where the player is \"jp maher\" and the date is \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Player is m kaif, not jp maher.\n- Row 1: Player is v sehwag, nope.\n- Row 2: Player is lj burger, no match.\n- Row 3: Player is jp maher. Wait, that's the one. Now check the date for this row. The date is \"19 - 02 - 2003.\" That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo, there is a row where both conditions are met: player is jp maher and date is 19 - 02 - 2003. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to note which cells in the table support this. The relevant cells would be the one at row_index 3 for the player column and row_index 3 for the date column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a specific entry in the table where \"jp maher\" plays on \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
