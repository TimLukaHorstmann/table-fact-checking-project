    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"there be 10.6 million viewers for episode part four that have a run time of 24:57.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's in markdown format with columns: episode, broadcast date, run time, viewers (in millions), and archive. Each row represents a different part of the show.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific attributes for \"episode part four\": viewers and runtime. So, I need to check these two columns for the corresponding row.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Part four is the fourth row, so row index 3.\n- The viewers column for part four shows 10.6 million viewers.\n- The run time column for part four is 24:57.\n\nBoth of these attributes match exactly what's stated in the claim. Therefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones in row index 3 for both \"viewers\" and \"run time.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the viewers and runtime columns for part four in the table. Both values match the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
