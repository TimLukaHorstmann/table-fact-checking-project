    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"xu huaiwen play in the women's single from 2003 to 2006.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of this claim means. It seems like it's saying that Xu Huaiwen participated as a woman's singles player from the years 2003 through 2006. So I should check if there are entries for Xu Huaiwen in the women's singles column for those specific years.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"year,\" \"women 's singles.\" The rows go from 1988 up to 2013. \n\nI'll start by looking at each year from 2003 to 2006 and see if Xu Huaiwen is listed in the women's singles column for those years.\n\nStarting with 2003:\n- Year: 2003\n- Women 's singles: xu huaiwen\n\nThat's a match. So Xu Huaiwen was indeed a women's singles participant in 2003.\n\nNext, 2004:\n- Year: 2004\n- Women 's singles: xu huaiwen\n\nAgain, Xu Huaiwen is listed here. So she participated in 2004 as well.\n\nMoving on to 2005:\n- Year: 2005\n- Women 's singles: xu huaiwen\n\nShe's also there for 2005. So that's three years so far.\n\nNow, 2006:\n- Year: 2006\n- Women 's singles: xu huaiwen\n\nXu Huaiwen is present here too. That makes it four years from 2003 to 2006.\n\nSo, Xu Huaiwen played in the women's singles for each of those years.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"helle nielsen marie roepke play together in the women's double 2 year in a row.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim means. It seems to suggest that Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke were partners in women's doubles for two consecutive years. So, I need to look into the table to see if both players appear together in the same women's doubles cell for two different years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1988 onwards. The columns are: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles, as well as mixed doubles. \n\nI'll focus on the women's doubles column since the claim is about that. Now, I need to check if Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke appear together in two consecutive years.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows have both players listed in the women's doubles column.\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n- 2009: The women's doubles pair is \"helle nielsen marie roepke\". So that's one instance.\n- Next, checking if they are together again in the following years. But in the table provided, the next rows after 2009 don't show both Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke. For example, 2010 has \"pan pan tian qing\", which doesn't include them. Similarly, for other years like 2011, 2012, etc., their names don't appear together again in the same cell.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a row. Let me go through each year systematically:\n\n1988: No\n1989: No\n1990: Not listed, assuming it's not there.\n1998: No\n1999: No\n2000: No\n2001: No\n2002: No\n2003: No\n2004: No\n2005: No\n2006: No\n2007: No\n2008: No\n2009: Yes, Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke together.\n2010: No\n2011: No\n2012: No\n2013: No\n\nSo, only in 2009 are they together. The next year after that is 2010, but they're not listed there. Therefore, it seems they only played together once, not two years in a row.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's another instance where they play together. Let me look again:\n\nIn the women's doubles column for 2009: Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke.\nIs there another entry where these two are paired? For example, in 2010, it's \"pan pan tian qing\", which doesn't include them. 2011 has \"mizuki fujii reika kakiiwa\". No. 2012: \"wang rong zhang zhibo\". Not them.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they played together for two consecutive years is not supported by the table because they only appear together once in 2009 and nowhere else in consecutive years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"michael s\u00f8gaard play in the men 's double with both joachim fischer nielsen and michael lamp.\" So, I need to check if Michael S\u00f8gaard was part of the men's doubles team in any given year along with Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different year from 1988 onwards. The columns for men's doubles are under \"men 's doubles\" (though I notice there's an apostrophe in the column name, but that shouldn't affect the search). Each cell under this column lists the players for that particular year.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's \"men 's doubles\" cell to see if Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp. Let me go through each year one by one.\n\n1988: The men's doubles are Mark & Robert. No match.\n1989: Stefan Frey & Robert Neumann. Not our trio.\n1998: Michael Keck & Christian Mohr. No.\n1999: Quinten van Dalm & Dennis Lens. No.\n2000: Michael S\u00f8gaard with Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp? Wait, in 2000, the men's doubles are Michael S\u00f8gaard paired with Joachim Fischer Nielsen. But wait, is Michael Lamp mentioned here? Let me check.\n\nWait, in 2000, the cell says \"michael s\u00f8gaard joachim fischer nielsen\". So, it's just two names: Michael S\u00f8gaard and Joachim Fischer Nielsen. Michael Lamp isn't listed here, so this isn't a trio with all three mentioned.\n\nNext years:\n2001: Michael S\u00f8gaard paired with Michael Lamp. Here, the men's doubles are Michael S\u00f8gaard and Michael Lamp. So, that's two of them, but no Joachim Fischer Nielsen.\nWait, in 2001, it's \"michael s\u00f8gaard michael lamp\". So, only those two. No Joachim here.\n\n2002: Simon Archer & Flandy Limpele. Not relevant.\n\n2003: Micha\u0142 \u0141ogosz & Robert Mateusiak. Nope.\n\n2004: Simon Archer & Anthony Clark. No.\n\n2005: Tony Gunawan & Halim Haryanto. No.\n\n2006: Micha\u0142 \u0141ogosz & Robert Mateusiak. Same as 2003.\n\n2007: Mathias Boe & Carsten Mogensen. Not our trio.\n\n2008: Mathias Boe & Carsten Mogensen again. No.\n\n2009: Rupesh Kumar & Sanave Thomas. No.\n\n2010: Mathias Boe & Carsten Mogensen. Same as before.\n\n2011: Bodin Isara & Maneepong Jongjit. Not relevant.\n\n2012: Ingo Kindervater & Johannes Schoettler. No.\n\n2013: Michael Fuchs & Birgit Michels. No.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go back to 2000 again. It says \"michael s\u00f8gaard joachim fischer nielsen\". So only two people here. But the claim is about all three: Michael S\u00f8gaard with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp.\n\nLooking through all the years, in 2001, Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with Michael Lamp, but not Joachim. In 2000, he's with Joachim, but not Michael Lamp. So there isn't a year where all three are listed together.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no row where Michael S\u00f8gaard plays men's doubles with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp on the same team in any given year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Michael S\u00f8gaard played men's doubles with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp. By checking each year's men's doubles entries, none of the rows list all three players together.

It seems like it's saying that both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan each won the women's singles twice.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the \"women 's singles\" column to find their entries across different years.\n\nStarting with Katrin Schmidt: Scanning down the list, in 1988 she won. Then in 2003, I see her again under the same column. So that's two wins for her.\n\nNow checking Pi Hongyan: In 2002 and 2011, her name appears in the women's singles column. That means she also has two wins.\n\nSo both players have indeed won twice each in the women's singles category. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"katrin schmidt and pi hongyan both play 2 time in the women 's single,\" I need to check their participation across different years.\n\n1. **Katrin Schmidt**:\n   - 1988: Winner\n   - 2003: Winner\n   Total wins: 2\n\n2. **Pi Hongyan**:\n   - 2002: Winner\n   - 2011: Winner\n   Total wins: 2\n\nSince both players have won the women's singles twice, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the mixed double.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three players: katrin schmidt, markus keck, and chen jin. They are all involved in the mixed doubles event.\n\nLooking at the table, each year has entries for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The relevant column here is \"mixed doubles.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to find where katrin schmidt appears in the mixed doubles column. \n\nStarting from 1988: Katrin Schmidt is listed as part of markus keck katrin schmidt. So that's one instance.\n\nNext, in 1989, the mixed doubles are chen jin katrin schmidt. So both markus and chen are paired with her? Wait, no. In 1989, it's chen jin and katrin Schmidt. So here, she's playing with chen jin. But where is markus keck in that year?\n\nLooking at men's singles for 1989: It's s\u00f6rgard, not markus. Men's doubles is stefan frey robert neumann, so markus isn't there either. Women's singles is katrin Schmidt again. So in mixed doubles of 1989, she's with chen jin.\n\nIn 1998, the mixed doubles are michael keck nicol pitro. Not relevant for our claim.\n\nContinuing until I find a year where katrin Schmidt is playing with both markus and chen in mixed doubles.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for specific years where both markus and chen are partners with her in different rows. But each row only shows one pair for mixed doubles.\n\nAlternatively, the claim might be implying that in any given year, she plays with both markus and chen, which isn't possible since a single player can only be in one double per event.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is saying that at some point, she played with both. But looking through each row:\n\nIn 1988: Mark keck and Katrin.\nIn 1989: Chen jin and Katrin.\nNo other rows show her playing with markus again after 1988. So perhaps the claim is about a specific year where she played with both? That doesn't seem to be supported in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's implying that she has played with each of them at different times, not necessarily the same year.\n\nIn 1988, mixed doubles are markus and katrin.\nIn 1989, mixed doubles are chen and katrin.\n\nSo she has played with both markus and chen in separate years. So perhaps the claim is saying that she played with both in mixed doubles at some point, which would be TRUE because in 1988 and 1989, she played with each of them.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"play with both,\" meaning perhaps in the same year or together. But since in each year, she can only have one partner, it's more like she has played with each of them individually, not both at the same time.\n\nSo maybe the claim is slightly ambiguous. If it means that she played with both (each separately), then TRUE because she did play with markus and chen. If it means she played with both in the same mixed doubles team, that's impossible since a pair consists of two people.\n\nBut looking at the claim again: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the mixed double.\" The wording is unclear if it's implying she played with each or all three together. But in reality, she can only have one partner per year in mixed doubles.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because in any given year, she couldn't be paired with both. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that katrin schmidt has played with markus keck and chen jin in the mixed doubles event. By examining each row of the table:\n\n- In 1988: Mixed doubles are markus keck and katrin schmidt.\n- In 1989: Mixed doubles are chen jin and katrin schmidt.\n\nThis shows she has played with both partners individually, but not simultaneously. Thus, the claim is incorrect because a single player cannot have two partners in one event.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mixed_doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mixed_doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Xu Huaiwen was playing in the women's singles category for the years 2003 through 2009. So, my task is to check if there are any entries in the table that match this information.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that each year has separate columns for men's and women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. The relevant column here would be \"women 's singles.\" Each row represents a different year from 1988 to 2013.\n\nSo, I should focus on the \"women 's singles\" column. Let me go through each relevant year in the claim (2003-2009) and see if Xu Huaiwen is listed there.\n\nStarting with 2003: The women's singles for that year is Xu Huaiwen. That's a match.\n\nNext, 2004: Again, it's Xu Huaiwen. Still matches.\n\n2005: Same entry, Xu Huaiwen. So far so good.\n\n2006: Xu Huaiwen is still the name listed under women's singles. Continuing to match.\n\n2007: The entry for women's singles is Wang Yihan. Hmm, that's different from Xu Huaiwen. That means in 2007, she wasn't playing there anymore.\n\n2008: The women's singles is Maria Febe Kusumastuti. Not Xu Huaiwen. So no match here either.\n\n2009: The entry is Juliane Schenk. Again, not Xu Huaiwen.\n\nWait a minute, so from 2003 to 2006, Xu Huaiwen was playing in women's singles, but in 2007 and beyond, she wasn't. That means her participation ended before 2007.\n\nSo the claim says she played from 2003 to 2009, but according to the table, she only played up until 2006. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely accurate because she didn't participate every year mentioned.\n\nI should also make sure I'm not missing any other columns that might be relevant. The claim specifically mentions women's singles, so only that column needs checking. Mixed doubles and others don't apply here.\n\nSo, in summary, while Xu Huaiwen was indeed part of the women's singles from 2003 to 2006, she didn't play every year up until 2009.

It seems like it's saying that Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke played doubles together for three consecutive years. So, I need to check if they were partners in the women's doubles category for three different years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, starting from 1988 up to 2013. The columns are men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. For this claim, I'm interested in the women's doubles column because that's where their partnership would be listed.\n\nNow, I need to look through each row and see if Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke appear together in the women's doubles for three consecutive years.\n\nI'll start by locating Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- 1988: In women's doubles, it's katrin schmidt nicole baldewein.\n- 1989: birgitta lehnert monica halim.\n- 1990: Not present, assuming the next year after 1989 is 1990, but I don't see Marie Roepke yet.\nWait, actually, looking at the table, each row is a specific year. So in 2008, under women's doubles, I see Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke together: \"helle nielsen marie roepke\".\n\nLooking further:\n- 2009: same pairing, helle nielsen marie roepke.\n- 2010: pan pan tian qing. So different partners.\nSo from 2008 to 2009, they played together for two consecutive years.\n\nIs there a third year? Let's check the next few years beyond 2010:\n- 2011: mizuki fujii reika kakiiwa.\n- 2012: wang rong zhang zhibo.\n- 2013: eefje muskens selena piek.\n\nSo, they only played together in 2008 and 2009. That's two years, not three. Therefore, the claim that they played together for three consecutive years is false.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other instances where Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke are paired together elsewhere. For example, maybe in 2007 or 2010, but from the table:\n\n- 2007: yang wei zhang jiewen.\n- 2010: pan pan tian qing.\n\nNope, so only two years. Therefore, the claim is false because it's only two consecutive years, not three.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would be the rows for 2008, 2009, and perhaps others if needed. Wait, actually, since they are only together in 2008 and 2009, the relevant cells are those two years in the women's doubles column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"helle nielsen marie roepke play together in the women's double 3 year in a row,\" we need to check if they were partners for three consecutive years.

Not relevant. 2006: Micha\u0142 \u0141ogosz Robert Mateusiak again. 2007: Mathias Boe Carsten Mogensen. 2008 same as 2007. 2009: Rupesh Kumar Sanave Thomas and someone else.\n\nWait, in 2009, under men's doubles, the pair is Rupesh Kumar Sanave Thomas. So Michael S\u00f8gaard isn't listed here; it's Sanave Thomas with someone else.\n\nContinuing, 2010: Mathias Boe Carsten Mogensen. 2011: Bodin Isara Maneepong Jongjit. Oh, that's one of the names mentioned in the claim. But wait, the doubles partners are Bodin Isara and Maneepong Jongjit, not Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n\nSo, Michael S\u00f8gaard is not playing with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit together in any single year. Let me check 2012: Ingo Kindervater Johannes Schoettler. 2013: Michael Fuchs Birgit Michels. No match there either.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Michael S\u00f8gaard plays men's doubles with both Sanave Thomas and Maneepong Jongjit isn't supported by the table. There's no row where all three are listed as partners in the same year. The only time Sanave Thomas is paired is in 2009 with Rupesh Kumar, not with Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"katrin schmidt and pi hongyan both play 4 time in the women's single\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan have played four times in the women's singles category. So, I need to check how many times each of them appeared as participants in women's singles across the years provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for each player is \"women 's singles\". I'll go through each row and see if either Katrin Schmidt or Pi Hongyan are listed there. The years covered start from 1988 up to 2013.\n\nStarting with Katrin Schmidt:\n\n- In 1988, she's listed under women's singles.\n- In 1989, she's also present in the same category.\n- Moving forward, in 2000, I see her again as part of the women's singles entry.\n- In 2002, she is mentioned again, and then again in 2003. Wait, let me check each year one by one.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table:\n\n1988: Katrin Schmidt\n1989: Katrin Schmidt\n1998: Karolina Ericsson (not Katrin)\n1999: Zheng Yaqiong (not Katrin)\n2000: Xu Huaiwen (not Katrin)\n2001: Pi Hongyan (a different player)\n2002: Pi Hongyan\n2003: Xu Huaiwen\n2004: Xu Huaiwen\n2005: Xu Huaiwen\n2006: Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia (so not Katrin)\n2007: Wang Yihan\n2008: Maria Febe Kusumastuti\n2009: Juliane Schenk\n2010: Liu Xin\n2011: Li Xuerui\n2012: Juliane Schenk\n2013: Nichaon Jindapon\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Katrin Schmidt appears in 1988 and 1989. Let me check each row:\n\n- Year 1988: Women's singles is Katrin Schmidt.\n- Year 1989: Same as above.\n- Then from 1990 to 1997: Not listed, assuming the table skips some years, but since the given data starts at 1988 and goes up to 2013 in steps of one year each, I think.\n\nWait no, looking again, the table has entries for every year from 1988 to 2013. So:\n\nLooking for Katrin Schmidt in women's singles column:\n\n- 1988: Yes\n- 1989: Yes\n- Then from 1990 onwards, up to 2007, I don't see her name again in the women's singles column.\n\nWait, checking each year:\n\n1998: Karolina Ericsson\n1999: Zheng Yaqiong\n2000: Xu Huaiwen\n2001: Pi Hongyan\n2002: Pi Hongyan\n2003: Xu Huaiwen\n2004: Kamila Augustyn (different)\n2005: Xu Huaiwen\n2006: Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia\n2007: Wang Yihan\n2008: Maria Febe Kusumastuti\n2009: Juliane Schenk\n2010: Liu Xin\n2011: Li Xuerui\n2012: Juliane Schenk\n2013: Nichaon Jindapon\n\nSo Katrin Schmidt only appears in 1988 and 1989. That's two times, not four.\n\nNow checking Pi Hongyan:\n\nLooking through the women's singles column:\n\n- 2001: Pi Hongyan\n- 2002: Pi Hongyan\n- Then from 2003 onwards, she doesn't appear again in women's singles until 2011 and 2012, but wait:\n\nWait, let me check each year properly.\n\nPi Hongyan appears in:\n\n2001: Women's singles\n2002: Women's singles\nThen in 2003: Xu Huaiwen\n2004: Kamila Augustyn\n2005: Xu Huaiwen\n2006: Jiang Yanmei Li Yujia\n2007: Wang Yihan\n2008: Maria Febe Kusumastuti\n2009: Juliane Schenk\n2010: Liu Xin\n2011: Li Xuerui\n2012: Juliane Schenk\n2013: Nichaon Jindapon\n\nSo Pi Hongyan is only listed in 2001 and 2002, which is two times. Therefore, both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan have played only twice in women's singles, not four times.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they both play four times is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan each appeared only twice in the women's singles column of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It seems like katrin schmidt was playing doubles with two different partners: markus keck and chen jin. So, I'm looking for instances where katrin schmidt appears in the \"women's singles\" or \"mixed doubles\" columns, paired with both markus keck and chen jin.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1988 to 2013. The relevant columns are men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. \n\nStarting with the \"women's singles\" column: in 1988, katrin schmidt is listed as playing. In 1989, it's also katrin schmidt. Then, in 1998, it's karolina ericsson, so that's a different person. After that, I don't see katrin again in the women's singles column except for 2003 where she's paired with xu huaiwen, but wait, no, looking back: 1988, 1989, then after that, in 1998 it's someone else. So katrin only played women's singles in 1988 and 1989.\n\nNow, looking at the mixed doubles column for katrin schmidt. In 1988, she plays with markus keck. Then, in 2004, I see her playing with rasmus mangor andersen and britta andersen, which is different from both markus keck and chen jin. Wait, but in 1989, the mixed doubles are chen jin and katrin schmidt? Let me check: No, in 1989, women's singles is katrin schmidt, men's singles is stefan frey and robert neumann, women's doubles is birgitta lehnert and monica halim. Mixed doubles for 1989 are chen jin and katrin schmidt? Wait, no: looking at the table, in 1989, mixed doubles are chen jin and katrin schmidt? Let me confirm:\n\nWait, no. Looking back, in 1988, mixed doubles are markus keck and katrin schmidt. In 1989, it's chen jin and katrin schmidt. So in 1988, she's with markus, and in 1989, with chen jin. That means in those two years, she played with both partners as per the claim.\n\nBut wait, in 2004, she's with rasmus and britta, which are different from both markus and chen. So that doesn't matter for this claim.\n\nSo, to verify the claim: we need to check if katrin schmidt was part of mixed doubles with markus keck (1988) and with chen jin (1989). Therefore, in 1988, under mixed doubles, she's with markus. In 1989, she's with chen jin.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nIn 1988:\n- Mixed doubles: markus keck and katrin schmidt.\n\nIn 1989:\n- Mixed doubles: chen jin and katrin schmidt.\n\nTherefore, these two cells support the claim that she played with both in men's doubles. Wait, but wait: in the table, it's mixed doubles, not men's doubles. Hmm, the claim says \"men's double,\" which might be a typo for \"mixed doubles.\" Because in tennis, men's doubles are two men, women's doubles are two women, and mixed doubles are one man and one woman.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is referring to mixed doubles, but it's written as men's singles. So I need to clarify: does the term \"men's double\" refer correctly? If so, then maybe not, because mixed doubles involve a man and a woman. But in the table, mixed doubles are under that column.\n\nWait, looking at the claim again: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" So it's saying she played with both markus and chen in the men's doubles. That doesn't make sense because men's doubles are two men. If she was playing mixed doubles, then she would be paired with one man, not two.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me check: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" So it seems like she is playing with both markus and chen in men's doubles, which would require three people on one side, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue or typo. Maybe they mean mixed doubles, but then she can't be playing with two partners at the same time.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table: in 1988, katrin is in women's singles and mixed doubles with markus keck. In 1989, she's in women's singles again and mixed doubles with chen jin. So that means in those two years, she played mixed doubles with both markus and chen. Therefore, the claim might be accurate if it refers to mixed doubles.\n\nBut the original claim uses \"men 's double,\" which is a bit confusing because men's doubles are two men. Maybe the user made a mistake and meant mixed doubles. If so, then in 1988 and 1989, katrin played with markus and chen in mixed doubles, respectively.\n\nSo, regardless of the wording confusion, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- In 1988, row index 0 (assuming rows are 0-indexed), column \"mixed_doubles\" with markus keck.\n- In 1989, row index 1, column \"mixed_doubles\" with chen jin.\n\nWait, but in the table, row indices might be from 1988 as row 0, 1989 as row 1, etc. So:\n\nRow 0: 1988\nColumn: mixed_doubles: markus keck and katrin schmidt.\nRow 1: 1989\nColumn: mixed_doubles: chen jin and katrin schmidt.\n\nSo those are the two cells that support the claim. Therefore, the answer would be TRUE because she played with both in the relevant years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"mixed_doubles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"mixed_doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
