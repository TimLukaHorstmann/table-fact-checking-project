    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"warren kym perform 16 dance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Warren Kym performed 16 dances. So I'm looking for information in the table related to how many dances they did and their total points, which might indicate performance quality or something similar.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a couple with some details: rank by average, place, the couple's name, total points, number of dances, and average points per dance. \n\nI need to focus on two main aspects from the claim:\n1. Did Warren Kym perform 16 dances?\n2. Is there any relevant information about their performance that might support or contradict this?\n\nStarting with the first part, I should search for \"warren kym\" in the 'couple' column. Scanning through each row, I find that the second row has \"warren & kym\" as the couple name (since it's written as \"warren & kym\"). So, that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, looking at the columns related to dances and points for this couple. The 'number of dances' column shows 16 for Warren & Kym. That directly matches the claim's first part\u2014performing 16 dances. \n\nNext, checking if there's any other data that might affect the truthfulness. The 'total points' column lists 397 for them, but since the claim is about the number of dances, this isn't directly contradictory unless there's a reason to think more points would indicate something else. However, in this context, it seems like more points could mean better performance, but the claim isn't making any qualitative statements about their performance quality, just the quantity.\n\nSo, both aspects of the claim are supported by the table: they performed 16 dances as stated, and their total points back up that they were active participants. Therefore, there's no contradiction or missing information to make the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table. Warren & Kym performed 16 dances, as per the 'number of dances' column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance , for an average of 17.8\". I'm given a markdown table with various columns like rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a different couple or individual, along with their performance details. The claim mentions \"rocco karina\", so I need to look for that in the 'couple' column.\n\nLooking at the 'couple' column, I see rows 11: rocco & karina. So that's the relevant row. Now, let me check each part of the claim against this row.\n\nThe first part is \"score 89 point\". The table has a column called 'total points', which for rocco & karina is 89. That matches.\n\nNext, \"in 5 dance\": the table has 'number of dances' as another column. For rocco & karina, it's 5. So that also matches.\n\nFinally, \"for an average of 17.8\": the table has an 'average' column, which for this couple is 17.8. That matches too.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in row 11. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with all details matching the corresponding cells in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Cody & Julienne's average score is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should look at what the claim says: \"cody & julianne 's average score be 22.5\". So they're talking about the average score for Cody and Julianne. Now, looking at the table provided, which columns are relevant here?\n\nThe table has several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. Since the claim is about the average score, I should focus on the \"average\" column.\n\nNow, I need to find the row where the couple is Cody & Julianne. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. brooke & derek - not them.\n2. warren & kym - nope.\n3. lance & lacey - no.\n4. maurice & cheryl - no.\n5. cody & julianne - yes, this is the couple in question.\n\nSo their row has several values: rank by average 5, place 4, couple Cody & Julianne, total points 292, number of dances 13, and average 22.5.\n\nWait, so their average score is exactly 22.5 as per the table. That matches the claim. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"average\" column in their row is important because it directly supports the claim. So the relevant cell is at row_index 4 (since it's zero-indexed) and the column name is \"average\".\n\nWait, let me double-check the rows. The first row is rank 1 with brooke & derek, so cody & julianne are in the fifth row. But looking at the table markdown:\n\nThe first row is rank by average 1, place 1, couple brooke & derek... up to rank 12.\n\nSo the couple cody & julianne is in the fifth row (index starting from 0 would be row_index 4). So in the JSON, it's zero-indexed. Therefore, the relevant_cells should include {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"average\"}.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be more than 20 dance warren & kym have do together\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim refers to. The key points are \"more than 20 dances,\" \"warren & kym,\" and their total points.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a ranking by average, with columns like place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. So, each row corresponds to a couple, and their performance data.\n\nI need to locate the row where the couple is \"warren & kym.\" Scanning through the 'couple' column, I find that \"warren & kym\" are in rank 2, which is the second row (row index 1 since it starts from 0). \n\nNow, checking the relevant columns for this couple: total points and number of dances. The total points for warren & kym are 397, and they've danced 16 times.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 20 dances.\" Wait, 16 is less than 20. So their number of dances is 16, which doesn't meet the requirement of more than 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because warren & kym have only danced 16 times together, not more than 20.\n\nI should also identify the relevant cells for this check. The row index is 1 (since it's the second row), and the columns are \"number of dances\" and possibly \"total points,\" but since total points don't relate to the number of dances here, maybe only \"number of dances\" is needed. But wait, the claim mentions both \"dance\" and \"points.\" Hmm, perhaps \"total points\" isn't directly related, so maybe only \"number of dances\" needs to be checked.\n\nWait, no, because the user might think that higher total points could imply more dances, but in this case, the claim is specifically about the number of dances. So, the relevant cells are \"number of dances.\" Therefore, I should include both columns: \"total points\" and \"number of dances,\" just to cover all bases, but for the verification, the key column is \"number of dances.\"\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the number of dances \"warren & kym\" have performed together. From the table:\n\n- **Row index**: 1\n- **Couple**: warren & kym\n- **Number of dances**: 16\n- **Total points**: 397\n\nSince 16 is less than 20, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It has several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. Each row represents a different couple along with their performance data.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find the row where the couple is \"cody & julianne.\" Looking through the 'couple' column:\n\n- Row 1: brooke & derek\n- Row 2: warren & kym\n- Row 3: lance & lacey\n- Row 4: maurice & cheryl\n- Row 5: cody & julianne (This is the couple in question)\n- Row 6: toni b & alec\n- Row 7: susan & tony d\n- Row 8: misty & maksim\n- Row 9: ted & inna\n- Row 10: kim k & mark\n- Row 11: rocco & karina\n- Row 12: cloris & corky\n\nSo, cody & julianne are at row index 5. Now, I need to check the 'average' column for this row. The average is given as 22.3.\n\nThe claim states that 22.3 is the average for cody & julianne. Since in the table, their average is indeed listed as 22.3, the claim is supported.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to list which cells are checked. The key columns here are 'average' and 'couple.' For cody & julianne, their row index is 5. So, the two relevant cells are at row 5, column \"average\" and row 5, column \"couple.\"\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I should only include the columns that are part of verifying the claim. The 'couple' column is used to find which row to check, but once found, we look at the 'average' column. So perhaps both cells are relevant because they directly support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the 'average' cell is relevant since it's what the claim refers to. But I think for thoroughness, both cells might be included. However, looking at the example provided, in their JSON they listed two columns: one from row 0 and another from row 1. So perhaps here, we need to include all the cells that were checked.\n\nIn this case, to verify the claim, I looked up the couple's name to find the correct row, then checked the average column. Therefore, both 'couple' (to find the row) and 'average' (to check the value) are relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be at row 5 for both columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
