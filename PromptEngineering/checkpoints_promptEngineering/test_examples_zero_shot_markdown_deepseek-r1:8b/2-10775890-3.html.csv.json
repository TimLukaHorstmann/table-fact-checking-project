    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"On 7 May 1960, a crowd of 9000 watch the away team, Richmond, score 3.8 (26).\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\n1. **Date**: The claim mentions \"7 May 1960.\" Looking at the table, all entries for that day are under the column \"date,\" which indeed shows \"7 may 1960\" as the date in all rows. So the date matches.\n\n2. **Crowd Size**: The claim says there were 9000 people watching. Checking the \"crowd\" column, the first row has 9000, while others have different numbers like 23135, 13802, etc. Since at least one row has 9000, it's possible that this was the crowd for Richmond's game.\n\n3. **Away Team**: The claim specifies the away team is Richmond. Looking at the table, in the first row, the home team is North Melbourne and the away team is Richmond with a score of 3.8 (26). So this matches.\n\n4. **Score**: Richmond scored 3.8 (26), which is explicitly mentioned in the claim. This part also checks out.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim involves four pieces: date, crowd, away team, and their score. Each of these corresponds to specific columns:\n\n- Date: \"date\" column at row 0.\n- Crowd: \"crowd\" column at row 0.\n- Away Team: \"away team\" column at row 0.\n- Score: Both the \"away team score\" and the numerical part (26) are in that same row.\n\nTherefore, all relevant cells are from row 0 for date, crowd, away team, and their scores. \n\nSo, each of these columns is checked against the claim, and they all align correctly. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we check each part of the claim against the table:\n\n- **Date**: The date \"7 May 1960\" matches the \"date\" column in all relevant rows.\n- **Crowd Size**: There's a row with a crowd of 9000, which corresponds to Richmond's game.\n- **Away Team**: The away team for that game is indeed Richmond.\n- **Score**: Richmond scored 3.8 (26), matching the claim.\n\nAll parts are verified by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"3.8 (26) be the away team score against a home team that scored 5.12 (42)\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two scores: 3.8 (26) and 5.12 (42). It mentions that this is an away team score against a home team with 5.12 (42). So, I need to check if there's an entry in the table where an away team scored 3.8 (26) against a home team that scored 5.12 (42).\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several matches with details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. The date for all these matches is 7 May 1960, which suggests they are from the same day. \n\nI should go through each row to see if any match the claim. Let's start by identifying the relevant columns: \"home team\", \"away team\", \"home team score\", and \"away team score\". Each of these will be checked against the claim.\n\nLooking at the first row, the home team is North Melbourne with a score of 5.12 (42), and the away team is Richmond with 3.8 (26). This matches exactly what the claim states: the away team scored 3.8 (26) against a home team that scored 5.12 (42).\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the row where this occurs. Since it's the first row, row_index is 0. The columns to check are \"home team score\", \"away team score\". \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those two in row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"On May 7, 1960, the crowd was larger than 23,135 that watched an away team score of 3.8 (26) and a home team score of 5.12 (42).\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components.\n\n1. The date is May 7, 1960.\n2. The crowd size was larger than 23,135 people.\n3. The away team scored 3.8 (26).\n4. The home team scored 5.12 (42).\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find a match for these conditions.\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n- Row 0: North Melbourne vs Richmond. Home score is 5.12 (42), away is 3.8 (26). The venue is Arden Street Oval, and the crowd was 9,000.\n- Row 1: Melbourne vs South Melbourne. Home scored 16.14 (110), away 6.10 (46). Crowd was 23,135.\n- Row 2: Fitzroy vs Geelong. Home 5.11 (41), away 8.7 (55). Crowd 13,802.\n- Row 3: Hawthorn vs Footscray. Home scored 6.9 (45), away 6.17 (53). Crowd 16,000.\n- Row 4: Essendon vs Collingwood. Home 11.10 (76), away 11.8 (74). Crowd 30,000.\n- Row 5: St Kilda vs Carlton. Home 5.11 (41), away 7.3 (45). Crowd 18,700.\n\nThe claim mentions a home team score of 5.12 (42) and an away team score of 3.8 (26). Looking through the table:\n\n- Only Row 0 has these scores: North Melbourne scored 5.12 (42), Richmond scored 3.8 (26).\n\nSo, for that specific game on May 7, 1960, the crowd was 9,000.\n\nThe claim says the crowd was larger than 23,135. But in this case, it's only 9,000, which is less than 23,135. Therefore, the claim is false because the crowd wasn't larger than 23,135 for that particular game.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row of the table for the specific scores and date mentioned. The relevant game had a much smaller crowd than claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
