    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"when new york be the opponent , the score be 111 - 106\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's asserting that whenever \"new york\" is listed as the opponent in any game, the score should be exactly 111-106.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game. The columns are: game number, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record. \n\nSo I need to go through each row of the table and check if there's any instance where the opponent is \"new york\" and the score is 111-106.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n1. Game 8: Opponent is San Francisco. Score is 109-105.\n2. Game 9: Opponent is Boston. Score is 103-123.\n3. Game 10: Opponent is Baltimore. Score is 119-140.\n4. Game 11: Opponent is San Diego. Score is 114-101.\n5. Game 12: Opponent is San Francisco. Score is 113-106.\n6. Game 13: Opponent is San Francisco. Score is 108-123.\n7. Game 14: Opponent is Seattle. Score is 142-113.\n8. Game 15: Opponent is Philadelphia. Score is 115-116.\n9. Game 16: Opponent is Cincinnati. Score is 125-130.\n10. Game 17: Opponent is Milwaukee. Score is 89-119.\n11. Game 18: Opponent is New York. Let's check the score here. It's 111 - 106, which matches exactly what the claim says.\n12. Game 19: Opponent is Detroit. Score is 129-121.\n13. Game 20: Opponent is Chicago. Score is 114-96.\n14. Game 21: Opponent is Baltimore. Score is 111-118.\n15. Game 22: Opponent is Baltimore. Score is 99-102.\n16. Game 23: Opponent is Cincinnati. Score is 94-91.\n17. Game 24: Opponent is Cincinnati. Score is 126-109.\n\nWait, I just noticed that in the table provided, the opponent for row 18 (game 22) is Baltimore, but earlier, game 14 (row 14) has opponent as Seattle, and then game 18 (row 18) is New York. So when the opponent is New York, the score is 111-106. \n\nSo that means at least one instance where the condition holds true. But the claim says \"when new york be the opponent\", implying that every time New York is the opponent, the score should be 111-106.\n\nBut wait, I only found one row (row 18) where the opponent is New York and the score is 111-106. Are there any other instances? Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all rows, only game 18 has opponent as New York with a score of 111-106. So in that case, it's correct. But does the claim say \"when new york be the opponent\", so maybe it's implying that whenever they are the opponent, the score is that. Since there's only one occurrence, and it matches, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to check if the claim is fully supported. So if in all instances where opponent is New York, the score is 111-106. But since there's only one instance, and it matches, it's TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim could be saying that whenever New York is the opponent, the score is 111-106. Since there's exactly one game where this happens and it matches, then the claim is supported as TRUE.\n\nSo based on the table, the claim holds for at least one game. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we check each row for when the opponent is \"new york\" and verify the score is 111-106.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Opponent as New York:**\n   - Only **row 18** has the opponent listed as \"new york\".\n\n2. **Check Score for That Row:**\n   - The score in row 18 is indeed **111 - 106**, which matches the claim.\n\nSince there's one occurrence where the condition holds and it's accurate, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 113 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Location: Alexander Memorial Coliseum\n2. Score: 113 - 106\n\nI need to find a game in the table that matches both the location and the score.\n\nLooking at the \"location / attendance\" column, I see entries like \"alexander memorial coliseum,\" \"baltimore civic center,\" etc. The claim specifies the location as Alexander Memorial Coliseum, so I should focus on games with that location.\n\nNow, checking each row where the location is \"alexander memorial coliseum.\" \n\nStarting from row 8:\n- Row 8: Score is 109 - 105 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- Row 9: 103 - 123 \u2192 No.\n- Row 11: 114 - 101 \u2192 No.\n- Row 12: 113 - 106 \u2192 This matches the score.\n\nSo, row 12 has both the location as Alexander Memorial Coliseum and the score of 113 - 106. \n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's a game in the table that meets both conditions specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"new york be the opponent at the game with a score of 112 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: \n1. The opponent must be \"New York.\"\n2. The score must be \"112 - 106.\"\n\nI should check each row in the table to see if any game meets both conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: game number, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Game 8: Opponent is San Francisco; score is 109 - 105.\n- Game 9: Opponent is Boston; score is 103 - 123.\n- Game 10: Opponent is Baltimore; score is 119 - 140.\n- Game 11: Opponent is San Diego; score is 114 - 101.\n- Game 12: Opponent is San Francisco; score is 113 - 106. Wait, the opponent here is San Francisco, not New York. The score is 113 - 106, which doesn't match 112 - 106 either.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Game 13: Opponent is San Francisco; score is 108 - 123.\n- Game 14: Opponent is Seattle; score is 142 - 113.\n- Game 15: Opponent is Philadelphia; score is 115 - 116.\n- Game 16: Opponent is Cincinnati; score is 125 - 130.\n- Game 17: Opponent is Milwaukee; score is 89 - 119.\n- Game 18: Opponent is New York; score is 111 - 106. This matches the opponent but not the exact score of 112 - 106.\n\nWait, in game 12, the opponent is San Francisco with a score of 113 - 106. But the claim mentions \"112 - 106.\" So maybe I missed something.\n\nWait no, let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's score:\n- Game 8: 109 - 105\n- Game 9: 103 - 123\n- Game 10: 119 - 140\n- Game 11: 114 - 101\n- Game 12: 113 - 106 (opponent San Francisco)\n- Game 18: opponent New York, score 111 - 106.\n\nSo none of the games have an opponent as New York with a score of exactly 112 - 106. The closest is game 18 with 111 - 106. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no game where New York is the opponent and the score is 112 - 106.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n]}",

The claim is: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 114 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: location and score. I need to check if there's a game that was played at the Alexander Memorial Coliseum with a score of 114 - 106.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns relevant here are \"game\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"score\", \"location / attendance\", and \"record\". \n\nI'll go through each row to find where the location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum and see if any of those games have a score of 114 - 106.\n\nStarting from game 8:\n\n- Game 8: Location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The score is 109 - 105, not matching.\n- Game 9: Same location but score 103 - 123, no match.\n- Game 10: Different location (Baltimore Civic Center), so skip for this check.\n- Game 11: San Diego's venue, not relevant.\n- Game 12: Alexander Memorial again. Score is 113 - 106. Hmm, that's close but not exactly 114 - 106.\n- Game 13: Location is different (Oakland - Alameda County Coliseum Arena), so skip.\n- Games 14 onwards: Some are in different locations or same venue but different scores.\n\nWait, let me double-check game 12. It says the score is 113 - 106. The claim's score is 114 - 106, which is a two-point difference. So that doesn't match either. \n\nLooking through all games, I don't see any where both location and score match exactly. There might be other games at Alexander Memorial with similar scores but not the same exact numbers.\n\nSo, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because none of the games listed in the table have a score of 114 - 106 while being played at the Alexander Memorial Coliseum. \n\nAnswer: \"FALSE\"\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Game 12 has a location of Alexander Memorial Coliseum but a different score (113 - 106).\nNo other games match both the location and score mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
