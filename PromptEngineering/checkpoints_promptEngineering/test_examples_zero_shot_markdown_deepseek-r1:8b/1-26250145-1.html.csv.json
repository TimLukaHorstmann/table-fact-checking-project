    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this determination. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data in the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the way i am be one of 3 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit.\" Breaking this down, I need to check if \"the way i am\" is listed as a song choice under the \"billboard hot 100 hits\" theme. Also, it's specified that it should be one of three such choices.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nI see several rows with different themes and their corresponding song choices. The relevant columns for this claim are \"theme,\" \"song choice,\" and possibly \"order.\" Since the claim mentions \"billboard hot 100 hits\" as the theme, I'll focus on rows where the theme is exactly that.\n\nNow, scanning through each row:\n\n- Week: audition, theme: auditioner's choice, song: hey jude... Not relevant.\n- Hollywood: several themes but not billboard hot 100 hits.\n- Top 24 (12 women): theme is billboard hot 100 hits, song choice is \"the way i am.\" That's a match. So this row is relevant.\n- Next top 20 and top 16 rows also have the same theme, but their song choices are different: lean on me and rhiannon, so not relevant for \"the way i am.\"\n- Then comes top 12 with theme \"the rolling stones\" and song choice \"play with fire,\" unrelated.\n- Finally, top 11 row has the correct theme billboard hot 100 hits, but the song is \"you're no good.\" Not our song.\n\nWait, so in the top 24 row, we have one instance of \"the way i am\" as a song choice under the correct theme. The claim states it should be one of three such choices. But looking at all the rows, I only see this song once. Let me double-check:\n\nTop 24: billboard hot 100 hits, the way i am.\nTop 20: billboard hot 100 hits, lean on me.\nTop 16: billboard hot 100 hits, rhiannon.\n\nSo actually, there are three instances where the theme is billboard hot 100 hits. The songs chosen are different each time: \"the way i am,\" \"lean on me,\" and \"rhiannon.\" Therefore, \"the way i am\" is one of three song choices under that theme. That matches the claim.\n\nSo, to confirm, in the table, there are three entries with the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" each choosing a different song. Among these, \"the way i am\" is indeed one of them, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the presence of \"the way i am\" as one of three song choices under the \"billboard hot 100 hits\" theme in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"song choice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"theme\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"theme\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The important parts are:\n- Didi Benami: This seems to be a person's name.\n- Sand the song choice: This implies that Didi Benami chose a song called \"no one\" before another song called \"hey jude.\"\n- Before hey jude: So, \"no one\" was chosen by Didi Benami before \"hey jude.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if any row has both \"no one\" as the song choice and \"hey jude\" as another song in the same row or related context.\n\nNow, examining each row:\n1. Week: audition, theme: auditioner's choice, song choice: hey jude.\n   - This is where \"hey jude\" is chosen, but it doesn't mention \"no one.\"\n\n2. Week: hollywood, group performance: no one by Alicia Keys.\n   - Here, \"no one\" is the song choice, but \"hey jude\" isn't listed in this row or any other related context.\n\n3. Week: top 24 (12 women), theme: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: the way I am.\n   - Not relevant to either song.\n\n4. Similarly, other rows don't mention both songs together.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the claim is about Didi Benami sanding \"no one\" before \"hey jude.\" In the table, there's no row where both \"no one\" and \"hey jude\" appear as song choices. The only references are separate: \"no one\" in hollywood and \"hey jude\" in audition.\n\nSo, based on this, there's no evidence that Didi Benami chose \"no one\" before \"hey jude.\" They are different weeks and themes, so the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

It mentions a song choice being \"no one\" and that it's not the last song choice for Didi Benami.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result. The 'order' column likely indicates the position in the competition.\n\nI need to find rows where the song choice is \"no one\" and see if it's the last (highest) order number in its respective category. \n\nFrom the table:\n- The top 24 row has song choice \"no one\" with order 9.\n- The top 20 row also has \"no one\" but I think that might be a different week, so probably not relevant here.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the top 24 (12 women) row has song choice \"the way i am\" by Ingrid Michaelson. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, in the table provided:\n\n- The first few rows are under 'hollywood' week with different themes and song choices, but none of them have \"no one\" as the song choice except for the top 24 and other weeks.\n\nWait, let me go through each row properly:\n\n1. audition: hey jude by Beatles, order n/a.\n2. hollywood: first solo, song is terrified, order n/a.\n3. hollywood: group performance, song no one, artist Alicia Keys, order n/a.\n4. hollywood: second solo, song angel, artist Sarah Mclachlan, order n/a.\n5. top 24 (12 women): billboard hits, song the way I am, order 9.\n6. top 20 (10 women): billboard hits, song lean on me, order 5.\n7. top 16 (8 women): billboard hits, song rhiannon, order 5.\n8. top 12: rolling stones, play with fire, order 2.\n9. top 11: billboard 1 hits, song you're no good, order 10.\n\nWait, I see that in row 3, the theme is \"group performance\" and song choice is \"no one\" by Alicia Keys, with order n/a.\n\nSo, does this mean that in the hollywood week's group performance round, \"no one\" was chosen as the song. Now, in that same week, are there other songs? Yes: first solo and second solo. Their orders are also n/a, which likely means they didn't make it to the top.\n\nBut the claim is about Didi Benami's last song choice being \"no one\". I need to check if Didi Benami is in the table as a performer.\n\nLooking through the original artists: Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah Mclachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Wither, Fleetwood Mac, Rolling Stones, Betty Everett. None of these are Didi Benami. Therefore, the claim refers to someone not present in the table, which would make it false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"no one\" was chosen as a song by Didi Benami, but since she's not listed as an original artist, that can't be. So the claim is likely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"no one\" being the last song choice for Didi Benami, but the table doesn't include her as an original artist.

The claim is: \"didi benami be number 5 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women)\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Didi Benami was ranked as number 5 in the order during two specific weeks: the top 20 with 10 women and the top 16 with 8 women.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several rows where each row represents a week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. My task is to check if there are any entries in the 'order' column for Didi Benami during those specific weeks.\n\nBut wait, looking through the table, I don't see any mention of Didi Benami as an original artist or participant. The artists listed are The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah McLachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Wither's (I think it's Billie Eilish?), Fleetwood Mac, and The Rolling Stones, along with Betty Everett. No Didi Benami there.\n\nSo, if Didi Benami isn't present in the table at all, then she can't be ranked as number 5 or any other position.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure and understand what each column represents. The table has several columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. Each row corresponds to a different week with specific details about the performance.\n\nThe claim is about Didi Benami singing \"angel\" before \"lean on me.\" So I need to find if there's any information in the table that connects Didi Benami with these two songs in that order.\n\nLooking at the 'original artist' column, I see names like The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah McLachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Wither, Fleetwood Mac, and The Rolling Stones. None of these match Didi Benami's name. So perhaps the relevant information isn't directly about the original artists but about who performed which song choices each week.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any rows where \"angel\" was performed before \"lean on me.\" But wait, looking at the 'song choice' column, I see entries like \"hey jude,\" \"terrified,\" \"no one,\" \"angel,\" \"the way I am,\" \"lean on me,\" etc. So \"angel\" and \"lean on me\" are both song choices in different weeks.\n\nNow, let's check each row to see if any involve Didi Benami performing \"angel\" before \"lean on me.\" But wait, the 'original artist' doesn't mention Didi Benami. That makes me think that maybe there is no direct connection here because none of the original artists listed are Didi Benami.\n\nHowever, perhaps the claim refers to another context or a different table section not provided. Since I only have this table, I need to work with it.\n\nLooking again, in the top 24 (12 women) row, \"lean on me\" was performed by Bill Wither with an order of 9 and result safe. In another row, \"angel\" was performed by Sarah McLachlan during Hollywood week with an order of 5. But without Didi Benami's name mentioned anywhere in the table, it seems that she didn't perform these songs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"didi benami sing the song choice angel before lean on me.\" So perhaps the 'order' refers to her position in the performance lineup. For example, if Didi Benami performed \"angel\" earlier (lower order number) than someone else performing \"lean on me,\" that would fit.\n\nBut looking at the table, in the top 24 week, \"lean on me\" is by Bill Wither with order 9, and \"angel\" was in Hollywood week (maybe a different row). Wait, no, the Hollywood rows don't have Didi Benami. So perhaps the only relevant cells are where these songs were performed and their respective orders.\n\nBut since there's no Didi Benami in any of the 'original artist' columns, maybe the claim is false because she didn't perform these songs at all. Alternatively, if she did perform them, but I just don't see her name here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the order in which the song choices were performed, regardless of who performed them. But Didi Benami's participation isn't evident from this table, so the claim might be false because there's no evidence supporting it based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"didi benami sing the song choice angel before lean on me\" does not have any supporting information in the provided table.

So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the song choice is \"no one,\" and specifically, it should be the last song choice, meaning the order should indicate it's the latest selection.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result.

Here, the order is listed as n/a. So this isn't helpful because we need an actual number to see if it's last.\n4. **Hollywood (Second Solo)**: Song is \"angel\" \u2013 not relevant.\n5. **Top 24 (12 women)**: Song is \"the way I am\" \u2013 nope.\n6. **Top 20 (10 women)**: Song is \"lean on me\" \u2013 irrelevant.\n7. **Top 16 (8 women)**: Song is \"rhiannon\" \u2013 not the one.\n8. **Top 12**: Song is \"play with fire\" \u2013 nope.\n9. **Top 11**: Song is \"you're no good\" \u2013 irrelevant.\n\nWait, I see in row 3 (Hollywood group performance), the song choice is \"no one.\" The order is listed as n/a, which probably stands for 'not applicable' or not available.

The claim says: \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a hollywood theme.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts. The key points are:\n\n1. **Song Name**: \"terrified\"\n2. **Week Theme**: \"Hollywood theme\"\n3. **She** refers to a specific person who sang this song during that week.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row related to Hollywood weeks because that's where the claim is focused. \n\n- **First row for Hollywood Week**: \n  - Theme: first solo\n  - Song choice: terrified\n  - Original artist: Katharine McPhee\n\nSo here, \"terrified\" was performed during a Hollywood week (first solo theme) by Katharine McPhee.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's any other occurrence of \"terrified\" in the table. \n\n- **Second row for Hollywood Week**:\n  - Theme: group performance\n  - Song choice: no one\n  - Original artist: Alicia Keys\n\nNo match here.\n\n- **Third row for Hollywood Week**:\n  - Theme: second solo\n  - Song choice: angel\n  - Original artist: Sarah McLachlan\n\nAgain, not \"terrified.\"\n\nSo the only occurrence of \"terrified\" is in the first Hollywood week's first solo theme. \n\nThe claim mentions that she sang it during a Hollywood-themed week. Since this row fits both conditions (Hollywood week and song \"terrified\"), the claim should be true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be:\n\n1. Row index 1 (since weeks are ordered starting from 0? Wait, no. Looking at the table, the first row after \"audition\" is Hollywood week with index 1? Or maybe rows are numbered as per their order.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The table has a header row and then each subsequent row is a different week. So the first data row is audition (index 0), then Hollywood (index 1), etc. So the relevant row for \"Hollywood\" theme is index 1.\n\nBut within that row, which columns are relevant? We need to check:\n\n- The week's theme: column \"theme\" should be \"first solo,\" but the claim refers to \"Hollywood theme.\" Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"week with a Hollywood theme.\"\n\nWait, in the table, the weeks like \"Hollywood\" might have different themes each time. So I need to make sure that the week's name is \"Hollywood\" and the song is \"terrified.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Week: Hollywood (index 1)\n  - Theme: first solo\n  - Song choice: terrified\n\nYes, so in this row, both conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 1, column \"theme\" (to confirm it's a Hollywood week with a specific theme)\n- Row index 1, column \"song choice\"\n\nWait, but the claim is about the week having a Hollywood theme. So actually, the row's week name should be Hollywood. But in the table, each row has a 'week' identifier.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1 (Hollywood)\n- column_name: theme (to check if it's first solo, but maybe not necessary for the claim)\nWait, the claim is about \"week with a Hollywood theme,\" but in the table, each row has both 'week' and 'theme.' So actually, the week is named \"Hollywood,\" which is the primary key here. The 'theme' within that week might be first solo, group performance, etc.\n\nTherefore, to confirm the claim, I need to check if there's a row where the week is Hollywood (row index 1) and the song choice is \"terrified.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1\n  - columns: \"theme\" (to see if it's first solo)\n  - column: \"song choice\"\n\nWait, no. The claim doesn't specify the theme within Hollywood week, just that the week was Hollywood-themed. So the primary thing is that in the Hollywood week (row index 1), the song choice is \"terrified.\" Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1\n  - column_name: \"song choice\"\n\nBut wait, the 'theme' column might be necessary to confirm it's a specific type of Hollywood week, but the claim doesn't specify that. It just says \"Hollywood theme,\" which in the table refers to the week being named Hollywood.\n\nSo perhaps only \"song choice\" is relevant for this claim. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check both the week name and song choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'theme' column is part of the week's structure, so for the Hollywood week (row 1), the theme is first solo, but that might not be directly relevant unless the claim refers to that.\n\nI think the key is that in the Hollywood week (row index 1), the song choice is \"terrified.\" Therefore, the cells to check are:\n\n- row_index: 1\n  - column_name: \"song choice\"\n\nAdditionally, maybe the 'week' column to confirm it's Hollywood. But since the claim refers to a week with a Hollywood theme, and in the table, weeks are named as such, so perhaps we need to check both.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has a unique week identifier (like \"audition,\" \"Hollywood,\" etc.), so to check if it's a Hollywood week, looking at the 'week' column is necessary. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1\n  - columns: \"song choice\" and \"week\"\n\nBecause we need to confirm that in the Hollywood week (from the 'week' column), the song choice was \"terrified.\"\n\nSo, in conclusion, the relevant cells are:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n]\n\nBecause it's necessary to confirm that during the Hollywood week, she sang \"terrified.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}]}",

Scanning each row:\n\n1. Audition - hey jude\n2. Hollywood - terrified\n3. Hollywood - no one\n4. Hollywood - angel\n5. Top 24 (12 women) - the way I am\n6. Top 20 (10 women) - lean on me\n7. Top 16 (8 women) - rhiannon\n8. Top 12 - play with fire\n9. Top 11 - you're no good\n\nSo, \"the way i am\" is in row index 5 under the song choice column.\n\nNow, I need to check if this particular instance supports the claim. The claim mentions that it's one of five song choices with the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits.\"\n\nLooking at row 5, the theme is indeed \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" and the song choice is \"the way i am.\" However, I notice there are multiple entries in this theme column: rows 5, 6, 7 all have \"billboard hot 100 hits\" as their theme. That makes three songs, not five.\n\nWait, but let me count again. The theme \"billboard hot 100 hits\" appears in top 24 (row 5), top 20 (row 6), and top 16 (row 7). So that's three song choices, not five as the claim suggests.\n\nAlso, I should check if there are other entries with the same theme. From the table:\n\n- Row 5: billboard hot 100 hits - the way i am\n- Row 6: billboard hot 100 hits - lean on me\n- Row 7: billboard hot 100 hits - rhiannon\n\nSo only three song choices under that theme, not five.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. It states there are five such song choices, but actually, there are only three. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme.\" So, we need to check if there's an instance where \"terrified\" was performed in a week that had a Bollywood theme.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see each row represents a different week, with details like theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. My task is to identify any relevant cells that would confirm or deny this claim.\n\nStarting by scanning through the 'theme' column for weeks that have \"Bollywood\" in them. From the table:\n\n- audition\n- hollywood\n- hollywood\n- hollywood\n- top 24 (12 women)\n- top 20 (10 women)\n- top 16 (8 women)\n- top 12\n- top 11\n\nI don't see any week with \"Bollywood\" in the theme column. So, if the claim is about a Bollywood-themed week, there's no such week in this table.\n\nNext, looking at the 'song choice' column for each week to see if \"terrified\" appears anywhere. Scanning through:\n\n- hey jude\n- terrified\n- no one\n- angel\n- the way i am\n- lean on me\n- rhiannon\n- play with fire\n- you're no good\n\nHere, I do notice that in the second row under 'hollywood' theme, the song choice is \"terrified\" performed by Katharine McPhee. However, since there's no Bollywood theme week mentioned, this instance of \"terrified\" isn't tied to a Bollywood-themed week.\n\nTherefore, even though \"terrified\" was sung in one of the weeks (Hollywood), it wasn't during a Bollywood-themed week as per the table. So the claim doesn't hold true based on the given data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
