    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"ben curtis , j b holmes , steve flesch , and david tom be from the united state.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions four players: ben curtis, j b holmes, steve flesch, and david tom. I need to check if all of them are listed in the table as being from the United States.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row (row 0) is ben curtis. His country is listed as united states. So that's correct.\n2. Next is j b holmes, also from united states. That checks out too.\n3. Steve flesch is another player mentioned in the claim. Looking at the table, I see steve flesch in row 8 (t9) and his country is united states. So that's good.\n4. David tom is the last name in the claim. In the table, there's a david toms listed under player, but it's written as \"david toms.\" Hmm, so maybe it's a typo or different spelling? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in row 8 (t9), we have steve flesch, united states. Then row 9 is another t9 for david toms, also from the united states. But the claim refers to \"david tom,\" which might be a typo for \"tom\" or \"toms.\" Let me check if there's someone named david tom in the table.\n\nLooking through the players:\n\n- ben curtis\n- j b holmes\n- henrik stenson\n- sergio garc\u00eda\n- p\u00e1draig harrington\n- charlie wi\n- andr\u00e9s romero\n- jeev milkha singh\n- aaron baddeley\n- steve flesch\n- david toms\n\nI don't see \"david tom\" listed. Instead, it's \"david toms.\" So perhaps the claim is referring to the wrong name? Or maybe I'm misreading it.\n\nWait, could \"david tom\" be a misspelling or different name variation? The table lists \"david toms,\" which might be a full name like David Toms. If the claim says \"david tom,\" that would mean it's looking for someone not in the table.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- ben curtis: correct\n- j b holmes: correct\n- steve flesch: correct\n- david toms vs. david tom: incorrect\n\nTherefore, one of the names doesn't match exactly as given in the claim. Since the claim specifically mentions \"david tom,\" but the table lists \"david toms,\" it's not fully supported.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"tom\" is a typo and should be \"toms\"? So perhaps it's correct after all? Or maybe the player is indeed named David Tom, which I might have missed. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again at row 9 (t9) for david toms: country is united states. There's also another t9 with camilo villegas from colombia. So, no, there's only one david toms listed, not david tom.\n\nSo the claim includes \"david tom,\" which isn't in the table as per the player names provided. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it misstates the name of the player. Hence, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that ben curtis, j b holmes, steve flesch, and david tom are from the united states. Checking each name:\n\n- Ben curtis: correct\n- J B Holmes: correct\n- Steve Flesch: correct\n- David toms: listed as such in the table; however, the claim uses \"david tom,\" which isn't present.\n\nSince one of the names doesn't match exactly, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by reading both carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"j b holmes from the united state and henrik stenson from sweden tie for second place with -1 to par.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify where in the table these two players are located. Looking at the table, I see that J.B. Holmes is listed as player 2 (t2) in the 'player' column, with a country of united states, and his score is 209, which corresponds to -1 to par. Henrik Stenson is also t2, from Sweden, same score and to par.\n\nSo, both are tied for second place with -1 to par. That seems correct based on the table. \n\nNow, I should check if there's any conflicting information or if they might be in a different position. Scanning through the 'place' column, t2 is indeed second place, so their positions match.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE. The relevant cells are those of J.B. Holmes and Henrik Stenson.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the table for both players:\n\n- **J.B. Holmes** is at row 1 (t2), columns: place=t2, player=j b holmes, country=united states, score=209, to par=-1.\n- **Henrik Stenson** is at row 2 (t2), columns: place=t2, player=henrik stenson, country=sweden, score=209, to par=-1.\n\nBoth are correctly in second place with -1 to par. The claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about three golf players is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"henrik stenson be from sweden , aaron baddeley be from australia , and charlie wi be from south korea.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\nStarting with Henrik Stenson: The claim says he's from Sweden. Looking at the table, I see that there are two players named Henrik Stenson, but wait, actually, no\u2014wait, the first row is for Ben Curtis, then t2 for JB Holmes, t2 for Henrik Stenson, and so on. So, in row 3 (index 2), the player is Henrik Stenson from Sweden with a score of 71+70+68=209 and to par -1. That's correct. So, yes, he's listed as being from Sweden.\n\nNext, Aaron Baddeley: The claim says he's from Australia. In the table, I see rows t9 for several players, including Aaron Baddeley. Let me check: Yes, row 9 (index 8) has Aaron Baddeley from Australia with a score of 71+71+71=213 and to par +3. So that checks out.\n\nLastly, Charlie Wi: The claim states he's from South Korea. Looking at the table, I see a player named Charlie Wi in row t9 (index 8) as well? Wait no, let me check again. Oh, no, wait\u2014row t9 has Aaron Baddeley, Steve Flesch, David Toms, and Camilo Villegas. But then, looking for Charlie Wi, I see that he's in another row. Wait, actually, the table shows row 12 (index 11) as t9 with Camilo Villegas from Colombia, but where is Charlie Wi? Let me scan through each row.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go back to the table:\n\n- Row 1: Ben Curtis\n- t2: JB Holmes\n- t2: Henrik Stenson\n- t4: Sergio Garc\u00eda\n- t4: Padraig Harrington\n- t4: Charlie Wi (I think)\n- t7: Andr\u00e9s Romero\n- t7: Jeev Milkha Singh\n- t9: Aaron Baddeley\n- t9: Steve Flesch\n- t9: David Toms\n- t9: Camilo Villegas\n\nWait, no, in the table as given, row 12 (index 11) is t9 with Camilo Villegas. So Charlie Wi must be elsewhere. Wait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me list out all rows:\n\n1. Ben Curtis\n2. t2: JB Holmes\n3. t2: Henrik Stenson\n4. t4: Sergio Garc\u00eda\n5. t4: Padraig Harrington\n6. t4: Charlie Wi (row 5, index 4)\n7. t7: Andr\u00e9s Romero\n8. t7: Jeev Milkha Singh\n9. t9: Aaron Baddeley\n10. t9: Steve Flesch\n11. t9: David Toms\n12. t9: Camilo Villegas\n\nWait, that can't be right because the table has 12 rows, but perhaps the index starts at 0. Wait no, in the given markdown table, it's written as | place | player | country | score | to par |. So each row is a separate line. Let me count:\n\n- Row 1: Ben Curtis (row_index 0)\n- t2: JB Holmes (row 1)\n- t2: Henrik Stenson (row 2)\n- t4: Sergio Garc\u00eda (row3)\n- t4: Padraig Harrington (row4)\n- t4: Charlie Wi (row5)\n- t7: Andr\u00e9s Romero (row6)\n- t7: Jeev Milkha Singh (row7)\n- t9: Aaron Baddeley (row8)\n- t9: Steve Flesch (row9)\n- t9: David Toms (row10)\n- t9: Camilo Villegas (row11)\n\nSo, Charlie Wi is in row5 (index4). Looking at his details: country is South Korea. Yes, the claim says he's from South Korea. So that checks out.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in the table, Charlie Wi was at t9, but no, it's actually in t4 with a score of 71 +74 +66=211 and to par +1. His country is indeed South Korea.\n\nSo all three players: Henrik Stenson from Sweden, Aaron Baddeley from Australia, and Charlie Wi from South Korea are correctly listed in the table as per the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out for each player's country as provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Sergio Garc\u00eda, P\u00e1draig Harrington, and Charlie Wi tying for 4th place with +1 to par is true based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"sergio garc\u00eda , p\u00e1draig harrington and charlie wi tie for 4th place with + 1 to par.\" I need to verify if these three players are indeed tied in the same position with the same score.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The relevant columns here are \"place,\" \"player,\" \"country,\" \"score,\" and \"to par.\" My main focus is on the \"place\" and \"to par\" columns for the specified players.\n\nStarting with Sergio Garc\u00eda: Scanning through the table, I find him in row 4 under place t4. His score is 69 + 73 + 69 = 211, and his to par is +1. So he's at position t4 with a +1 to par.\n\nNext, P\u00e1draig Harrington is also listed in row 4, same as Sergio, so that's t4. His score is 71 + 74 + 66 = 211, which again gives him a to par of +1. So he's tied with Sergio at t4 with +1.\n\nThen there's Charlie Wi. Looking through the table, I find him in row 6 under place t4 as well. Wait, no, let me double-check that. The players listed for t4 are Sergio, P\u00e1draig, and Charlie. So all three are indeed tied at t4. Each of them has a score adding up to 211 with a +1 to par.\n\nWait, but looking back, in the table, Sergio is row 4 (t4), P\u00e1draig is also row 4 (t4), and Charlie Wi is row 6? No, let me recount the rows properly because the numbering seems off. Let me list out all the players with their places:\n\n1. ben curtis - t1\n2. j b holmes - t2\n3. henrik stenson - t2\n4. sergio garc\u00eda - t4\n5. p\u00e1draig harrington - t4\n6. charlie wi - t4\n7. andr\u00e9s romero - t7\n8. jeev milkha singh - t7\n9. aaron baddeley - t9\n10. steve flesch - t9\n11. david toms - t9\n12. camilo villegas - t9\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the initial table has 12 rows, but the places go up to t9 and then another player at t9. So in row 6, Charlie Wi is listed with place t4? Let me check: the \"place\" column for each row corresponds as follows:\n\nRow 1: t1\nRow 2: t2\nRow 3: t2\nRow 4: t4\nRow 5: t4\nRow 6: t4\nRow 7: t7\nRow 8: t7\nRow 9: t9\nRow 10: t9\nRow 11: t9\nRow 12: t9 (camilo villegas)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the initial markdown table shows each row's place as:\n\n1, t2, t2, t4, t4, t4, t7, t7, t9, t9, t9, t9.\n\nSo, players in rows 4,5,6 are all t4. Sergio is row4 (t4), P\u00e1draig row5 (t4), and Charlie Wi row6 (t4). So all three are indeed tied at t4 with +1 to par.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they tie for 4th place with +1 is correct. Now, I need to make sure that each relevant player's data in the table supports this claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Sergio Garc\u00eda: row index 3 (since it starts from 0), columns \"place\" and \"to par.\"\nWait, no, looking at the JSON example, the relevant_cells are specified by their row_index and column_name. The rows in the table start at 1 as per the markdown, but in JSON, we'll need to index them starting from 0.\n\nSo Sergio is in row4 (index 3), columns \"place\" and \"to par.\" Same for P\u00e1draig and Charlie Wi.\n\nTherefore, I should extract the relevant cells for each of these three players, ensuring their place is t4 and their to par is +1.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check Sergio Garc\u00eda, P\u00e1draig Harrington, and Charlie Wi's positions and scores in the table. All three are tied at 4th place with a +1 to par.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully analyzing both parts of the claim.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Charlie Wi is from the United States.\n2. Aaron Baddeley is also from the United States.\n\nTo verify each part, I'll need to look up their information in the provided table. The table has several columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. My focus will be on the \"player\" column for Charlie Wi and Aaron Baddeley to see their respective countries.\n\nStarting with Charlie Wi:\n\nLooking through the \"player\" column, I find that there's a row where the player is \"charlie wi.\" Let me check the corresponding \"country\" cell. According to the table, his country is listed as \"south korea.\" South Korea is not the same as the United States. So, Charlie Wi is from South Korea, not the United States.\n\nNow, checking Aaron Baddeley:\n\nIn the \"player\" column again, there's a row for \"aaron baddeley.\" His country is stated as \"australia.\" Australia is different from the United States as well. Therefore, Aaron Baddeley is from Australia, not the U.S.\n\nWait, but I also notice that both Steve Flesch and David Toms are listed under \"united states,\" so they might be relevant, but since the claim specifically mentions Charlie Wi and Aaron Baddeley, those two are the ones to focus on.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim says both Charlie Wi and Aaron Baddeley are from the United States. However, according to the table, they're actually from South Korea and Australia, respectively. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of confusion or typos in the names, but looking at the table, it clearly lists \"charlie wi\" with a country of south korea, and \"aaron baddeley\" as being from australia. There doesn't seem to be any typo here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because neither Charlie Wi nor Aaron Baddeley is from the United States based on the information provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"}]}",

Looking at the table, I see that there are two players named Henrik Stenson? Wait, no, actually, the table shows \"henrik stenson\" in row 3 (since it's a markdown table and rows start from 1). So checking row t2 (which is index 2 if we count starting at 0 or maybe not\u2014I need to be careful with the indices. The first row is 1, so row numbers are 1 to 12. So for \"henrik stenson,\" his country is Sweden as per column 'country' in row t2.\n\nNow, the claim says he's from Australia. That doesn't match. So that part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, Aaron Baddeley. The table has a player named aaron baddeley in row t9 (index 9 if starting at 0). His country is Australia. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking back, Aaron Baddeley's country is Australia according to the table. So the claim says he's from South Korea, which is wrong.\n\nLastly, Charlie Wi.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about Camilo Villegas and David Toms is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"camilo villegas from colombia and david tom from the united state tie for 9th place with + 3 to par.\" So, the claim is making two main points: that Camilo Villegas and David Toms are tied in 9th place, and both have a score of +3 to par.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where Camilo Villegas and David Toms are located. Scanning through the \"player\" column:\n\n- Camilo Villegas is listed under row index 11 (since rows start from 0) in the t9 position.\n- David Toms is also listed under row index 9, also in the t9 position.\n\nSo both players are indeed tied for 9th place. Now, let's check their scores and to-par values.\n\nCamilo Villegas has a score of 74 + 72 = 146, which equals 213 when added together (74+72=146, but wait, that doesn't add up correctly. Wait, looking again: in the table, it's written as 74 + 72 = 67 = 213. That might be a typo, but in reality, 74 plus 72 is 146, not 67. So perhaps it's a formatting error, and the correct total score should be 213. The to-par for Camilo is +3.\n\nDavid Toms has a score of 72 + 69 + 72 = 213, which matches the total, and his to-par is also +3. \n\nSo both players have the same position (t9) and the same to-par (+3). Therefore, the claim seems correct on the surface.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are other players who might tie them or if they're not the only ones in 9th place. Looking at the table:\n\n- The t9 row includes Camilo Villegas (colombia), David Toms (united states), Aaron Baddeley (australia), Steve Flesch (united states), and another David Toms? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, in the table:\n\n- Row 8: t9, player: aaron baddeley\n- Row 9: t9, player: steve flesch\n- Row 10: t9, player: david toms\n- Row 11: t9, player: camilo villegas\n\nWait, that's four players in t9. So Camilo and David are two of them, but there are others as well. The claim says they \"tie for 9th place,\" which is technically correct because they share the same position, even if others are also in 9th.\n\nHowever, sometimes in golf, when multiple players tie, it's considered a multi-way tie, so their individual positions might be considered as tied among themselves, but still in 9th. So the claim doesn't specify that they're the only ones, just that they tie for 9th. So that part is correct.\n\nSo both Camilo and David are in t9 with +3 to par. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait a moment: I noticed that Camilo's score is written as 74 +72=67=213. That seems off because 74+72 is 146, not 67. Maybe it's a typo, but regardless of the individual rounds, the total is correctly stated as 213. So perhaps in the table, the scores are miscalculated, but the important thing is that both have the same total and to-par.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States tie for 9th place with +3 to par. Checking the table:\n\n- Camilo Villegas is in t9 with a score of 213 and +3 to par.\n- David Toms is also in t9 with the same score and to-par.\n\nBoth are correctly positioned, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Sergio Garc\u00eda: t4 position, score 211, to par +1.\n2. P\u00e1draig Harrington: t4, same as above.\n3. Charlie Wi: t4, same as above.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says they tie for third place, but looking at the table, all three are in t4, which is tied for fourth place, not third.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"jb holmes from the united state and henrik stenson from sweden tie for third place with + 1 to par.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. Let me break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: JB Holmes and Henrik Stenson. I need to find them in the table. Scanning through the \"player\" column, I see JB Holmes listed as t2 (tie for second) with a score of 209 and -1 to par. That's correct because the claim says they tie for third, so that seems off already.\n\nWait, no, the claim says they tie for third place. But in the table, JB Holmes is at t2, not t3. So that would make the claim incorrect. But maybe I'm misinterpreting something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the players and their positions. Let me list out all the players:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. ben curtis - united states\nt2. j b holmes - united states\nt2. henrik stenson - sweden\nt4. sergio garc\u00eda - spain\nt4. p\u00e1draig harrington - ireland\nt4. charlie wi - south korea\nt7. andr\u00e9s romero - argentina\nt7. jeev milkha singh - india\nt9. aaron baddeley - australia\nt9. steve flesch - united states\nt9. david toms - united states\nt9. camilo villegas - colombia\n\nSo, the players mentioned in the claim are JB Holmes (t2) and Henrik Stenson (t2). The claim says they tie for third place. But according to the table, they are both tied at second place (t2), not third.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let me check the \"place\" column:\n\nThe top of the table shows places as 1, t2, t2, t4, etc. So, the first position is 1st place, then t2 means tied for second, and so on. \n\nSo, if both JB Holmes and Henrik Stenson are at t2, they're both tied for second place, not third. Therefore, the claim that they tie for third is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check further. The claim also mentions \"+ 1 to par.\" Looking at their scores:\n\nJB Holmes: 71 + 68 + 70 = 209. To par would be calculated by subtracting 209 from the total par of the course, but since that's not given, maybe the \"to par\" column is provided. For JB Holmes, it's -1, so yes, he's one under par.\n\nHenrik Stenson: same score as JB Holmes, so also -1 to par.\n\nNow, where are they placed? In the table, t2 means tied for second place. So their position is t2, not third. Therefore, they aren't in third place.\n\nBut wait, looking at the claim again: it says \"tie for third place.\" So that's incorrect because according to the table, they're tied for second. Unless I'm miscounting the positions.\n\nLet me list out all the players with their tie positions:\n\n1. Ben Curtis - 1st\nt2. JB Holmes - 2nd (tied)\nt2. Henrik Stenson - 2nd (tied)\nt4. Sergio Garc\u00eda - 4th (tied)\nt4. Padraig Harrington - 4th (tied)\nt4. Charlie Wi - 4th (tied)\nt7. Andr\u00e9s Romero - 7th (tied)\nt7. Jeev Milkha Singh - 7th (tied)\nt9. Aaron Baddeley - 9th (tied)\nt9. Steve Flesch - 9th (tied)\nt9. David Toms - 9th (tied)\nt9. Camilo Villegas - 9th (tied)\n\nSo, the players JB Holmes and Henrik Stenson are both in t2, which is tied for second place, not third. Therefore, the claim that they tie for third is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, looking at their scores: both have +1 to par as well? Wait, no. The \"to par\" column shows -1 for both. So perhaps the claim is incorrect on two counts: their position and the to par score.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"+ 1 to par,\" while in reality it's \"-1.\" So that's another discrepancy.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because they are tied for second place, not third, and their to par is -1, not +1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect as both JB Holmes and Henrik Stenson are tied for second place, not third, and have a score of -1 to par. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about Camilo Villegas and David Tom is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Tom from the United States tie for eighth place with +4 to par.\" So, I need to check if both players are in 8th place and their scores have a to-par of +4.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that Camilo Villegas is listed under \"player\" as \"camilo villegas,\" from Colombia. His score is 74 + 72 = 146, which adds up to 213. The to par column shows \"+3.\" Hmm, so he's not at +4.\n\nNow, checking David Tom. His row has the player as \"david toms,\" from the United States. His score is 72 + 69 + 72 = 213, same as Camilo. The to-par here is also +3. So both have a to-par of +3, not +4.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the scores. Let me check again. For Camilo Villegas: \"74 + 72 = 67 = 213.\" Oh, perhaps that's a typo? It looks like he scored 74 in one round and 72 in another, totaling 146, but it's written as 67=213. That seems off because 74+72 is 146, not 67. So maybe the score was miscalculated or presented incorrectly.\n\nRegardless of that confusion, the key point is the to-par. Both have +3, so they're not at +4. Therefore, the claim about them tying for eighth with +4 is incorrect. They are actually tied in ninth place, as both their rows are marked as t9 (tied 9th) and they have a score of 213 which corresponds to +3.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because the to-par isn't +4 but +3, and they're not eighth but tied ninth.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because both Camilo Villegas and David Tom have a to-par of +3, not +4, and are tied for ninth place, not eighth. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
