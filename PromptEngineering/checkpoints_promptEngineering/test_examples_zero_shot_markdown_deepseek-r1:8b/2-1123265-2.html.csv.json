    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the driver is Tarso Marques in the table provided. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. damon hill\n2. jean alesi\n3. michael schumacher\n4. mika h\u00e3\u00a4kkinen\n5. mika salo\n6. olivier panis\n7. eddie irvine\n8. pedro diniz\n9. ukyo katayama\n10. pedro lamy\n11. luca badoer\n12. martin brundle\n13. rubens barrichello\n14. heinz - harald frentzen\n15. david coulthard\n16. johnny herbert\n17. jacques villeneuve\n18. gerhard berger\n19. andrea montermini\n20. ricardo rosset\n21. jos verstappen\n22. tarso marques\n\nI see Tarso Marques is in row 22. Now, I need to check the 'laps' column for this driver. From the table, Tarso Marques has 0 laps completed.\n\nThe claim says \"tarso marque do not complete any lap.\" Since he has 0 laps, that means he didn't complete any. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'laps' column is where the number of completed laps is recorded. Therefore, row_index 22 and column_name \"laps\" are the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Tarso Marques not completing any laps, we check his entry in the table.\n\n1. **Locate the driver**: Tarso Marques is found in row 22.\n2. **Check completed laps**: His 'laps' count is 0, indicating no laps were completed.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, supported by the relevant cell.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Tarso Marques is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Tarso Marques start in grid 13 but do not complete any lap.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find Tarso Marques. Scanning through the 'driver' column, I see that the last entry is for Tarso Marques. His details are: he started in grid position 21, completed 0 laps, and retired due to being spun off.\n\nSo, the first part of the claim says Tarso Marques started in grid 13. But according to the table, he actually started in grid 21. That means this part is false. \n\nThe second part claims that he didn't complete any lap. Looking at the 'laps' column, it's indeed 0 for Tarso Marques. So this part of the claim is true.\n\nSince the first part is incorrect and the second part is correct, the overall claim is false because one of its statements isn't supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
