    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"montreal be the visitor on march 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it states that Montreal was the visitor on March 6. So, my goal is to find the relevant cells in the table that could verify this information.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific date, and there are several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Since the claim is about who the visitor was on March 6, I need to locate the corresponding row for March 6 and check the \"visitor\" column.\n\nI'll scan through each row until I find the one with the date March 6. Let's see:\n\n1. March 1: Visitor is Philadelphia\n2. March 2: Visitor is NY Rangers\n3. March 4: Visitor is Philadelphia\n4. March 6: Visitor is Montreal\n5. March 8: Visitor is Carolina\n6. March 11: Visitor is Buffalo\n7. March 12: Visitor is Philadelphia\n8. March 15: Visitor is Philadelphia\n9. March 17: Visitor is Philadelphia\n10. March 18: Visitor is Philadelphia\n11. March 21: Visitor is New Jersey\n12. March 22: Visitor is Philadelphia\n13. March 25: Visitor is Ottawa\n14. March 28: Visitor is Toronto\n\nSo, the row for March 6 has \"montreal\" listed as the visitor in the \"visitor\" column. That seems to directly support the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The columns related to the claim are \"date\", \"visitor\", and perhaps others like \"attendance\" or \"record,\" but those don't seem directly relevant here unless they're used to verify something about the game itself. However, since the claim is specifically about who the visitor was on March 6, only the \"visitor\" column is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the key cells are the row index for March 6 and the \"visitor\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"before March 6 Montreal be the visitor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The rows list various games happening on different dates in March.\n\nThe claim is about Montreal being the visitor before March 6. So, I need to check all the games scheduled before March 6 and see if any of them have Montreal listed as the visitor.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date. I'll go through each date one by one until March 6 and check the 'visitor' column for each.\n\n- March 1: Visitor is Philadelphia.\n- March 2: Visitor is NY Rangers.\n- March 4: Visitor is Philadelphia.\n- March 6: Visitor is Montreal.\n\nWait, the game on March 6 has Montreal as the visitor. But the claim says \"before March 6,\" so I need to check all games before March 6. That would include up to March 5 or earlier.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- March 1: Philadelphia\n- March 2: NY Rangers\n- March 4: Philadelphia\n- March 6 is on or after the target date, so it's not \"before.\"\n\nSo, in all games before March 6 (which are up to March 1, March 2, March 4), Montreal is never the visitor. Therefore, there is no evidence supporting the claim that Montreal was the visitor before March 6.\n\nHence, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"before March 6, Montreal be the visitor\" isn't supported by any data in the table up to March 5. The only time Montreal appears as a visitor is on March 6, which doesn't meet the condition of being before March 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
