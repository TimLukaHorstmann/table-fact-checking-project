    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"evita be nominate for a tony award and a drama desk award in 2012.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result. Each row represents an award nomination or win for a specific production.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions \"evita\" being nominated for both a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award in 2012. So I need to find any entries in the table from 2012 where the nominated work is \"evita.\"\n\nI'll start by skimming through each row of the table for the year 2012. \n\nRow 1: 1993, so not relevant.\n...\nThen I see row 10: 2012\n- Award: Tony Award, Category: best performance by a featured actor in a musical, Nominated work: evita, Result: nominated.\nSo that's one nomination for a Tony Award.\n\nNext, row 11: 2012\n- Award: Drama Desk Award, Category: outstanding featured actor in a musical, Nominated work: evita, Result: nominated.\nThat's another nomination for the Drama Desk Award.\n\nSo both the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award entries for \"evita\" are marked as \"nominated.\" Therefore, the claim that \"evita be nominate for a tony award and a drama desk award in 2012\" is correct because it was indeed nominated for both awards in that year.\n\nI should make sure there are no other entries for \"evita\" in 2012. Checking further, row 10 and 11 are the only ones related to evita in 2012, so those two cells are relevant.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each entry in the table for the year 2012. Both the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award entries for \"evita\" show \"nominated,\" confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tony award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"drama desk award\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two things: the work (\"Sweeney Todd...\"), the award category (\"Drama League Award\"), and the year (2006). \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the nominated work is \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" and the year is 2006. Then, check if any of those rows have a result of \"nominated\" for the Drama League Award.\n\nLet me scan through each row in 2006:\n\n1. **2006:**\n   - **Tony Award (Best performance by a leading actor):** Sweeney Todd... | Result: Nominated\n   - **Drama Desk Award:** Same as above, same result.\n   - **Drama League Award:** This is the one we care about. It's nominated.\n   - **Outer Critics Circle Award:** Also nominated.\n\nSo in 2006, \"Sweeney Todd...\" was indeed nominated for the Drama League Award. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nI don't see any discrepancies in the table that would contradict this. All relevant columns check out as 'nominated' except for the Tony and Drama Desk which are separate awards.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Drama League Award\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"in 2012 evita be nominate for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify relevant rows and columns. The year mentioned is 2012, so I'll look at the row where year is 2012. Looking at the table, there are two entries for 2012.\n\nThe first entry for 2012 has the award as Tony Award, category best performance by a featured actor in a musical, nominated work \"evita\", and result \"nominated.\" So this seems relevant because it matches the claim's year, award type, category, and work. \n\nWait, the claim mentions being \"nominate\" which is probably a typo for \"nominated,\" but since the table uses \"nominated,\" that should still be considered correct.\n\nThe second entry in 2012 has the drama desk award, but the category is outstanding featured actor, same as the first entry. However, the claim specifically mentions \"outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" \n\nLooking at the categories: the first entry's category is \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical,\" which matches exactly what the claim refers to. The second entry has \"outstanding featured actor in a musical\" as the category but under drama desk award, so it might be a different award. However, both entries for 2012 are about evita and the same or similar categories.\n\nSo, I need to check if there's an entry in 2012 where the award is Tony Award, category is best performance by a featured actor in a musical, work is evita, and result is nominated. \n\nYes, that's the first row for 2012: \"evita\" was nominated for Tony Award in that category. Therefore, the claim is true based on this information.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"be nominate,\" which might imply that the actor actually won, but according to the table, it's only nominated. So does \"nominate\" mean they didn't win? The result column shows \"nominated\" for evita in 2012. So if the claim is stating that they were nominated, then it's true. If it was claiming they won, it would be false.\n\nBut the original claim says \"evita be nominate,\" which probably means they were nominated, not necessarily winning. So since the table shows \"nominated\" for evita in 2012, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2012, \"evita\" was nominated for outstanding featured actor in a musical. The relevant row is the one with year 2012 where the award is Tony Award and the category matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"evita be nominate work after 2006, that be award the outer critic circle award and the outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify all parts of the claim that mention specific awards and works. The claim mentions \"evita\" as the nominated work, which happened after 2006. So I need to look for any entries where the awarded work is \"evita\" and the year is after 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, in 2012, there are two entries related to \"evita\". The first one is a Tony Award entry: \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical,\" but it's marked as \"nominated.\" The second is a Drama Desk Award entry for \"outstanding featured actor in a musical,\" also \"nominated.\"\n\nWait, so both of these are nominated awards. The claim says \"evita be nominate work after 2006,\" which seems correct because the nominations were in 2012. But then it mentions that \"that be award\" (probably meaning that they won) both the outer critic circle award and the outstanding featured actor in a musical.\n\nLooking at the table, in 2012 for \"evita,\" neither of the awards are marked as \"won.\" Both are \"nominated.\" There's no entry for an outer critics circle award in 2012; I only see entries up to 2012. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it says that evita won both these awards, but actually they were only nominated.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the ones where the work is \"evita,\" and the columns are \"category\" and \"result.\" Also, since the year must be after 2006, we're looking specifically at 2012. So I need to check the two entries for evita in 2012: one for Tony Award (best performance by a featured actor) and another for Drama Desk Award (outstanding featured actor).\n\nTherefore, these cells are relevant because they show that evita was only nominated, not awarded, for both categories in question after 2006.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if \"evita\" won the specified awards after 2006. In 2012, both nominations were marked as \"nominated,\" not \"won.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the year be 2007 when evita nominate for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions the year 2007, the work \"Evita,\" the award category \"outstanding featured actor in a musical,\" and the result should be \"nominate.\" So I need to check if there's an entry in the table for Evita in 2007 under that specific award category.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the year, award, category, nominated work, and result. My task is to scan through each row to see if any match all the criteria of the claim.\n\nStarting with the year 2007. I'll look for rows where the 'year' column is 2007. Scanning down:\n\n- 2007: several entries. The first one mentions the drama league award, distinguished performance, for \"king lear.\" So that's not relevant.\n- Next is the Tony Award for best performance by a leading actor in \"lovemusik.\" Not relevant to Evita.\n- Drama Desk Award for outstanding actor in \"lovemusik.\" Still not Evita.\n- Another drama league award for \"lovemusik.\" Not relevant.\n- Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding actor in \"lovemusik.\" Again, not Evita.\n\nSo the only entries for 2007 are related to \"king lear\" and \"lovemusik,\" none of which mention Evita. That suggests there's no Evita entry in 2007.\n\nNow, checking other years: looking at 2012, there's an entry for Evita with both Tony and Drama Desk Awards, but both are marked as \"nominated.\" So Evita was nominated in 2012, not 2007.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Evita was nominated for outstanding featured actor in a musical in 2007 is FALSE because there's no such entry in the table. The closest entries for Evita are in 2012, which also resulted in nominations but not a win.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Evita\" was nominated for an outstanding featured actor in a musical in the year 2007. However, upon examining the table, there is no entry for \"Evita\" in 2007 under any award category related to outstanding featured actors in music.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2012, \"column_name\": \"Tony Award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2012, \"column_name\": \"Drama Desk Award\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the who 's tommy / sweeney todd : the demon barber of fleet street be the nominated work , nominate for the drama league award after 2007\"\n\nBreaking it down, it mentions two nominated works: \"the who's tommy\" and \"sweeney todd : the demon barber of fleet street.\" It specifically talks about being nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if these specific works were ever nominated for the Drama League Award post-2007. \n\nFirst, let me list out all entries where either \"the who's tommy\" or \"sweeney todd : the demon barber of fleet street\" is the nominated work and see when they were nominated.\n\nFor \"the who's tommy\":\n- It appears in 1993, as a nominee for Drama League Award (nominated).\n- Not listed after that, so no further entries.\n\nFor \"sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\":\n- In 2006, it was nominated for Drama League Award.\n- Also, in 2006, it was nominated for other awards like Tony and Drama Desk.\n\nWait, the claim mentions being nominated for Drama League Award after 2007.
