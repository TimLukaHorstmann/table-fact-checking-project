    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand what each column represents. The columns are rank, name, season, club, goals, apps, and goals per match.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the player ranked 11. So my first step is to find which row corresponds to rank 11 in the table.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that there's a row with rank 11: \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\" from season 1956/57 playing for Real Madrid. His goals per match is 1.0, as shown in the column.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that this player has \"less than 1.237 goal per match.\" Since 1.0 is less than 1.237, this part of the claim seems to hold true based on the data.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm not missing any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The relevant cells would be the ones for rank 11 and goals per match. \n\nSo, the relevant_cells are:\n- For row index 10 (since it's 0-based), looking at the \"goals per match\" column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the player ranked 11 has a goals per match of exactly 1.0, which is indeed less than 1.237.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell corresponds to rank 11 and the goals per match, which is 1.0. Since 1.0 is less than 1.237, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237.\" Hmm, wait, I think there might be a typo here. It probably means \"there exists a rank number 11 with goals per match greater than 1.237.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table columns to understand what each column represents. The table has columns: rank, name, season, club, goals, apps (appearances), and goals per match.\n\nThe claim is about the \"rank that have goal per match more than 1.237.\" So, I need to find all players who scored a goals per match of more than 1.237.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row and check the 'goals per match' column.\n\nStarting from rank 1: Lionel Messi in 2011/12 had 1.217, which is less than 1.237. Next, Cristiano Ronaldo in 2011/12 had 1.091, also less. Then, in 2012/13, Ronaldo had exactly 1 goal per match, which is equal but not more. Messi that same season had 1.224, still below 1.237.\n\nLooking further down, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s in 1959/60 had 1.237, which is exactly the threshold mentioned in the claim. So, does that count? The claim says \"more than\" 1.237, so equal doesn't count. Then, Hugo S\u00e1nchez in 1986/87 had 0.759, way below.\n\nWait, but looking at row 7: Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s has 1.237, which is exactly the value mentioned. However, the claim says \"more than,\" so maybe it's only looking for values above that. Also, another player, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano in 1956/57 had 1 goal per match, which is equal but not more.\n\nAnother thing to note: the highest goals per match in the table is 1.278 by Telmo Zarra in 1950/51. But he's rank 10. However, the claim specifically mentions \"11.0 be the rank,\" so we need a player ranked at position 11 who has more than 1.237.\n\nLooking through the ranks, rank 11 is Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano with 1 goal per match, which doesn't exceed 1.237. Rank 12 includes multiple players: Pusk\u00e1s (1.077), Hugo S\u00e1nchez (0.933), Baltazar (0.913). None of them have a goals per match over 1.237.\n\nWait, but wait. The highest is 1.278 at rank 10 by Telmo Zarra, which is higher than 1.237, but he's rank 10, not 11. So the claim says rank 11 has someone above 1.237. But in the table, rank 11 has Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano with exactly 1, so no.\n\nWait another thing: looking back at the data, is there any player ranked 11 who has more than 1.237? Let me check each row:\n\nRank 1-10 don't have anyone above 1.237 except maybe Telmo Zarra at 1.278 but he's rank 10. Then rank 11: Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, goals per match is exactly 1.\n\nSo, no player ranked 11 has a goals per match more than 1.237. Therefore, the claim is false because there isn't a rank 11 player with that stat.\n\nWait, but wait again: The table lists rank 7 as Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s (1.237) and others, but none at rank 11 have higher than that except maybe looking elsewhere. Wait, no, in the data provided, after rank 10 comes 11, which is Di St\u00e9fano with 1.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that rank 11 has someone above 1.237. Since there's no such player, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that rank 11 has a player with a goals per match greater than 1.237. However, checking the table, the only player at rank 11 (Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano) has exactly 1 goal per match, which does not exceed 1.237.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Lionel Messi is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see if it matches any entries in the table. The claim has two main points: Lionel Messi's rank and his goals scored during the 2011/12 season.\n\nStarting with the rank, I need to find all rows where \"name\" is Lionel Messi and the \"season\" is 2011/12. From the table, I see that there are three entries for Lionel Messi:\n\n1. Rank 1 in the 2011/12 season with 73 goals.\n2. Rank 2 in the 2012/13 season with 60 goals.\n3. Rank 5 in the 2010/11 season with 53 goals.\n\nSo, the claim is saying he was rank 2 during the 2011/12 season. Looking at his entries for that season, I don't see any row where his name is Lionel Messi and the season is 2011/12 with a rank of 2. The only entry matching season 2011/12 is when he's ranked 1.\n\nNext, checking the goals part: the claim says 73 goals in 2011/12. Looking again at the table, yes, there is an entry where Lionel Messi has 73 goals for the 2011/12 season. However, that corresponds to his rank being 1, not 2.\n\nSo, while he did score 73 goals that season, he was ranked number 1, not 2. Therefore, the claim's statement about his rank is incorrect.\n\nI should also check if there's any other row for 2011/12 where someone else has rank 2 and scored 73 goals, but looking at the table, in 2011/12, only Lionel Messi is ranked 1 with 73 goals. Cristiano Ronaldo is ranked 2 that season, but he scored 60 goals, not 73.\n\nIn summary, the claim incorrectly states his rank for that season. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
