The claim is: \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match be held in Bolivia in June 2008.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each column in the table to see what information it provides. The columns are date, venue, score, result, and competition. \n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: the location (Bolivia) and the month (June 2008). So, I need to check if any of the matches listed fit these criteria.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Date is June 15, 2008. Venue is Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia. The competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. So this seems relevant because it's about a match in Bolivia during June 2008 related to the 2010 qualification.\n\n2. Row 1: Same date and venue as row 0, but different score and result. It's also part of the same competition. So this is also relevant for the same reason.\n\n3. Rows 2-4 are about other dates, venues, competitions, so they don't fit the claim.\n\nNow, focusing on rows 0 and 1: Both have the venue in Bolivia and occurred in June 2008 during a FIFA World Cup qualification match for 2010. Therefore, these two matches support the claim that such a qualification match was held in Bolivia in June 2008.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row indices 0 and 1, and the column is 'venue' because it specifies the location.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Venue is Estadio Hernando Siles, Bolivia. Not relevant.\n2. **Second Row (Same as above):** Same date and venue, also irrelevant.\n3. **Third Row (29 May 2009):** This is in May 2009. Venue is Fukuda Denshi Arena, Chiba, Japan. The competition is listed as \"friendly.\" The score is 1-1, which indicates a tie because both teams scored the same.\n4. **Fourth and Fifth Rows:** These are in October 2011 and 2013 respectively, so not May 2009.\n\nFocusing on the third row: It's in May 2009 at Fukuda Denshi Arena, Japan.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Estadio Monumental is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the estadio monumental be locate in santiago , chile and host qualification match for the 2014 fifa world cup.\" So, the claim has two main points: location and hosting qualification matches for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find cells related to these points. The table has columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. \n\nStarting with the location: The claim mentions Santiago, Chile. Scanning through the table, I see that two entries are for Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile: one on October 11, 2011, and another on October 15, 2013. Both have the venue as Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile. So, these cells definitely support the location part of the claim.\n\nNext, hosting qualification matches for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the table, there are two entries for the competition: \"2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification\" and \"2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification.\" The Estadio Monumental in Santiago is associated with both the 2011 and 2013 matches under the 2014 qualification. Wait, actually, the dates are October 11, 2011, and October 15, 2013. That would be for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification, right? So yes, Estadio Monumental hosted these matches.\n\nPutting it all together, both the location and hosting of qualification matches align with what's in the table.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"More points be scored by the winning team in the 2011 World Cup qualification match in Chile than in the 2013 match.\" So, I need to compare the points (or score) of the winning teams from the 2011 and 2013 matches in Chile.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are two matches related to Chile: one on October 11, 2011, and another on October 15, 2013. Both are under \"2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" So, these are likely the two matches we need to compare.\n\nNext, let's identify which columns are relevant. The table has 'date,' 'venue,' 'score,' 'result,' and 'competition.' Since the claim is about points scored by the winning team, the 'score' column will be important. Also, I need to confirm which team won each match because the score might reflect that.\n\nLooking at the 2011 match (October 11), the score is 3-0 for Chile against Ecuador. So, Chile won this match. The result in the table shows a score of 3-0 and the competition as 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\nFor the 2013 match (October 15), the score is 2-0 again for Chile against Ecuador. Wait, that's also a win with a score of 2-0. But the result in the table shows the result as 2-1? That seems confusing. Let me check: the 'result' column has \"2 - 1\" for October 15, 2013. That doesn't match the score which is 2-0. Maybe it's a typo or something. But since the score directly shows the points scored by Chile as 2 in both matches, perhaps I should focus on that.\n\nWait, no, wait: The 'score' column shows for October 15, 2013, \"2 - 0.\" So, if Chile won with a score of 2-0, then their score is 2 points. In the previous match in 2011, they scored 3-0, so that's also 3 points.\n\nBut wait, the 'result' for October 15 shows 2-1, which doesn't make sense if the score is 2-0. Maybe it's a mistake, but I'll proceed with the 'score' column as accurate because that directly reflects the points scored by the winning team.\n\nSo, in 2011, Chile scored 3 points (from 3-0), and in 2013, they scored 2 points (from 2-0). The claim says \"more points\" in 2011 than 2013. So, 3 is more than 2, which would make the statement TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to ensure that both matches are indeed the same competition or related. Both are under \"2014 FIFA World Cup qualification,\" so they're part of the same qualifying process. Therefore, comparing these two makes sense.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells. The 'score' column is definitely needed for both rows. So, for each match (row), I need to get their score.\n\nLooking at row indices: October 11, 2011 is index 2, and October 15, 2013 is index 4. Wait, no: the table has five rows with indices 0 to 4. Let me check:\n\nRow 0: June 15, 2008\nRow 1: same date as row 0\nRow 2: May 29, 2009\nRow 3: October 11, 2011 (index 3)\nRow 4: October 15, 2013 (index 4)\n\nSo, the relevant rows are index 3 and 4.\n\nIn each of these rows, the 'score' column is \"3 - 0\" and \"2 - 0.\" So, that's where the points come from.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be at row indices 3 and 4, both in the 'score' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the scores of Chile's victories in the 2011 and 2013 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The score for the 2011 match was 3-0, while the 2013 match was 2-0. Since 3 > 2, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the estadio monumental in chile host world cup qualify in both october 2011 and october 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table to find any matches for Estadio Monumental in Chile hosting World Cup qualifiers in October 2011 and October 2013. Let me go through each row.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five entries:\n\n1. June 15, 2008: Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia, scores 0-1 and 0-2 for FIFA World Cup Qualification.\n2. Also on June 15, 2008: Same venue, same scores, same competition.\n3. May 29, 2009: Fukuda Denshi Arena in Japan, friendly match, score 1-1.\n4. October 11, 2011: Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile, scores 3-0 and 4-2 for World Cup Qualification (2014).\n5. October 15, 2013: Same venue, same competition, scores 2-0 and 2-1.\n\nSo, the claim is about Estadio Monumental hosting World Cup qualifiers in both October 2011 and October 2013. From the table, I see that there are entries for both dates mentioned. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"host world cup qualify\" which might be a typo for \"host world cup qualification.\" But looking at the table, in row 4 and 5 under result, it's written as \"2014 fifa world cup qualification,\" so that seems correct.\n\nNow, checking the venues: Estadio Monumental is mentioned in rows 4 and 5. So both October 2011 and October 2013 matches are there. \n\nSo each of these two dates has an entry where Estadio Monumental hosted a World Cup Qualification match. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. For October 11, 2011, the row index is 3 (since it's zero-based), and the columns are date, venue, score, result, competition. So the relevant columns would be venue and competition.

The claim is: \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match be held in Bolivia in May 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll need to check each part of the claim against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. So, I'm interested in the 'date' and 'venue' columns for this claim.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things:\n1. The match was held in Bolivia.\n2. It took place in May 2009.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Date: 15 June 2008\n- Venue: Estadio Hernando Siles, La Paz, Bolivia\n- Competition: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nThis is in Bolivia and in June, so it's not May. Also, the competition here is for 2010, which matches part of the claim, but the date is June instead of May.\n\nSecond row:\nSame as the first, just a different score. Same date and venue. Again, same issue with the date being June.\n\nThird row:\n- Date: 29 May 2009\n- Venue: Fukuda Denchi Arena, Chiba, Japan\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nThis is in May 2009, but the venue is in Japan, not Bolivia. So, even though it's the right month and competition (sort of; friendly isn't a qualification), the location doesn't match.\n\nFourth row:\n- Date: 11 October 2011\n- Venue: Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile\n- Competition: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nNeither the date nor the venue matches the claim. It's in Chile and not May.\n\nFifth row:\n- Date: 15 October 2013\n- Venue: Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile\n- Competition: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nSame as above; doesn't match.\n\nSo, looking through all rows, none of them have a match that was held in Bolivia in May 2009. The closest is the first two rows but they are in June and not the right month for the claim. Therefore, there's no row that matches both the venue (Bolivia) and the date (May 2009).\n\nThe claim mentions \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification,\" which does appear in the table, but paired with the wrong dates and venues.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the ones where the competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\" because that's part of the claim. That includes the first two rows.\n\nBut since neither row matches both the date (May 2009) and venue (Bolivia), the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"in may 2009 a friendly competition take place at the estadio hernando siles , la paz , bolivia that end in a tie score between the competitor.\" \n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table. The claim mentions May 2009, so I should look for any rows with a date in May 2009.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row is June 15, 2008.\n2. Second row is also June 15, 2008.\n3. Third row is May 29, 2009.\n4. Fourth row is October 11, 2011.\n5. Fifth row is October 15, 2013.\n\nSo the third row is May 29, 2009, which is in May 2009. That seems relevant because the claim mentions May 2009. So that's one cell to mark as relevant.\n\nNext, the venue mentioned in the claim is Estadio Hernando Siles, La Paz, Bolivia. I need to check if this venue corresponds to any row for May 29, 2009. Looking at the table, the third row indeed has \"fukuda denshi arena , chiba , japan\" as the venue. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, the claim says Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia, but the table entry for May 29, 2009 is at Fukuda Denchi Arena in Chiba, Japan. So there's a discrepancy here. That means the venue doesn't match what the claim states.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The third row: date is May 29, 2009, venue is Fukuda Denchi Arena in Chiba, Japan. The claim says Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia. So they don't match. Therefore, the venue doesn't align with the claim.\n\nSo now, let's look at the score and result. The claim mentions a friendly competition that ended in a tie score. The third row has a score of 1-1 and result of 1-1 as well. That does indicate a tie.\n\nBut wait, the venue is different. So even though the score matches, the venue doesn't. Therefore, the claim's venue information isn't supported by the table data for May 2009.\n\nAdditionally, let me check if there are any other rows that might be relevant. The first two rows are in June 2008 and refer to Bolivia, but the competition is World Cup qualification, not friendly. The fourth and fifth rows are in October 2011 and 2013, which don't relate to May 2009.\n\nSo putting this together: The claim states that in May 2009, a friendly competition took place at Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia with a tied score. However, the table shows that on May 29, 2009, a friendly match occurred at Fukuda Denchi Arena in Chiba, Japan, which ended in a tie (1-1). But since the venue doesn't match, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the venue in the third row. Let me check again: The third row's venue is \"fukuda denshi arena , chiba , japan\". Yes, that's correct. So it's not Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia as stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while a friendly match with a tie score occurred in May 2009, it wasn't at the venue specified. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in May 2009, a friendly competition took place at Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia with a tied score.

Since the venue doesn't match, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells**: The cell for May 29, 2009, as it's the only relevant date but doesn't support the venue and thus the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the estadio monumental be locate in santiago , chile and host friendly match in 2011.\" Breaking it down, the claim has two main points:\n\n1. Estadio Monumental is located in Santiago, Chile.\n2. It hosted a friendly match in 2011.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to verify these points.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. The rows are individual matches or events. I need to find if there's any row that mentions Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile and a friendly match around 2011.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0:** Venue is Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia. Not relevant.\n- **Row 1:** Same venue as Row 0. Still not relevant.\n- **Row 2:** Venue is Fukuda Denshi Arena in Japan. No match in Chile here.\n- **Row 3:** Venue is Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile. The date is October 11, 2011. The competition was FIFA World Cup qualification, but the score is 3-0 and result 4-2. This isn't a friendly match; it's a qualifying match.\n- **Row 4:** Same venue as Row 3, same date format, but the date is October 15, 2013. Again, competition is World Cup qualification, so not a friendly.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. The claim mentions \"host friendly match in 2011.\" Looking back at Row 3, it's a qualifying match, not friendly. So there's no friendly match in 2011 according to the table. But maybe I should check if any other row refers to Estadio Monumental and a friendly event.\n\nLooking again, only Rows 3 and 4 refer to Estadio Monumental. Both are in 2011 and 2013, respectively, but both are qualifying matches. There's no row that mentions a friendly match in 2011 at this venue.\n\nWait another thought: The claim says \"host friendly match in 2011.\" So I need an entry where the competition is 'friendly' and the date is around 2011. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 2 has a friendly match on May 29, 2009, but it's in Japan.\n- In the table provided, there's no friendly match at Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile in 2011.\n\nSo the claim seems to be incorrect because there is no such event in the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the dates and competitions. Row 3 has a date of October 11, 2011, but it's a qualifying match for the 2014 World Cup. The next friendly match in Santiago would have to be another year. Since none of the entries for Estadio Monumental mention a friendly match around 2011, the claim is definitely not supported.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are only those that confirm Estadio Monumental's location and any related matches. But since there's no friendly match in 2011 as per the table, the main point of the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some data about soccer matches, and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"More points were scored by the winning team in the 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia than in the 2013 match.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n- There are two matches being compared: one from 2011 and another from 2013.\n- Both are World Cup qualification matches, specifically for Bolivia.\n- The claim is about the points (or goals) scored by the winning team in each match.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the relevant rows and columns that can verify this claim. \n\nLet me go through the table row by row:\n\n1. **15 June 2008**: This seems to be an early qualifying match, but the claim is about 2011 and 2013 matches.\n2. **29 May 2009**: Another date that doesn't fit 2011 or 2013. Maybe irrelevant unless it's a typo, but I'll check later.\n3. **11 October 2011**: This seems to match the 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia.\n4. **15 October 2013**: This matches the 2013 World Cup qualification match in Chile? Wait, no\u2014Chile is the venue here. But the claim mentions Bolivia, so maybe I need to see if this is about Bolivia's matches.\n\nWait a minute. Let me check the venues:\n- For 11 October 2011: Venue is Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile.\n- For 15 October 2013: Same venue but different date.\n\nSo both these entries are from Chile, not Bolivia. That might be a problem because the claim refers to matches in Bolivia. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking again at the table:\n\nRow 0: Venue is Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia\u2014this seems like a Bolivia match.\nRows 1 and beyond have different venues, possibly not related to Bolivia.\n\nSo maybe the 2011 and 2013 matches are both in Chile? That doesn't fit the claim about Bolivia. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check:\n\n- The first two rows (15 June 2008) are for Bolivia matches because the venue is in Bolivia.\n- Then, starting from row 2 (29 May 2009), the venue shifts to Japan and Chile.\n\nSo the relevant rows for Bolivia are the first two, but they don't have the later years mentioned in the claim. The 2011 and 2013 matches are in Chile.\n\nHmm, that suggests there might be a mistake in the table or perhaps I misread it. Wait, no\u2014the claim is about \"the 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia\" and \"the 2013 match.\" So maybe in the table, there's only one Bolivia match in 2008, but the claim refers to two matches (2011 and 2013) in Bolivia.\n\nBut looking at the table again, I don't see any rows for 2011 or 2013 with venue in Bolivia. The 2008 row is the only one with Bolivia, which doesn't align with the claim about 2011 and 2013.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table has a mistake, and the 2011 and 2013 matches are actually in Chile but mistakenly labeled as Bolivia. That would make the claim incorrect because the data isn't there.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each column more carefully. The claim mentions \"more points by the winning team.\" So I need to find which rows have a winning team's score that is higher than another match.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 15 June 2008: score is 0-1 and 0-2. Wait, two entries for the same date? Maybe it's two matches on the same day against different teams.\n- The result column shows 0-2, which probably means Bolivia lost both games.\n\nThen in 29 May 2009: score is 1-1, so a draw.\n\nIn 11 October 2011: score is 3-0 and result is 4-2. Hmm, the result seems higher than the score. Not sure how points are calculated here\u2014maybe it's goals for and against?\n\nWait, maybe \"score\" refers to goals scored by each team, and \"result\" might be the aggregate or something else.\n\nBut I'm not entirely clear. Let me think differently. The claim is about points scored by the winning team in 2011 vs. 2013 Bolivia matches.\n\nSo I need to find two rows: one for 2011 and another for 2013, both in Bolivia, where the winning team's score (probably their goals) is higher in 2011 than in 2013.\n\nBut looking at the table, there are no entries for 2011 or 2013 with venue in Bolivia. The only Bolivia entry is on 15 June 2008, which doesn't fit the claim's timeline.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is FALSE because the necessary data isn't present in the table to verify the claim. Alternatively, maybe the table has a typo and those matches are actually in Chile, making the comparison invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let me check:\n\n- date: the date of the match.\n- venue: location.\n- score: likely goals for each team, separated by a dash.\n- result: perhaps the match outcome, like aggregate goals or something else.\n- competition: which World Cup qualification it's for.\n\nSo for 11 October 2011, the venue is Chile, not Bolivia. Therefore, that row doesn't apply to Bolivia matches.\n\nSimilarly, 15 October 2013 is also in Chile.\n\nThus, the table has no data for Bolivia matches in 2011 or 2013. Hence, the claim can't be verified because the necessary data isn't present.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the venue names. Let me check again:\n\n- Estadio Hernando Siles is in La Paz, Bolivia.\n- Estadio Monumental is in Santiago, Chile.\n\nSo yes, only the first two entries are in Bolivia, and they're from 2008.\n\nTherefore, the claim refers to matches that don't exist in the table. So the answer should be FALSE because there's no data supporting it.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim do not exist in the provided table as there are no entries for Bolivia in 2011 or 2013. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the estadio monumental in japan host world cup qualify in both october 2011 and october 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is stating. It's saying that Estadio Monumental in Japan hosted World Cup qualifiers in October 2011 and October 2013. So, I need to check the table for any matches that fit these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a match: date, venue, score, result, and competition. The relevant columns here are \"venue\" and \"date,\" as well as the \"competition\" which might provide context about whether it's a World Cup qualification.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if Estadio Monumental in Japan was the venue for matches in October 2011 and October 2013, specifically for World Cup qualifiers.\n\nStarting with row 0: date is June 15, 2008, venue is Estadio Hernando Siles in Bolivia. Not relevant because it's not Japan and not October dates. \n\nRow 1: Same date as row 0, same venue, same competition. Still irrelevant.\n\nRow 2: Date is May 29, 2009, venue is Fukuda Denshi Arena in Chiba, Japan. It's a friendly match, not a World Cup qualifier. So, even though it's in Japan, it doesn't fit the claim because it's not a qualifier and the date isn't October.\n\nRow 3: Date is October 11, 2011, venue is Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile. Competition is 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. This matches the month of October 2011 but the venue is in Chile, not Japan. So, this doesn't support the claim either.\n\nRow 4: Date is October 15, 2013, venue is again Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile. Competition is still 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. Again, same issue as row 3\u2014venue is in Chile, not Japan.\n\nWait a second, I just realized that the claim mentions \"estadio monumental in japan,\" but looking at the table, all entries for Estadio Monumental are in Santiago, Chile. There's no entry in Japan. That means the venue in question isn't actually hosting any matches in Japan as per the table data.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because Estadio Monumental wasn't used in Japan during those years for World Cup qualifiers. Instead, it was used in Chile. Also, there are no entries for Estadio Monumental in Japan at all, which further indicates that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Estadio Monumental in Japan hosted matches in October 2011 and 2013, but the table shows these matches took place in Chile.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
