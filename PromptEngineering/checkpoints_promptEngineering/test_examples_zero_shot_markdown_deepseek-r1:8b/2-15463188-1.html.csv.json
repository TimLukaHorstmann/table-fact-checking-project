    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant. Let me start by carefully examining the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"jessica quinone (26) play for far eastern in 2012.\" First, I notice that there might be a typo in the name\u2014\"quinone\" versus \"quinones.\" Looking at the table, the correct last name is Quinones. So that's something to consider.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are: name, position, number, school/club team, season, and acquisition via. Each row corresponds to a different player with their respective details.\n\nNow, focusing on Jessica Quinones. In the table, her name is listed as \"jessica quinones\" (with an 's' at the end). Her position is guard, number 26, school/club team is far eastern, season is 2012, and she was acquired via a rookie draft.\n\nSo, breaking down the claim: It says Jessica Quinone plays for Far Eastern in 2012. The first thing I spot is the typo in her last name. The table has \"quinones,\" so if the claim uses \"quinone\" without the 's,' that's already a discrepancy. However, sometimes names might be written differently or misspelled in claims, but it's worth checking.\n\nLooking at the relevant columns for the claim: The team is mentioned as \"far eastern.\" In the table, under school/club team, Jessica Quinones is indeed listed with far eastern. The season is 2012, which matches the table. Her number is 26, and she was a rookie draft pick.\n\nBut wait, the name in the claim is \"jessica quinone,\" whereas the table has \"jessica quinones.\" That's a difference in spelling. However, sometimes names might be written with or without an 's' depending on usage. I need to check if that's a significant error.\n\nAssuming that the name should have an 's,' then the claim is using the incorrect version. But perhaps it's acceptable to ignore the 's' because sometimes people drop the 's' in casual use, especially in claims or casual contexts. So maybe the typo isn't a deal-breaker here.\n\nNow, checking all other aspects: Position is guard\u2014table says guard. Number 26\u2014matches. Season 2012\u2014matches. School/club team far eastern\u2014matches.\n\nSo, despite the potential typo in her last name, all the other details match perfectly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because Jessica Quinones (with an 's') did play for Far Eastern in 2012 as a guard with number 26 via rookie draft.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"number\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"season\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"in 2012, julieta makidato play for cebu.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There's a column called \"name,\" which includes the player's name. Another column is \"school / club team,\" and under that, it says \"cebu\" for one of the entries. The row in question should have the name \"julieta makidato.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Name is \"jhofel morales.\" Not the person we're looking for.\n2. **Second Row**: Name is \"julieta makidato.\" This matches.\n3. **Third Row**: Hermies Ploma, not relevant.\n4. **Fourth Row**: Judy-Ann Ramirez, not relevant.\n5. **Fifth Row**: Rosalyn Limos, nope.\n6. **Sixth Row**: Regine Galabo, no match.\n7. **Seventh Row**: Joyce Guio, not her.\n8. **Eighth Row**: Elaine Francisco, doesn't fit.\n9. **Ninth Row**: Jessica Quinones, nope.\n\nSo the relevant row is the second one, with name \"julieta makidato.\"\n\nNow, checking the columns related to the claim: The \"school / club team\" column has \"cebu\" for this row. That's exactly what the claim states\u2014she played for cebu in 2012.\n\nThe other relevant columns are \"name,\" which is \"julieta makidato,\" and \"season,\" which is 2012. So all the necessary cells are verified to support the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if \"julieta makidato\" played for \"cebu\" in 2012. The table confirms her name, position, number, school/club team as cebu, and season as 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"in the 2012 season jessica quinone (26) play for a team called mcgill.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: name, position, number, school/club team, season, and acquisition via. Each row represents a player with their details.\n\nI need to check if Jessica Quinones is in the table, her number is 26, she played for McGill in the 2012 season. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- The name of the player is listed as \"jessica quinones.\"\nWait, the claim has \"Jessica Quinone,\" but the table has \"jessica quinones.\" Is that a typo? But regardless, I should check for an exact match in the name.\n\nNext, checking the number: In row 8 (if we start from 0), the number is 26. So that's correct.\n\nThe school/club team column for that row is \"mcgill.\" That matches the claim.\n\nSeason is 2012, which also aligns with the claim.\n\nSo all three relevant columns\u2014name, number, and school\u2014are matching the claim.
