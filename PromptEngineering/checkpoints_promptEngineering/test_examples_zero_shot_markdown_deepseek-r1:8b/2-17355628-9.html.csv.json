    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the Oklahoma City Thunder is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the oklahoma city thunder do not break 100 point at all during march 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that in March 2009, the Thunder didn't have any games where they scored 100 points or more. So my job is to check each game in March 2009 and see if their score was below 100.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The key here is the 'score' column because that's what determines if they broke 100 points.\n\nI'll go through each row to extract the relevant information. Let's list out the games in March 2009:\n\n- Game 60: March 2 vs Dallas. Score: 96-87 (OT). So total points for Thunder: 96.\n- Game 61: March 4 vs Washington. Score: 88-83 (OT). Thunder scored 88.\n- Game 62: March 7 vs New Orleans. Score: 90-108. Thunder scored 90.\n- Game 63: March 8 vs Philadelphia. Score: 89-74 (OT). Thunder scored 89.\n- Game 64: March 10 vs Sacramento. Score: 99-98 (OT). Thunder scored 99.\n- Game 65: March 11 vs Denver. Score: 99-112 (OT). Thunder scored 99.\n- Game 66: March 14 vs Phoenix. Score: 95-106 (OT). Thunder scored 95.\n- Game 67: March 16 vs San Antonio. Score: 78-76 (OT). Thunder scored 78.\n- Game 68: March 18 vs Chicago. Score: 96-103 (OT). Thunder scored 96.\n- Game 69: March 20 vs Utah. Score: 94-101 (OT). Thunder scored 94.\n- Game 70: March 22 vs Minnesota. Score: 97-90 (OT). Thunder scored 97.\n- Game 71: March 24 vs LA Lakers. Score: 89-107 (OT). Thunder scored 89.\n- Game 72: March 27 vs Toronto. Score: 96-112 (OT). Thunder scored 96.\n- Game 73: March 29 vs Boston. Score: 84-103 (OT). Thunder scored 84.\n- Game 74: March 31 vs San Antonio. Score: 96-95 (OT). Thunder scored 96.\n\nNow, I'll check each of these scores to see if any are 100 or above. \n\nLooking through the list:\n- All scores for Thunder are under 100. The highest is 99 in games 64 and 65, and then it goes down from there.\n\nSince none of the games have the Thunder scoring 100 points or more, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "claim": "the oklahoma city thunder defeat the san antonio spur 2 time in march of 2009",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the Oklahoma City Thunder defeat the San Antonio Spurs 2 times in March of 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that the Oklahoma City Thunder (then known as the Thunder) defeated the San Antonio Spurs twice during March 2009. So, I need to check if there are two games in March 2009 where the Thunder won against the Spurs.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, teams involved, score, etc. The team names in the 'team' column are given as \"dallas\", \"washington\", \"new orleans\", etc. I need to map these to their actual NBA team names because Oklahoma City Thunder might be referred to by another name here.\n\nWait, in the table, for row 60, the team is \"dallas\", but that's likely a typo or shorthand. The game was between Dallas and Washington. Wait, no, looking again, perhaps each cell is the away and home team? Or maybe it's listed as the game's location. Hmm.\n\nWait, the 'game' column has numbers from 60 to 74, which are likely game IDs. The 'team' column lists the teams involved, but it's written in lowercase like \"dallas\", \"washington\", etc. So perhaps each row is a game where one team is the away and the other is the home. But for our purpose, we need to identify games where Oklahoma City Thunder (OKC) played against San Antonio Spurs (SA), and OKC won two of those games in March 2009.\n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see any entries for March 2009. Let me check the dates:\n\nLooking at the 'date' column: The earliest date is March 2, 2009 (game 60), and the latest is March 31, 2009 (game 74). So all games are in March 2009.\n\nNow, let's look for any games where Oklahoma City Thunder played against San Antonio Spurs. But wait, looking at the 'team' column:\n\nGame 60: Dallas vs Washington\nGame 61: Washington vs New Orleans\nGame 62: New Orleans vs OKC (Thunder)? Wait, no. The team names are \"new orleans\", \"philadelphia\", etc., but I don't see Oklahoma City Thunder listed as a team name in the 'team' column.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me list out all the teams involved:\n\nLooking at the 'team' column for each game:\n- Game 60: dallas vs washington\n- Game 61: washington vs new orleans\n- Game 62: new orleans vs philadelphia\n- Game 63: philadelphia vs oklahoma city (Thunder)\nWait, is that correct? Because in game 63, the team is listed as \"philadelphia\" and \"oklahoma city\". So perhaps the Thunder are sometimes referred to by their full name.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about Oklahoma City Thunder defeating San Antonio Spurs. Looking through the table, do we have any games where both teams include OKC and SA?\n\nLooking at each row's 'team' column:\n\nGame 60: Dallas vs Washington\nGame 61: Washington vs New Orleans\nGame 62: New Orleans vs Philadelphia\nGame 63: Philadelphia vs Oklahoma City (Thunder)\nGame 64: Sacramento vs Oklahoma City (Thunder)\nGame 65: Denver vs Oklahoma City (Thunder)\n... and so on.\n\nWait, but in the table, I don't see any games where San Antonio Spurs are playing. The 'team' column shows teams like Dallas, Washington, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Sacramento, Denver, etc., but not San Antonio Spurs.\n\nSo perhaps the San Antonio Spurs aren't included in this table or they're referred to differently. Alternatively, maybe the team names in the 'team' column are abbreviations or misspellings.\n\nWait, let me check each game's 'team' entries again:\n\nLooking for \"san antonio\" or \"spurs\" in any of the team columns. Scanning through, I don't see any mention of San Antonio Spurs. So maybe this table doesn't include games involving the Spurs. If that's the case, then there are zero games where OKC Thunder played against SA Spurs in March 2009.\n\nBut wait, perhaps \"san antonio\" is abbreviated as \"sa\" or something else. Let me check again. The 'team' entries are:\n\n- dallas\n- washington\n- new orleans\n- philadelphia\n- oklahoma city\n- sacramento\n- denver\n\nNo San Antonio Spurs mentioned.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table that OKC Thunder played against San Antonio Spurs in March 2009. So the claim is likely FALSE because there are zero games where they defeated each other twice, as there were no such matchups in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the San Antonio Spurs two times in March 2009. However, upon reviewing the provided table, there are no entries indicating any games involving both teams in March 2009. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "russell westbrook lead the oklahoma city thunder in assist 10 time during march of 2009",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"Russell Westbrook led the Oklahoma City Thunder in assists 10 times during March of 2009.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's about Russell Westbrook (RW) and his performance in March 2009 for the OKC Thunder. Specifically, it's talking about him leading the team in assists 10 times that month.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game, with various statistics like points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The relevant columns for this claim would be the ones related to assists. In the table, there's a column named \"high assists\" which seems to list the player with the highest assists in that game.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Russell Westbrook leading in assists 10 times, not necessarily the highest in each game. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. If the high assists column lists the player who had the most assists in each game, then seeing how often Westbrook was listed there would indicate how many times he led.\n\nLooking at the table from row 60 onwards:\n\n- Row 60: High assists is Russell Westbrook (10). So that's one time.\n- Row 61: High rebounds and assists both are RW (10), so that's another assist lead.\n- Row 62: High assists is Malik Rose (5), not Westbrook. So no.\n- Row 63: High assists is Russell Westbrook (5). That's three times.\n- Row 64: High assists is Russell Westbrook (4). Fourth time.\n- Row 65: High assists is Earl Watson (7). No.\n- Row 66: High assists is Russell Westbrook (7). Fifth time.\n- Row 67: High assists is Chucky Atkins (3). No.\n- Row 68: High assists is Russell Westbrook (6). Sixth time.\n- Row 69: High assists is Kevin Durant (5). No.\n- Row 70: High assists is Russell Westbrook (10). Seventh time.\n- Row 71: High assists is Russell Westbrook (6). Eighth time.\n- Row 72: High assists is Russell Westbrook (5). Ninth time.\n- Row 73: High assists is Kyle Weaver (7). No.\n- Row 74: High assists is Russell Westbrook (10). Tenth time.\n\nSo, in total, there are 10 instances where Westbrook led the team in high assists during March of those years. Since the claim specifies \"during March of 2009,\" but looking at the table, the dates range from March 2 to March 31, which is within March 2009, assuming the year isn't specified beyond that.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't specify the exact year. The games are labeled as 60 to 74, but without knowing the years those correspond to, it's tricky. However, since all the dates in the table are within March, and the claim refers to March 2009, I think it's safe to assume that these are from that specific year.\n\nSo, if there are exactly 10 instances where Westbrook led in assists, then the claim is TRUE. Therefore, I need to point out those 10 rows as relevant cells.\n\nI'll list each occurrence where \"high assists\" equals Russell Westbrook (10 times). Each time it happens, it's a relevant cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"19136 fan attend oklahoma city thunder game at the ford center on 4 separate occasion during march 2009.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions that a fan attended four games at Ford Center in March 2009. So I need to find cells related to attendance numbers for each of those games and see if any of them have an attendance figure matching 19,136.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check if the 'location attendance' column has 19,136. Let's go step by step:\n\n- Row 60: Ford Center, 18,527 \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 61: Ford Center, 18,576 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 62: New Orleans Arena, 18,114 \u2013 different venue.\n- Row 63: Ford Center, 18,738 \u2013 close but not 19,136.\n- Row 64: Arco Arena, 10,784 \u2013 different location.\n- Row 65: Pepsi Center, 16,186 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 66: US Airways Center, 18,422 \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 67: Ford Center, 19,136 \u2013 this one matches. So at least one game had 19,136 attendees.\n- Row 68: Ford Center, 19,136 \u2013 another match.\n- Row 69: Ford Center, 19,136 \u2013 third match.\n- Row 70: Target Center, 18,561 \u2013 different venue.\n- Rows beyond that don't seem to have the same attendance number.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"on 4 separate occasion.\" So if there are three games with 19,136 attendees, that doesn't reach four. Did I miss any? Let me check again:\n\nRow 67: March 16 \u2013 Ford Center, 19,136.\nRow 68: March 18 \u2013 same venue and attendance.\nRow 69: March 20 \u2013 same as well.\n\nSo three instances where the attendance was 19,136 at Ford Center. The claim mentions four occasions. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are only three games with that attendance number, not four.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list out all rows:\n\nRows 67,68,69: each has Ford Center and attendance of 19,136. That's three games.\n\nSo the claim says four times, but in reality, it's three times. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a fan attended four games at Ford Center during March 2009 with an attendance of 19,136. By checking each row, only three games match this number. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"Kevin Durant led the Oklahoma City Thunder in points for 6 games in a row in March 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each game in March 2009 to see where Kevin Durant was playing. From the table, the games are numbered from 60 to 74. Let me check when OKC Thunder was involved.\n\nLooking at the 'team' column: game 60 is Dallas, 61 Washington, 62 New Orleans, 63 Philadelphia, 64 Sacramento, 65 Denver, 66 Phoenix, 67 San Antonio, 68 Chicago, 69 Utah, 70 Minnesota, 71 LA Lakers, 72 Toronto, 73 Boston, and 74 San Antonio. I don't see any game where the team is Oklahoma City Thunder. So maybe Kevin Durant wasn't with OKC during these games? Or perhaps I need to check other months.\n\nWait, the claim mentions March 2009, so I should only consider games in March. Looking again at the 'date' column: most of the dates are March (2,4,7,8,10,11,14,16,18,20,22,24,27,29,31). But none of these are for OKC Thunder; all seem to be other teams like Dallas, Washington, etc. So perhaps Kevin Durant wasn't with the Thunder yet in 2009? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding which team he was with.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't have any games for the Thunder in March 2009, so maybe the claim is incorrect because there are no relevant games to verify his performance as a Thunder player that month. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported because there's no data on OKC games where Durant would have led them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any of these games were against the Thunder, but that doesn't matter for points scored by Durant. The key is whether he was leading the Thunder in consecutive games in March 2009. If none of the games listed are Thunder games, then there's no data to support the claim.\n\nSo I think the answer should be FALSE because there are no relevant cells that show Kevin Durant leading the Thunder in six straight games in March 2009.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the oklahoma city thunder break 100 point 5 time during march\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the claim. It seems to suggest that the Oklahoma City Thunder scored 100 points in a game during March, and this happened five times. So I need to check if there are multiple games where they scored at least 100 points in March.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with details like date, team, score, etc. I'll go through each row and see if any game has a score above 100.\n\nStarting from row 60: The score is w 96 - 87 (ot). That's 96 points for Dallas, but it doesn't specify the Thunder's points. Wait, actually, in the \"score\" column, I think it shows both teams' scores separated by 'w' or 'l'. So for row 60, the score is Dallas: 96 and opponent:87 (Thunder, I assume). So Thunder scored 87.\n\nRow 61: Washington beat them 88-83 (ot), so Thunder scored 83.\n\nRow 62: Lost 90-108. Thunder's points are 108? Wait, no. The score column is structured as \"w X - Y (ot)\" or \"l X - Y (ot)\". So for row 60, it's Dallas scoring 96 and the Thunder 87. Similarly, in row 62, New Orleans scored 90-108, so Thunder scored 108? Wait, no. The team is Oklahoma City Thunder, so if they are playing against New Orleans, then \"l 90 - 108 (ot)\" would mean the Thunder lost with 108 points. So in that game, the Thunder scored 108.\n\nRow 63: Philadelphia vs Thunder, score w 89-74. So Thunder won, scoring 89, opponent 74.\n\nRow 64: Sacramento vs Thunder, w 99-98. So Thunder scored 99.\n\nRow 65: Denver vs Thunder, l 99-112. So Thunder scored 99.\n\nRow 66: Phoenix vs Thunder, l 95-106. Thunder scored 95? Wait, no, if it's an 'l', then the first number is the opponent's score. So Phoenix scored 95, Thunder scored 106 and lost in overtime.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The \"score\" column shows \"w X - Y (ot)\" or similar, where the first team is the winner. For example, row 60: Dallas vs Thunder, w 96-87 (ot). So Dallas won with 96, Thunder scored 87.\n\nSimilarly, row 64: Sacramento vs Thunder, w 99-98. So Thunder won, scoring 99.\n\nRow 65: Denver vs Thunder, l 99-112. So Thunder lost, their score is 99.\n\nSo in each game, the first number after 'w' or 'l' is the opponent's score if it's a win or loss, respectively. So for row 62, \"l 90 - 108 (ot)\", the Thunder lost with 108 points, so they scored 108.\n\nNow, let me list out how many times the Thunder scored 100+ in March:\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n- Row 64: Thunder scored 99.\n- Any others?\n\nWait, row 70: They won 97-90 (ot). So their score is 97.\nRow 72: Lost 96-112. Their score is 96.\nRow 74: They scored 95 in a loss.\n\nHmm, I might have missed some. Let me go through each game again.\n\nRow 60: Thunder scored 87 - no.\nRow 61: 83 - no.\nRow 62: 108 - yes, that's over 100.\nRow 63: 89 - no.\nRow 64: 99 - just under.\nRow 65: 99 - no.\nRow 66: 106 - that's over 100.\nWait, row 66: Phoenix scored 95, Thunder scored 106. So that's a win with 106.\n\nSo in March, the Thunder had at least one game where they scored 100+ points. Specifically, rows 62 and 66, where they scored 108 and 106 respectively.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"break 100 point 5 time during march\". So does that mean five times? Or does it mean breaking 100 once, with 5 times reaching over 100?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misphrased, but I think it's saying they scored 100 points five times in March. Let me check each game:\n\nLooking at each Thunder game's score in March:\n\nRow 62: 108\nRow 66: 106\nIs there any other game where Thunder scored over 100?\n\nLet me see row 60: 87, 61:83, 63:89, 64:99, 65:99, 70:97, 72:96, 74:95. So only rows 62 and 66 have Thunder scores above 100.\n\nThat's two times, not five. Therefore, the claim that they broke 100 points five times is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted or missed some games. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking for any game where the Thunder scored over 100:\n\nRow 60: 87\n61:83\n62:108 - yes\n63:89\n64:99\n65:99\n66:106 - yes\n67? Wait, no, only up to row 74.\n\nWait, rows go from 60 to 74, but not all are in March. The last game is row 74, which is on March 26th (assuming the data goes up to March). So in March, any games beyond row 62 and 66?\n\nNo, only two games where Thunder scored over 100.\n\nSo the claim says \"break 100 point 5 time during march\", which would mean scoring 100 or more five times. But according to the table, it's only twice. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each Thunder game in March for points scored over 100.\n\n- **Row 62**: Thunder scores 108 (over 100).\n- **Row 66**: Thunder scores 106 (over 100).\n\nOnly two instances where the Thunder scored over 100 points. Therefore, the claim that they did so five times is incorrect.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the Oklahoma City Thunder defeat the San Antonio Spurs three times in March of 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by breaking down the claim and understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the team names: the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs. Looking at the 'team' column in the table, I see that the Thunder's games are listed against various opponents, including the Spurs. Wait, but in this table, I need to check if there were three games where the Thunder defeated the Spurs specifically in March 2009.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"defeat the San Antonio Spurs three times.\" So, I'm looking for three instances where the Thunder beat the Spurs in March 2009.\n\nLooking at the 'game' column, each game has a number and a date. The dates provided in the table go from March 2 to March 31, 2009 (since the last game is on March 31). So, I should focus only on games that occurred in March 2009.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 60: March 2 vs Dallas. Thunder won. Opponent is Dallas, not Spurs.\nRow 61: March 4 vs Washington. Won. Opponent is Washington, not Spurs.\nRow 62: March 7 vs New Orleans. Lost. Not relevant.\nRow 63: March 8 vs Philadelphia. Won. Not against Spurs.\nRow 64: March 10 vs Sacramento. Won. Sacramento isn't Spurs.\nRow 65: March 11 vs Denver. Lost.\nRow 66: March 14 vs Phoenix. Lost.\nRow 67: March 16 vs San Antonio. Thunder won this game, but wait, is it against the Spurs? San Antonio is the Spurs' home city, so yes, San Antonio Spurs are the opponent here.\nRow 68: March 18 vs Chicago. Lost.\nRow 69: March 20 vs Utah. Lost.\nRow 70: March 22 vs Minnesota. Won.\nRow 71: March 24 vs LA Lakers. Lost.\nRow 72: March 27 vs Toronto. Lost.\nRow 73: March 29 vs Boston. Lost.\nRow 74: March 31 vs San Antonio. Thunder won again against the Spurs.\n\nSo, from this table, there are two games where the Thunder defeated the San Antonio Spurs in March 2009: game 67 and game 74.\n\nBut the claim says they defeated them three times in March of 2009. So that's a problem because according to the table, it's only two wins against the Spurs during that month.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me double-check:\n\n- Game 60: Dallas\n- Game 61: Washington\n- Game 62: New Orleans\n- Game 63: Philadelphia\n- Game 64: Sacramento\n- Game 65: Denver\n- Game 66: Phoenix\n- Game 67: San Antonio (Spurs)\n- Game 68: Chicago\n- Game 69: Utah\n- Game 70: Minnesota\n- Game 71: LA Lakers\n- Game 72: Toronto\n- Game 73: Boston\n- Game 74: San Antonio (Spurs)\n\nYes, only two games where Thunder beat Spurs. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's only two times, not three.\n\nAlso, checking the dates, all these are in March 2009, as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the San Antonio Spurs three times in March 2009. However, upon reviewing the provided table, there are only two such games (game numbers 67 and 74) where the Thunder won against the Spurs during that month.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Teams:** Focus on Thunder vs Spurs.\n2. **Scan Each Game in March 2009:** Check each row's date to ensure it falls within March 2009.\n3. **Count Victories Over Spurs:** Only two instances found (game 67 and 74).\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim of three victories is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"19136 fan attend san antonio spur game at the air canada centre 4 seperate occasion during march 2009\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Total fans attending**: 19,136\n2. **Teams involved**: San Antonio Spurs\n3. ** Venues**: Air Canada Centre (in Toronto)\n4. **Number of occurrences**: 4 separate occasions\n5. **Timeframe**: March 2009\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nI need to check if there are four games where San Antonio Spurs played at Air Canada Centre in March 2009 with 19,136 attendees each time. But wait, the table starts from game 60 on March 2 and goes up to game 74 on March 31. So, March 2009 would correspond to games 60-74.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row:\n\n- Game 60: Dallas at Ford Center, attendance 18,527\n- Game 61: Washington at Ford Center, attendance 18,576\n- Game 62: New Orleans at New Orleans Arena, attendance 18,114\n- Game 63: Philadelphia at Ford Center, attendance 18,738\n- Game 64: Sacramento at Arco Arena, attendance 10,784\n- Game 65: Denver at Pepsi Center, attendance 16,186\n- Game 66: Phoenix at US Airways Center, attendance 18,422\n- Game 67: San Antonio at Ford Center, attendance 19,136\n- Game 68: Chicago at Ford Center, attendance 19,136\n- Game 69: Utah at Ford Center, attendance 19,136\n- Game 70: Minnesota at Target Center, attendance 18,561\n- Game 71: LA Lakers at Ford Center, attendance 19,136\n- Game 72: Toronto at Air Canada Centre, attendance 17,127\n- Game 73: Boston at TD Banknorth Garden, attendance 18,624\n- Game 74: San Antonio at AT&T Center, attendance 18,797\n\nFrom this list, I can see that the San Antonio Spurs played multiple games at Ford Center (games 67, 68, 69) and at AT&T Center (game 74). They also played against Toronto at Air Canada Centre (game 72).\n\nWait, but looking closely, game 72 is Toronto playing the Spurs at Air Canada Centre on March 27. The claim mentions attending a Spurs game at Air Canada Centre four times in March 2009. From the table, there's only one game where Spurs played at Air Canada Centre (game 72). So that doesn't add up to four.\n\nAdditionally, the total attendance for each of these games varies. For example, game 67 has 19,136 attendees, same as games 68, 69, and 71. However, game 74 is at AT&T Center with 18,797, which is slightly less but close. The claim mentions attending four separate occasions, not necessarily the same number of attendees each time.\n\nBut the attendance for San Antonio Spurs games at Air Canada Centre (game 72) was only 17,127. Also, in game 67, they were playing against Philadelphia at Ford Center with attendance 18,738, which is close but not exactly 19,136. However, I think that the total attendance might be referring to all games combined, but looking back, each game's attendance is listed as per row.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"19136 fan attend san antonio spur game at the air canada centre\". So it's about 19,136 fans attending a single Spurs game at Air Canada Centre. But in the table, I don't see any San Antonio Spurs games at Air Canada Centre with attendance around 19,136.\n\nLooking again: Game 72 was Toronto vs. Spurs at Air Canada Centre on March 27 with attendance 17,127, which is less than 19,136. There's no game where Spurs were playing at Air Canada Centre with 19,136 attendees. So the claim might be incorrect because either the number of attendees or the venue doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the total over four games is 19136? But that would require each game having about 4784 attendees on average, which isn't matching any single game's attendance. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that 19,136 fans attended each of four separate Spurs games at Air Canada Centre during March 2009.\n\nBut looking through the table, San Antonio Spurs played only once at Air Canada Centre (game 72), so they can't have four occasions there in March 2009. Therefore, the claim is false because there's only one game at Air Canada Centre involving Spurs, not four.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"Russell Westbrook led the San Antonio Spurs in assists 10 times during March 2009.\" \n\nI'll start by looking at each part of this statement to see which parts might be true or false based on the table provided. The table lists games from game 60 to 74, with various details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nThe claim mentions Russell Westbrook leading the Spurs in assists 10 times during March 2009. So I need to check if there are any records of Russell Westbrook playing for the San Antonio Spurs around that time and how many assists he had.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that each row corresponds to a game, and the columns include 'team', 'location attendance', etc. The 'assists' column shows the number of assists by the player, but it doesn't specify who scored them. Wait, actually, no\u2014the high points, rebounds, and assists are listed as individual stats, so I think they refer to the player(s) with the highest points, rebounds, or assists for that game.\n\nSo in each game, under 'high assists', we have a value, which is the number of assists by the player(s) who had the most assists in that game. The claim says Russell Westbrook led them 10 times, so I need to see if in any games during March 2009 (assuming the data corresponds to 2009), Westbrook was the one with the highest assists.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 60: Dallas vs Washington. High assists: Russell Westbrook (10)\n- Game 61: Washington vs New Orleans. High assists: Russell Westbrook (8)\n- Game 62: New Orleans vs Philadelphia. High assists: Malik Rose (5)\n- Game 63: Philadelphia vs Sacramento. High assists: Russell Westbrook (4)\n- Game 64: Sacramento vs Denver. High rebounds: Nenad Krsti\u0107 (15), assists: Russell Westbrook (4)\nWait, game 64's high rebounds and assists are both listed as separate stats. So in that game, Westbrook had 22 points but only 4 assists.\n- Game 65: Denver vs Phoenix. High rebounds: Thabo Sefolosha (9), assists: Earl Watson (7)\n- Game 66: Phoenix vs San Antonio. Assists: Russell Westbrook (7)\n- Game 67: San Antonio vs New Orleans. Assists: Chucky Atkins (3)\n- Game 68: Chicago vs San Antonio. Assists: Russell Westbrook (6)\n- Game 69: Utah vs San Antonio. Assists: Kevin Durant (5)\n- Game 70: Minnesota vs Los Angeles. Assists: Russell Westbrook (10)\n- Game 71: LA Lakers vs San Antonio. Assists: Russell Westbrook (6)\n- Game 72: Toronto vs San Antonio. Assists: Russell Westbrook (5)\n- Game 73: Boston vs San Antonio. Assists: Kyle Weaver (7)\n- Game 74: San Antonio vs Phoenix. Assists: Russell Westbrook (10)\n\nWait, looking at this, the games in March 2009 would be from row 60 to, say, row 70? Wait, let me check the dates. The earliest game is March 2 (game 60), and it goes up to March 31 (game 74). So the entire dataset covers multiple months beyond March. But the claim refers specifically to \"during March 2009,\" which would mean games played in March, so rows 60 through 74.\n\nNow, looking for games where San Antonio Spurs were the opponent, because the claim is about Westbrook leading them. Wait, but in the table, which team is listed as the opponent? Let's see:\n\nLooking at each game's 'team' column:\n\n- Game 60: Dallas\n- Game 61: Washington vs New Orleans (so New Orleans is away)\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The first column seems to be the home team. So for example, game 60: Dallas vs (opponent), which would be the away team? Or perhaps each row shows two teams, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the table, in each row, there are two team names separated by a 'vs'. So, for example:\n\nGame 60: Dallas vs Washington. So Dallas is home, Washington is away?\n\nBut regardless, the claim says \"San Antonio Spurs,\" so I need to find rows where San Antonio Spurs are one of the teams.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- Game 64: Sacramento vs Denver (San Antonio isn't here)\n- Game 67: San Antonio vs New Orleans. Here, San Antonio is home.\n- Game 68: Chicago vs San Antonio. San Antonio is home.\n- Game 69: Utah vs San Antonio. San Antonio is home.\n- Game 74: San Antonio vs Phoenix. San Antonio is home.\n\nSo the relevant games where San Antonio Spurs are playing would be games 67, 68, 69, and 74.\n\nNow, in each of these games, I need to check if Russell Westbrook was the one with the highest assists.\n\nLooking at game 67: High assists by Chucky Atkins (3). So Westbrook didn't lead here.\n\nGame 68: Russell Westbrook had 6 assists. The high would be his 6, so yes.\n\nGame 69: Kevin Durant had 5 assists. So Westbrook didn't lead here.\n\nGame 74: Russell Westbrook had 10 assists. That's the highest in that game.\n\nSo in games where San Antonio is playing:\n\n- Game 68: Westbrook led with 6\n- Game 74: Westbrook led with 10\n\nThat's two times where he led them in assists. But the claim says \"led... in assist 10 times.\" So it seems like the claim is incorrect because according to the table, Westbrook only led them twice (6 and 10) in those games.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all these games are indeed part of March 2009. Since the games go from March 2, 2009 (game 60) to March 31, 2009 (game 74), so yes, they're all within March 2009.\n\nSo Westbrook led San Antonio Spurs in assists on two occasions: game 68 with 6 and game 74 with 10. Therefore, the claim that he led them 10 times is false because it only happened twice, not 10 times.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"led... in assist 10 time,\" which might be a typo for \"times.\" So they probably meant 10 times. Since the table shows two instances where Westbrook had more assists than others, the claim's number (10) doesn't match. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Russell Westbrook led the San Antonio Spurs in assists 10 times during March 2009. By analyzing the provided table, it is clear that Westbrook only led them twice in those games with 6 and 10 assists respectively. Since these are only two instances and not ten, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says: \"nick collison led the oklahoma city thunder in points for 6 games in a row in march of 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which columns and rows in the table are relevant. Let's break down the claim.\n\n- **Nick Collison**: His name appears in the 'high rebounds' column as well as the 'high points' column. So I need to look at both for his performance.\n  \n- **6 games in a row**: This implies a consecutive streak of 6 games where he led in points. I'll need to check if there's a period where he was the top scorer for six games in a row.\n\n- **March 2009**: Looking at the dates, the games listed are from March 2nd to March 31st, which covers late February through March. However, since it's 2009, I need to see if any of these games fall within that timeframe and whether he led points for six consecutive games.\n\nNow, looking at each row:\n\n- **Row 60**: March 2 vs Dallas. Nick Collison isn't listed in high rebounds or points.\n- **Row 61**: March 4 vs Washington. He has 10 rebounds but not in the points column.\n- **Row 62**: March 7 vs New Orleans. He had 8 rebounds and 5 assists, no points listed.\n- **Row 63**: March 8 vs Philadelphia. No mention of him in high points or rebounds.\n- **Row 64**: March 10 vs Sacramento. He has 15 rebounds but no points.\n- **Row 65**: March 11 vs Denver. Thabo Sefolosha is listed for rebounds, Nick isn't mentioned.\n- **Row 66**: March 14 vs Phoenix. No mention of him leading in points or rebounds.\n- **Row 67**: March 16 vs San Antonio. He has 10 rebounds but no points.\n- **Row 68**: March 18 vs Chicago. Again, no points listed for him.\n- **Row 69**: March 20 vs Utah. He's mentioned with 12 rebounds and 5 assists, not points.\n- **Row 70**: March 22 vs Minnesota. He's tied with Durant for points but not leading alone.\n- **Row 71**: March 24 vs LA Lakers. No mention of him in high points or rebounds.\n- **Row 72**: March 27 vs Toronto. He has 7 rebounds with Thabo, no points.\n- **Row 73**: March 29 vs Boston. Jeff Green is listed for points, not Nick.\n- **Row 74**: March 31 vs San Antonio. He's mentioned in rebounds but not points.\n\nWait, looking back at row 70: It says \"kevin durant , russell westbrook (8)\" for high rebounds. So Durant and Westbrook share the lead in rebounds that game. But Nick Collison isn't listed as leading in points there either.\n\nI don't see any row where Nick Collison is leading in both points and rebounds for six consecutive games. The claim mentions \"point score 6 game in a row,\" which likely refers to scoring points, not rebounds. Since Nick isn't consistently listed as the top scorer in points across six games, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
