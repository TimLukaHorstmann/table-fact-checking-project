    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be during week 13.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table lists each week from week 1 to week 14, along with dates, opponents, results, and attendance. My goal is to find out which week's game was played on December 6, 1964.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the 'date' column for December 6, 1964. Let me go row by row:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1964\n- Week 2: September 19, 1964\n- Week 3: September 27, 1964\n- Week 4: October 3, 1964\n- Week 5: October 10, 1964\n- Week 6: October 16, 1964\n- Week 7: October 25, 1964\n- Week 8: November 1, 1964\n- Week 9: November 8, 1964\n- Week 10: November 15, 1964\n- Week 11: November 22, 1964\n- Week 12: November 29, 1964\n- Week 13: December 6, 1964\n- Week 14: December 20, 1964\n\nOkay, so the game on December 6, 1964 is in week 13. Now I need to check if the claim matches this. The claim states that it's during week 13, which aligns exactly with what I found.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look at the table for the game on December 6, 1964 and find it corresponds to week 13.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part means. The claim is about a specific game that took place on December 6, 1964, and it's asking whether this game occurred after week 13.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week (from week 1 to week 14) with corresponding dates. So, I need to find the week number for December 6, 1964. \n\nScrolling through the table, I see that week 13 is on December 6, 1964. That means the game was played during week 13. The claim says it's after week 13, but according to the table, it happened exactly on week 13. So the game wasn't after week 13; it was part of week 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because December 6, 1964, corresponds to week 13, not after it.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we check which cells in the table are relevant. The claim refers to a game on December 6, 1964, and its position relative to week 13.\n\n1. **Identify the specific row for December 6, 1964**: It's week 13.\n2. **Determine if this week is after week 13**: Since it's exactly week 13, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game play on december 2 , 1963 be week 15\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a game played on December 2, 1963, specifically referring to it as \"week 15.\" I need to check if such a week exists in the table and whether that particular game was indeed played on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week (from 1 to 14) with corresponding dates. The columns include week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The dates range from September 13 to December 20, 1964. Notably, the last game in the table is on December 20, which is week 14.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions December 2, 1963, but in the table, the earliest games are in September 1964 and the latest is December 1964. There's no game mentioned for December 2, 1963, in the table. The closest dates after that would be around late November to early December 1964.\n\nAlso, the table only goes up to week 14. If we consider standard NFL seasons, each season has 16 weeks (games). However, the claim refers to \"week 15,\" which might imply a later week number than what's present here. Since the table stops at week 14, there isn't a week 15 in this context.\n\nFurthermore, December 2, 1963, falls before any of the games listed in the table. The earliest game is September 13, 1964, which is week 1. So, December 2, 1963, would be part of a different season or year not covered by this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't align with the provided data because there's no game on December 2, 1963, in week 15 within the scope of this table. The table only covers up to week 14 in 1964.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
