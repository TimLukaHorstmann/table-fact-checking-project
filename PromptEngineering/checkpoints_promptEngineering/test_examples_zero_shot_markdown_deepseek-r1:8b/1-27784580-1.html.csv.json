    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim made about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. It has several columns: Unnamed:0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nThe claim mentions \"arienai kisu.\" Looking at the table, I see that's the romanized title for episode 2. So, the relevant row is ep 2, with a rating of 19.2%.\n\nNext, I need to find the title with the earliest broadcast date. The broadcast dates are May 10, 2010; May 17, 2010; May 24, 2010; May 31, 2010; June 7, 2010; and June 14, 2010. The earliest one is May 10, 2010, which corresponds to ep 1 with a rating of 22.4%.\n\nSo, the claim says that \"arienai kisu\" has a rating that's 3.2% less than this earliest title (ep 1). Let me calculate the difference between ep 2 and ep 1 ratings.\n\nEp 1: 22.4%\nEp 2: 19.2%\n\nThe difference is 22.4 - 19.2 = 3.2%. So, yes, ep 2's rating is exactly 3.2% less than ep 1's.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" So it's referring to the specific title, not just any title. Since the earliest broadcast date is ep 1, and the rating of ep 2 is exactly 3.2% lower, the claim seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are other titles that might have a higher or lower percentage difference. For example, comparing ep 2 to ep 5: 19.2 vs 17.4, which is a 1.8 decrease, not 3.2. Similarly, others don't meet the 3.2% threshold.\n\nSo, the claim holds true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table's data as \"arienai kisu\" has a rating that is exactly 3.2% less than the title with the earliest broadcast date (ep 1).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 7 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like Episode Number, Title (in Japanese), Romanized Title, Translation of Title, Broadcast Date, and Ratings. \n\nFirst, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim.\n\nThe key points in the claim are:\n1. The term \"arienai kisu\" is mentioned.\n2. It should be broadcast 7 days after a title with the earliest broadcast date.\n\nSo, let's parse each part step by step.\n\nStarting with \"arienai kisu\": Looking at the table, I can search for this exact string in the Romanized Title and Translation of Title columns because the claim refers to it as a specific term that should trigger some action (broadcasting 7 days after another episode).\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- ep 1: Title is \"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\" which translates to \"I want you.\" Not matching.\n- ep 2: Romanized title is \"arienai kisu,\" and the translation is \"the unthinkable kiss.\" This matches our term. So, this episode (ep 2) is the one where the claim refers to as \"arienai kisu.\"\n\nNow, the next part of the claim says it should be broadcast 7 days after a title with the earliest broadcast date.\n\nI need to find which episodes have titles that might correspond to this. Wait, but the term being used in ep2 is \"arienai kisu,\" so perhaps the other way around: the claim says that a particular episode (ep2) should be broadcast 7 days after another title's broadcast date, specifically the earliest one.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider if ep2's broadcast date is exactly 7 days after another episode's broadcast date. Let me check all the dates in the table:\n\n- ep1: May 10, 2010\n- ep2: May 17, 2010 (which is 7 days after May 10)\n- ep3: May 24, 2010\n- ep4: May 31, 2010\n- ep5: June 7, 2010\n- ep6: June 14, 2010\n\nSo, if we look at ep2's broadcast date (May 17), it is indeed 7 days after ep1's May 10. So, the claim might be suggesting that \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) is broadcasted 7 days after a title with the earliest broadcast date.\n\nThe term \"earliest broadcast date\" would refer to the episode with the earliest date in the table. Looking at the dates, ep1 has May 10, which is earlier than all others, including ep2's May 17 and onwards. So, the earliest broadcast date is May 10 (ep1).\n\nTherefore, the claim states that \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) is broadcast 7 days after ep1's broadcast. Checking the dates: May 10 + 7 days = May 17, which matches ep2's broadcast date.\n\nSo, this seems to hold true.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim.\n\nLooking at each row for \"arienai kisu,\" it's only present in ep2. So, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. For ep2: column \"Unnamed: 0\" (which is the episode number) and column \"translation of title.\"\nBut wait, actually, the claim refers to a term which is in both Romanized Title and Translation of Title columns for ep2. So, I think we need to consider both columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only one cell is needed since it's about the same row.\n\nWait, but the instruction says each relevant cell should have \"row_index\" (the index, e.g., 0 for first row) and \"column_name.\" So, for ep2, which is row 1 (since indexing starts at 0), I need to see which columns are involved.\n\nIn the table, the first column is Unnamed: 0, which is the episode number. Then comes \"episode title,\" \"romanized title,\" \"translation of title,\" etc.\n\nThe claim refers to \"arienai kisu\" being in both Romanized and Translation columns for ep2. So, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:1 (since it's the second row), column_name: \"Unnamed: 0\" because that's the episode number which is 'ep 2'.\nWait, but no, the claim refers to a title with that term, so perhaps the Romanized Title and Translation columns in ep2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell for ep2 in \"romanized title\" and \"translation of title.\"\n\nBut actually, each row has one translation. So, ep2's romanized title is \"arienai kisu,\" and its translation is \"the unthinkable kiss.\" Both are part of the same row (row 1).\n\nSo, perhaps the relevant cells are:\n\n- For ep2: columns \"romanized title\" and \"translation of title.\"\nBut wait, each row has a single value for each column. So, in terms of cells, it's two separate cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the row where \"arienai kisu\" is present as either Romanized or Translation.\n\nWait, but perhaps only one cell needs to be relevant because the claim is about that episode being broadcasted 7 days after another date, so we need to look at the date in ep2 and see if it's 7 days after another.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the broadcast dates for all episodes where \"arienai kisu\" is present (which is only ep2) and check against other episodes.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is saying that ep2 is broadcast 7 days after a title with the earliest date. So, the 'title' in question is another episode's title, which has the earliest date.\n\nSo, perhaps the relevant cells are:\n\n1. The \"broadcast date\" of ep2 (May 17) and the \"broadcast date\" of ep1 (May 10), to verify if ep2 is exactly 7 days after ep1.\n\nAlso, the column for the title in ep2 (\"romanized title\") which contains \"arienai kisu.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the relevant cells are:\n\n- For ep2: row index 1, columns \"translation of title\" (since that's where \"arienai kisu\" is) and \"broadcast date.\"\n- For ep1: row index 0, column \"broadcast date\" to check if adding 7 days gets us to ep2's broadcast date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is only concerned with ep2 being 7 days after a title with the earliest broadcast date. So, the 'title' in question here is another episode's title that has the earliest date (ep1). Therefore, we need to refer to ep1's \"episode title\" and its broadcast date.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this; perhaps only ep2's relevant columns are needed because the claim centers on that specific episode being 7 days after another.\n\nI think the most accurate way is:\n\n- The cell in row 1 for \"romanized title\": \"arienai kisu.\"\n- The cells in row 0 and row1 for their respective broadcast dates to confirm ep2 is 7 days after ep1.\n\nSo, I'll list all relevant cells that support the claim.\n\nFirst, ep2's romanized title: because it contains \"arienai kisu,\" which is part of the claim.\n\nSecond, ep1's broadcast date: May 10, and ep2's broadcast date: May17. So, two cells there as well.\n\nBut perhaps the instruction wants each piece of information that supports the claim as a separate cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just ep2's \"romanized title\" and \"translation of title,\" since those are where the term is located, and then the broadcast dates to check the 7-day difference.\n\nWait, but each row has only one value per column. So, for example:\n\n- In row1, the \"romanized title\" cell contains \"arienai kisu.\"\n- In row0, the \"broadcast date\" cell contains May10.\n- In row1, the \"broadcast date\" cell contains May17.\n\nSo, these three cells are relevant: romanized title in ep2, and broadcast dates of ep1 and ep2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows and columns are:\n\nRow 0: \"broadcast date\" (May10)\nRow1: \"romanized title\" (\"arienai kusu\"), \"translation of title\" (\"the unthinkable kiss\"), and \"broadcast date\" (May17)\n\nSo, in total, four cells: row0 broadcast, row1 romanized, row1 translation, row1 broadcast.\n\nBut maybe the instruction counts each column as a separate cell per row. So, for row1, it's three cells, and for row0, one cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the specific columns that are directly relevant to the claim.\n\nI think I need to be precise here. The task is to list all the cells in the table that are relevant for supporting the claim.\n\nThe claim states two things:\n\n1. That \"arienai kusu\" is a title (romanized or translated) of ep2.\n2. That ep2 was broadcast 7 days after another episode, which has the earliest broadcast date (ep1).\n\nSo, for point 1: We need to identify that in ep2's row, the romanized title and translation both contain \"arienai kusu.\" So, those two cells are relevant.\n\nFor point 2: We need to show that ep2 was broadcast on May17, which is 7 days after ep1's May10. Thus, we need to look at the broadcast dates of ep1 and ep2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row1 (ep2), \"romanized title\": contains \"arienai kusu.\"\n- Row1, \"translation of title\": contains \"the unthinkable kiss\" which also refers to the same title as romanized.\n- Row0 (ep1), \"broadcast date\": May10.\n- Row1, \"broadcast date\": May17.\n\nSo, all these four cells are relevant because they directly support the claim in terms of providing the necessary information about the titles and dates involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to include only ep2's romanized and translation columns, as those contain the term in question. The broadcast dates could be inferred from their presence, but without them, you can't confirm the 7-day difference.\n\nTherefore, I think including all four cells is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row 0 (ep1): \"broadcast date\" (May 10)\n2. Row 1: \n   - \"romanized title\": \"arienai kusu\"\n   - \"translation of title\": \"the unthinkable kiss\"\n3. Row 1: \"broadcast date\" (May 17)\n\nThese cells provide the necessary information to confirm that \"arienai kusu\" is the romanized and translated title of ep2, which was broadcasted exactly seven days after ep1's broadcast on May 10.\n\n### Answer:\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, Column: broadcast date\n- Row 1, Columns: romanized title and translation of title\n- Row 1, Column: broadcast date\n\nThese cells support the claim that \"arienai kusu\" is ep2's title and was broadcast seven days after ep1.",

Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 2.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which part of the table corresponds to \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\" Looking at the column 'Unnamed: 0', each row starts with a label like 'ep 1' etc. So, I need to find the row where 'Unnamed: 0' is 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu'. \n\nLooking through the rows:\n- ep 1\n- ep 2\n- ep 3: fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu (Romanized title)\n- ep 4\n- ep 5\n- ep 6\n\nYes, ep 3 has 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' as the Romanized title. So, that's the relevant row, which is index 2 because it's the third row (starting from 0). The relevant column here is 'ratings'.\n\nNext, I need to find the \"title with the most recent broadcast date.\" So, I should look at the 'broadcast date' column and identify which episode was most recently aired.\n\nLooking at the 'broadcast date' column:\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nEp 6 was broadcasted on June 14, 2010, which is the latest date. So, the most recent broadcast date corresponds to ep 6.\n\nNow, I need to check the ratings for both episodes:\n- For 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' (ep 3), the rating is 15.6%.\n- For ep 6, the rating is 13.4%.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 15.6% is actually higher than 13.4%, not lower. The claim says ep 3 has a higher rating by 2.2%. Let me calculate the difference: 15.6 - 13.4 = 2.2%. So yes, it's exactly 2.2% higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because ep 3 (fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu) has a rating that is 2.2% higher than ep 6, which was most recently broadcasted.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe claim is: \"suki to ietara iinoni have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the components of this claim. The key points here are:\n\n1. The title in question is \"suki to ietara iinoni.\"\n2. It's stated that this title has the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\n\nSo my first step is to locate where \"suki to ietara iinoni\" appears in the table and then check its broadcast date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to an episode with columns like 'Unnamed: 0', 'episode title', 'romanized title', etc. Let me scan through the rows:\n\n- ep 1: \u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\n- ep 2: \u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\n- ep 3: \u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\n- ep 4: \u3053\u3093\u306a\u306b\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u2026\n- ep 5: \u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3044\u3044\u306e\u306b\n- ep 6: \u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\u5e8f\u5e55\u30fb\u5225\u308c\n\nWait, \"suki to ietara iinoni\" is the romanized title of ep 5. So that's \"ep 5\".\n\nNow, I need to check the broadcast date for ep 5. From the table:\n\n| ep 5         | \u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3044\u3044\u306e\u306b  | suki to ietara iinoni   | if only i could say , i like you       | june 7 , 2010    | 17.4%     |\n\nSo, the broadcast date is June 7, 2010.\n\nNow, I need to see if this is the 2nd most recent broadcast date among all episodes in the table. Let's list out all the broadcast dates:\n\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nNow, I need to order these dates from most recent to least recent. The most recent would be the latest date, which is June 14, 2010 (ep 6). Next would be June 7, 2010 (ep 5), then May 31, 2010 (ep 4), followed by May 24 (ep3), May17(ep2), and May10(ep1).\n\nSo the order from most to least recent is:\n\n1. ep 6 - June14\n2. ep5 - June7\n3. ep4 - May31\n4. ep3 - May24\n5. ep2 - May17\n6. ep1 - May10\n\nThe claim says that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (ep5) has the 2nd most recent broadcast date. According to this order, yes, it's second, right behind ep6.\n\nSo the claim seems true because ep5 is indeed the second most recent. Therefore, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for each row would be 'episode title' and 'broadcast date'.\n\nFor ep5, the row index is 4 (since we start counting from 0). So the relevant_cells should include both 'episode title' and 'broadcast date' from ep5's row.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are Unnamed:0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, ratings. So for each row, the cells are in order [Unnamed:0, episode title, romanized title, ..., broadcast date].\n\nSo for ep5 (row index 4), the relevant columns are 'episode title' and 'broadcast date'. Thus, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"episode title\"}\n- {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"broadcast date\"}\n\nI need to make sure that I'm correctly mapping these. Also, since the claim refers to the broadcast date, both columns are needed to verify the date and its position.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should be TRUE with these relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 4% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\" So, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Does \"suki to ietara iinoni\" exist in the table? \n2. Is its rating exactly 4% higher than the lowest-rated episode?\n\nStarting with the first part, I'll scan through the 'episode title' column. The titles listed are:\n\n- ep 1: \u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044 (Omae ga hosii)\n- ep 2: \u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9 (Arienai kisu)\n- ep 3: \u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba (Fukusyu no puropousu)\n- ep 4: \u3053\u3093\u306a\u306b\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u2026 (Konna ni suki dattanda\u2026)\n- ep 5: \u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3044\u3044\u306e\u306b (Suki to ietara iinoni)\n- ep 6: \u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\u5e8f\u5e55\u30fb\u5225\u308c (Saishusho jomakuwakare)\n\nYes, \"suki to ietara iinoni\" is ep 5. So that's the relevant row and column: row_index 4 (since it starts from 0) and column_name 'episode title'.\n\nNext, I need to identify the lowest-rated episode. Let's look at the 'ratings' column:\n\n- ep 1: 22.4%\n- ep 2: 19.2%\n- ep 3: 15.6%\n- ep 4: 15.5%\n- ep 5: 17.4%\n- ep 6: 13.4%\n\nThe lowest rating is 13.4% for ep 6. Now, I need to see if ep 5's rating (17.4%) is 4% higher than 13.4%. \n\nCalculating the difference: 17.4 - 13.4 = 4%. So yes, it is exactly a 4% higher rating.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true, so the overall answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a rating that's exactly 4% higher than the lowest-rated episode.

From the table headers, it looks like the \"broadcast date\" column has the dates.\n- Next, I need to list out all the broadcast dates for each episode:\n  - ep 1: May 10, 2010\n  - ep 2: May 17, 2010\n  - ep 3: May 24, 2010\n  - ep 4: May 31, 2010\n  - ep 5: June 7, 2010\n  - ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nNow, I need to order these dates from most recent to least recent. The most recent is the one closest to the present, which would be June 14, 2010 (ep 6). Then, the next most recent would be June 7, 2010 (ep 5), followed by May 31, 2010 (ep 4), and so on.\n\nSo the order from most to least recent:\n1. ep 6: June 14, 2010\n2. ep 5: June 7, 2010\n3. ep 4: May 31, 2010\n4. ep 3: May 24, 2010\n5. ep 2: May 17, 2010\n6. ep 1: May 10, 2010\n\nThe claim is that \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (which is ep 3) has the 2nd most recent broadcast date. But looking at the order I just made, ep 5 is June 7, which is more recent than ep 4 (May 31). So ep 5 is actually the 2nd most recent.\n\nTherefore, the claim that ep 3 has the 2nd most recent date is incorrect because ep 5 is more recent. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (ep 3) has the 2nd most recent broadcast date, but it's actually ep 5 with June 7, 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"arienai kisu have 5.8% more rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: It's comparing two things:\n   - The TV show episode titled \"arienai kisu\" (ep 2).\n   - The title with the earliest broadcast date.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data Points**:\n   - I need to find the ratings for \"arienai kisu.\"\n   - Determine which title was first in terms of broadcast date.\n   - Find the rating of that earliest title.\n3. **Analyzing the Table**: The table has columns: Unnamed: 0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, ratings.\n\n4. **Locating \"arienai kisu\"**:\n   - Looking through the 'episode title' column, ep 2 is titled \"\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\" which translates to \"the unthinkable kiss.\" The romanized title matches the claim (\"arisenai kisu\"), so this is correct.\n   - From the table, ep 2's ratings are 19.2%.\n\n5. **Finding the Earliest Broadcast Date**:\n   - Checking each episode's broadcast date:\n     - ep 1: May 10, 2010\n     - ep 2: May 17, 2010\n     - ep 3: May 24, 2010\n     - ep 4: May 31, 2010\n     - ep 5: June 7, 2010\n     - ep 6: June 14, 2010\n   - The earliest broadcast date is ep 1 on May 10, 2010.\n\n6. **Rating of the Earliest Title**:\n   - For ep 1, the episode title is \"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\" which translates to \"I want you.\" Romanized as \"omaega hosii.\"\n   - The ratings for ep 1 are 22.4%.\n\n7. **Comparing Ratings**:\n   - The claim says that \"arienai kisu\" has 5.8% more rating than the earliest title.\n   - Calculate 19.2% (rating of arienai kisu) minus 22.4% (earliest title's rating).\n   - 19.2 - 22.4 = -3.2%, which is a decrease, not an increase.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Since the ratings don't support the claim that \"arienai kisu\" has higher ratings by 5.8%, the claim is FALSE.\n\n9. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are where we found the data: ep 2's rating and ep 1's details.\n   - So, row indices 1 (ep 2) and 0 (ep 1), with their respective columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 14 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Title**: \"arienai kisu\"\n2. **Broadcast Date**: 14 days after the earliest broadcast date of a title.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, title (romanized and translated), broadcast date, and ratings. The claim is specifically about \"arienai kisu,\" so I need to find that in the table.\n\nI'll scan through the \"episode title\" column:\n\n- ep 1: \u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\n- ep 2: \u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\n- ep 3: \u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\n- ep 4: \u6700\u671f\u306b\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u2026\n- ep 5: \u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3044\u3044\u306e\u306b\n- ep 6: \u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\u5e8f\u5e55\u30fb\u5225\u308c\n\nAh, there it is. \"arienai kisu\" is the title of episode 2 (ep 2). Now, I need to check its broadcast date and see if another title was broadcasted earlier.\n\nLooking at the broadcast dates for each episode:\n\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest broadcast date among these is May 10, 2010 (ep 1). The claim says that \"arienai kisu\" (ep 2) should be broadcasted 14 days after this earliest date.\n\nCalculating 14 days from May 10: \n\nMay has 31 days. So adding 14 days to May 10 would take us into June:\n\n- May 10 + 14 = May 24. Wait, that's incorrect because May only has 31 days, so let me count correctly:\n\nWait, no. Let me add day by day:\n\nMay 10 + 1 = May 11\n\n+2=12\n\n... up to May 24 would be 15 days later? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me use a different approach.\n\nIf we consider May 10 as the starting point and add 14 days, that's from May 10 to May 31 (which is 21 days) plus 2 more days into June: May 31 + 2 = June 2. So 14 days later would be June 2. But let me check with a calendar:\n\n- From May 10 to May 24 is 15 days (including the start and end days), but if we're adding 14 days strictly, then it's May 24 minus May 10 equals 14 days? Wait, no.\n\nWait, May 10 plus 14 days: May has 31 days, so May 10 + 14 is May 24. Because from the 10th to the 24th is 15 days including both, but if we're adding 14 days strictly after May 10, it would be May 24.\n\nBut let's check each episode's date:\n\nEp 2 was broadcast on May 17, 2010. If the claim is that \"arienai kisu\" should be 14 days after ep 1, which was May 10, then May 24 would be the expected date. However, ep 2 was actually aired on May 17, which is only 7 days after May 10 (since May 10 +7=May 17).\n\nSince 7 days is less than 14, this doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false because \"arienai kisu\" wasn't broadcasted 14 days after the earliest date.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant:\n\nThe relevant columns for checking this would be \"episode title\" and \"broadcast date\".\n\nFor ep 2 (row index 1), we need both its episode title and broadcast date. Also, we need to check the broadcast date of ep 1 (row index 0) as it's the earliest.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1 (ep 2): \"episode title\" and \"broadcast date\"\n- Row 0 (ep 1): \"broadcast date\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\", and the relevant_cells include these three columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 3.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key parts of the claim are:\n1. The specific episode title: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\".\n2. A rating of 3.2% higher.\n3. Comparison with the title that has the most recent broadcast date.\n\nSo, I should find the row where the title is \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\". From the table:\n- It's ep 3 (row index 2).\n- The ratings column for this episode is 15.6%.\n\nNext, I need to identify the title with the most recent broadcast date.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let's break it down. \n\nThe key elements here are:\n1. \"suki to ietara iinoni\" - This looks like one of the episode titles in the table.\n2. 5.8% higher rating than\n3. The title with the lowest rating.\n\nSo, I need to check if the episode titled \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a rating that is exactly 5.8% higher than the lowest-rated episode in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, let's list out all the episodes and their ratings:\n- ep 1: 22.4%\n- ep 2: 19.2%\n- ep 3: 15.6%\n- ep 4: 15.5%\n- ep 5: 17.4%\n- ep 6: 13.4%\n\nWait, that's the ratings in percentage. So, the lowest rating would be the smallest number here. Let me sort them to find the minimum:\n\nEp 3: 15.6%,\nEp 4: 15.5%,\nEp 5: 17.4%,\nEp 6:13.4%.\n\nSo actually, the lowest is ep 6 with 13.4%. Wait, no, that's even lower than 15.5%, so yes, ep 6 has the lowest rating.\n\nNow, what about \"suki to ietara iinoni\"? Let me look at the table again. The column for episode titles is \"episode title\". Scanning through:\n\nep 1: \u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044 (omae ga hosii),\nep 2: \u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9 (arienai kisu),\nep 3: \u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba (fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu),\nep 4: \u3053\u3093\u306a\u306b\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u2026 (konna ni suki dattanda\u2026),\nep 5: \u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3044\u3044\u306e\u306b (suki to ietara iinoni),\nep 6: \u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\u5e8f\u5e55\u30fb\u5225\u308c (saish\u016bsh\u014djomakuwakare).\n\nAh, there it is. ep 5 has the title \"\u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3044\u3044\u306e\u306b\", which translates to \"if only I could say 'I like you'\". So in the claim, they're referring to this episode as having a higher rating than the lowest.\n\nSo now, I need to calculate the percentage difference between ep 5 and the lowest-rated ep (ep6).\n\nEp5: 17.4%\nEp6:13.4%\n\nThe difference is 17.4 - 13.4 = 4%. \n\nWait, the claim says it's a 5.8% higher rating. But according to my calculation, it's only a 4% increase.\n\nThat's a discrepancy. So, the claim might be incorrect because the actual increase is less than what's stated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the claim is saying that ep5's rating is 5.8% higher than the lowest. Let me calculate it properly.\n\nPercentage increase from ep6 to ep5:\n\n((17.4 -13.4)/13.4)*100 = (4/13.4)*100 \u2248 29.85%.\n\nSo, ep5's rating is approximately 29.85% higher than ep6's. But the claim says 5.8%, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the ratings. Let me double-check the table:\n\nYes, the ratings are as listed: ep1-22.4, ep2-19.2, ep3-15.6, ep4-15.5, ep5-17.4, ep6-13.4.\n\nSo, lowest is ep6 at 13.4%, and ep5 is 17.4%. So the increase from ep6 to ep5 is about 29.85%, not 5.8%.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating\" is false because the actual increase is over 29%, which is significantly higher than 5.8%. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the table was misrepresented? Let me check again. The user provided a markdown table that seems correctly transcribed. So yes, ep6 has 13.4%.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion of a 5.8% increase is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (ep5) has a rating 5.8% higher than the lowest-rated episode. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- The lowest rating is 13.4% for ep6.\n- Ep5's rating is 17.4%, resulting in an increase of approximately 29.85%.\n\nSince this increase doesn't match the claim's 5.8%, the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
