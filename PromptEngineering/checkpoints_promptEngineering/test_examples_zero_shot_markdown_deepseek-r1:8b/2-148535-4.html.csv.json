    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part means. The term \"four ace\" refers to having four aces in a poker hand. In the table, there are different categories for four aces:\n\n1. Four aces with 2,3,4 (I think this is four of a kind, specifically Ace with two, three, or four).\n2. Four 2,3,4 with an Ace-4 (so like four twos, threes, fours and one Ace-four? Or maybe it's four of a number with an ace as the fourth card. Not entirely sure.)\n3. Straight flush might also be involved here, but I think the main categories are the specific ones listed.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\", which is row index 2, the credits are:\n1 credit: 400\n2:800\n3:1200\n4:1600\n5:2000\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's said that at 5 credits, four aces win 800. That doesn't match because at 5, it's 2000. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, the claim could be referring to \"four of a kind\" with Aces, which is another row. Looking for four aces:\n\nRow index 4: four aces (so without the 2,3,4) and the payoffs are:\n1 credit:160\n2:320\n3:480\n4:640\n5:800\n\nSo at 1 credit, it's 160, which matches the claim. At 5 credits, it's 800, which also matches.\n\nWait, but in the table, under four aces w / 2,3,4 (row 2), for 1 credit, it's 400, and for five, 2000. So that row is different from four aces without the other cards.\n\nSo the claim mentions \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit.\" That seems to align with the four aces (row index 4) because at 1 and 5, those are the numbers: 160 and 800. So that's correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there isn't another category that also has these values, which might complicate things. For example, maybe \"four 2,3,4 w / a -4\" (row index 3) at 1 credit is 160 as well, but I think those are separate from four aces.\n\nSo the claim is specifically talking about four aces, so row index 4. Therefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\nAt 1 credit:160\nAt 5 credits:800\n\nTherefore, in the table, these correspond to row 4 for four aces at columns \"1 credit\" and \"5 credits\".\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because both parts of the claim match the table.\n\nI don't think there are any other rows that would affect this. The other four aces with 2,3,4 has higher payouts but different from what's claimed. So yeah, it seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data for four aces at both 1 and 5 credits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit , the result for 1 credit would be 160.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the part about four aces yielding 900 when there are 5 credits. Looking at the table, under \"four aces,\" the entry for 5 credits is 800, not 900. So that part seems incorrect.\n\nNext, checking the result for 1 credit. The claim says it would be 160. In the table, looking at the row for four aces again, under 1 credit, it shows 160. That part matches.\n\nSo even though one part is correct, the first part about 5 credits being 900 isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two things: that four aces yield 900 for five credits and 160 for one credit. Checking the table:\n\n- For five credits under \"four aces,\" it's 800, not 900.\n- For one credit under \"four aces,\" it's indeed 160.\n\nOnly the second part is correct, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
