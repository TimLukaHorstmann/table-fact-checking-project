    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false by checking against the table provided. The claim says: \"in 2003, the player was the winner at the championship in rome and also the championship in toronto.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table for the year 2003. From the table, I see that there are two entries for 2003. The first is for Rome, where Martina Navratilova is the winner against Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova with a score of 6-4,5-7,6-2. The second entry is for Toronto, also in 2003, where Navratilova is again the winner against Mar\u00eda Vento-Kabchi and Angelique Widjaja with a score of 3-6,6-1,6-1.\n\nSo both the Rome and Toronto championships in 2003 have Martina Navratilova as the winner. The claim states that the player was the winner at both these events. Since both entries are for 2003 and list her as the winner, this seems to be correct.\n\nNow, I should also check if there are any runner-ups or other outcomes in 2003 that might affect this. Looking through the table again, all 2003 entries show Navratilova as either winner or not listed as a runner-up. The runner-ups are for 2004 and 2005. So, no conflicting information from other years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by the table entries for 2003 in both Rome and Toronto where Martina Navratilova is listed as the winner.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the partner for both the championship in rome in 2003 and the championship in toronto in 2003 be martina navratilova.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with several columns: outcome (which can be 'winner' or 'runner-up'), year, championship location, surface, partner, opponents, and score.\n\nThe claim is specifically about two tournaments: Rome in 2003 and Toronto in 2003. The partner for both of these should be Martina Navratilova.\n\nSo, I'll need to find the relevant rows for these two championships.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Rome in 2003, the row index is 0 (since it's the first data row after the headers). The outcome is 'winner', and the partner is listed as Martina Navratilova. So that checks out.\n\n- Next, for Toronto in 2003. Looking through the rows, I see that there are multiple entries for different years and locations. Wait, let me check each row's year:\n\nRow 0: 2003 Rome\nRow 1: 2003 Toronto\nRow 2: 2004 Indian Wells\nRow 3: 2004 Miami\nRow 4: 2005 Miami\n\nSo, the second entry (row index 1) is indeed for Toronto in 2003. The partner here is also Martina Navratilova.\n\nTherefore, both the Rome and Toronto championships in 2003 had Martina Navratilova as their partners. That means the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant. For each of these two rows (0 and 1), the 'partner' column is relevant. So, row_index 0 for partner and row_index 1 for partner.\n\nSo the JSON should include both of those cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because both specified tournaments had Martina Navratilova as the partner. The relevant cells are both in the 'partner' column for the respective rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the player be the runner - up at the 2004 indian well championship , and be also the runner - up at the 2004 miami championship.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any rows that match both conditions. Let's go row by row.\n\nStarting with row index 0: it's a winner in 2003, so not relevant.\n\nRow index 1: also a winner in 2003, not relevant.\n\nRow index 2: runner-up in 2004 at Indian Wells. That matches the first part of the claim regarding the Indian Wells championship. But I need to check if this player is also the runner-up at Miami in 2004.\n\nLooking further down, row index 3: also a runner-up in 2004, but it's at Miami. The partner here is elena likhovtseva, which might be the same as the previous runner-up in Indian Wells? Wait, let me check if the player is consistent.\n\nIn row 2 (Indian Wells), the runner-up has a partner named elena likhovtseva. In row 3 (Miami), the runner-up also has the same partner name. That suggests it's the same person. So this player was indeed the runner-up in both Indian Wells and Miami in 2004.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there exists a player who met both conditions.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}]}",

The claim says: \"the opponent in 2005 be lisa raymond rennae stubbs and in rome in 2003 , the opponent be jelena doki\u0107 and nadia petrova\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. Let me see what information is there. The table has several columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, partner, opponents, and score. Each row represents a different event, with details about who won or was the runner-up.\n\nLet's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. In 2005, the opponent was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\n2. In Rome in 2003, the opponent was Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n\nI'll check each part against the table to see if they match.\n\nStarting with the first part: In 2005, the opponent was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs. Looking at the table, I need to find the row for 2005. Scanning through the rows, I see that in 2005, it's a \"winner\" in miami, hard surface, partner is Alicia Molik, and opponents are Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs. That matches exactly with the first part of the claim.\n\nNow the second part: In Rome in 2003, the opponent was Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. Checking the table for Rome in 2003, it's a \"winner\" row. The opponents listed are Jelena Doki\u0107 Nadia Petrova. Wait, the claim says \"opponent be jelena doki\u0107 and nadia petrova\". The table has them as one entry: \"jelena doki\u0107 nadia petrova\". So it's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there aren't any other entries for 2003 in Rome. Looking at the table again, I see that there are two rows for 2003: one for Rome and one for Toronto. The Rome row is indeed the winner with those opponents.\n\nSo both parts of the claim check out correctly against the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

In 2004, at the Indian Wells championship, the partner was Elena Likhovtseva.\n2. In 2003, at the Toronto championship, the partner was Martina Navratilova.\n\nI need to check each of these against the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's in markdown format with columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, partner, opponents, and score.\n\nLet me locate the relevant rows based on the claim.\n\nFor the first part (2004 Indian Wells):\n- The row should have year 2004, championship \"Indian Wells\", and partner Elena Likhovtseva.\nLooking at the table:\n- Row index 2: runner-up in 2004, Indian Wells, hard, partner is Elena Likhovtseva. Opponents are Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Su\u00e1rez, with scores 6-1, 6-2.\n\nSo this matches the first part of the claim: yes, Elena was her partner there.\n\nFor the second part (2003 Toronto):\n- The row should have year 2003, championship \"Toronto\", partner Martina Navratilova.\nLooking at the table:\n- Row index 1: winner in 2003, Toronto, hard, partner is Martina Navratilova. Opponents are Mar\u00eda Vento-Kabchi and Angelique Widjaja, with scores 3-6, 6-1, 6-1.\n\nYes, this matches as well: Martina was her partner at the 2003 Toronto championship.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 2003 , the player be the winner at the 2004 championship in miami and also the championship in indian well\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim. It mentions two championships: one in Miami in 2004 and another in Indian Wells in 2004. The player is supposed to have won both these championships in 2003? Wait, that doesn't make sense because if they won it in 2003, how could they also win it again in 2004? Unless the claim has a typo, but I'll go with what's given.\n\nLooking at the table, let's check each row to see if any match these conditions.\n\nStarting with the first row (row_index 0):\n- It's about the winner of the 2003 Rome championship on clay. Partners are Martina Navratilova, opponents include Jelena Dokic and Nadia Petrova. The score is 6-4,5-7,6-2. This doesn't relate to Miami or Indian Wells in 2004.\n\nSecond row (row_index 1):\n- Winner of the 2003 Toronto championship on hard surface. Partner is Martina Navratilova, opponents include Mar\u00eda Vento and Kabchi Angelique Widjaja. The score is 3-6,6-1,6-1. Again, this is in 2003 but in Toronto, so not directly related.\n\nThird row (row_index 2):\n- Runner-up at the 2004 Indian Wells on hard surface. Partner is Elena Likhovtseva, opponents include Virginia Ruano and Paola Su\u00e1rez. The score is 6-1,6-2. This is in 2004 for Indian Wells, but it's a runner-up, not a winner.\n\nFourth row (row_index 3):\n- Runner-up at the 2004 Miami on hard surface. Partner is Elena Likhovtseva, opponents include Nadia Petrova and Meghann Shaughnessy. The score is 6-2,6-3. This is for Miami in 2004 as a runner-up.\n\nFifth row (row_index 4):\n- Winner of the 2005 Miami championship on hard surface. Partner is Alicia Molik, opponents include Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Score is 7-5,6-7(5-7),6-2. This is in 2005, so not relevant to 2003 or 2004.\n\nNow, looking back at the claim: It mentions the player being the winner of both the 2004 Miami and Indian Wells championships in 2003. From the table, there are no winners for Indian Wells in 2004. Instead, only a runner-up is listed for 2004 Indian Wells (row_index 2). There's also a runner-up for 2004 Miami (row_index 3), but not a winner.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the player be the winner at the 2004 championship in miami and also the championship in indian well.\" So it's saying the same player won both tournaments in 2004. But in the table, for 2004 Indian Wells, there's only a runner-up, not a winner. For Miami in 2004, there is no row that shows a winner\u2014only a runner-up (row_index 3). Therefore, there's no row where someone won both Miami and Indian Wells in 2004.\n\nMoreover, the claim refers to \"the player\" being the winner in 2003 at both tournaments, which seems impossible because they can't win two separate events in the same year, especially different surfaces. Unless it's referring to consecutive years, but the phrasing is unclear. However, based on the table, there's no evidence that a single player won both Indian Wells and Miami in 2004.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true because there are no entries in the table for a winner of both those tournaments in 2004.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2003, the player was the winner at both the 2004 Miami and Indian Wells championships. However, examining the table:\n\n- There is no row where a single player won both Miami and Indian Wells in 2004. \n- The only entries for 2004 are runner-ups, not winners.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE as there's no supporting data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"championship\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has columns like outcome, year, championship, surface, partner, opponents, and score. \n\nThe claim is about two specific championships: Rome in 2003 and Toronto in 2003.

Not Rome or Toronto, so not relevant for the claim about Rome and Toronto.\n\n4. Fourth row (row_index 3): runner - up in 2004 at Miami on hard. Again, not Rome or Toronto, so doesn't apply here.\n\n5. Fifth row (row_index 4): winner in 2005 at Miami on hard.

But row 3 is Indian Wells, not Rome or Toronto, so it's irrelevant for the claim about Rome.\n\nRow 4 is Miami again, not the tournaments mentioned in the claim.

So, I need to find the relevant rows that match the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"opponent in 2005 be jelena doki\u0107 and nadia petrova.\" \n\nI'll scan through each row for the year 2005. The table has a row where the outcome is 'winner' for 2005, held in Miami, on hard surface, with Alicia Molik as the partner. The opponents listed here are Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs. So, that doesn't match the claim which mentions Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another row for 2005 that I might have missed. Looking again, the table only has one row for 2005, so it seems like the opponent in 2005 isn't Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. Therefore, this part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \"in rome in 2003 , the opponent be lisa raymond rennae stubbs.\" \n\nLooking for the year 2003, there are two rows. The first is 'winner' in Rome with Martina Navratilova as the partner and opponents Jelena Doki\u0107 Nadia Petrova. The second row is also 'winner' but in Toronto, partners again with Martina Navratilova, and opponents are Mar\u00eda Vento-Kabchi and Angelique Widjaja.\n\nSo, in 2003 in Rome, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova, not Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs. Wait, but that doesn't match the claim either. The claim says the opponent was Lisa Raymond... So this part is also incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again: \"the opponent in 2005 be jelena doki\u0107 and nadia petrova and in rome in 2003 , the opponent be lisa raymond rennae stubbs.\" \n\nSo, for 2005, opponents are Jelena and Nadia, but according to the table, that's not the case. The opponent in 2005 was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\n\nFor 2003 Rome, the claim says the opponent was Lisa Raymon... But according to the table, in Rome 2003, the opponents were Jelena and Nadia. So both parts of the claim seem incorrect.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to check each condition. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at 2005: The only row is for Miami, where the opponents are Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs. So the claim says the opponent was Jelena and Nadia, which isn't correct.\n\nIn 2003 Rome: The winner's opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. The claim says the opponent was Lisa Raymon... so that's also incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the columns. Let me check the table again. The 'opponents' column lists who they played against. So for 2003 Rome, it's Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. For 2005 Miami, it's Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are wrong. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because in 2005, the opponent was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs, not Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. Also, in 2003 Rome, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova, not Lisa Raymond.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
