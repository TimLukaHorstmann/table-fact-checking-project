    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Prince Park venue having the largest crowd in the 1965 VFL season is true or false by checking the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"prince park venue have the largest crowd in the 1965 vfl season.\" So, I'm looking for the crowd number associated with Prince Park and see if it's the highest among all venues listed in that season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match between home and away teams. The columns include home team, home score, away team, away score, venue name, crowd size, and date. Since the claim is about the 1965 VFL season, I should focus on matches from that year. However, all the dates in the table are \"24 april 1965,\" so they're all within the same season.\n\nNow, I need to find out which venues have the largest crowd numbers. The relevant column for this claim is the \"crowd\" column.\n\nI'll extract the crowd numbers from each row:\n\n- Melbourne: 21744\n- Essendon: 20500\n- Collingwood: 31370\n- Carlton: 34945\n- South Melbourne: 23979\n- Footscray: 16998\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest is 34945, which is for Prince Park. So that's the crowd size at Prince Park.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the largest among all the venues listed in the table. Since the other venues have lower crowd numbers, 34945 is indeed the largest.\n\nSo, the claim is true because Prince Park had the highest crowd number on April 24, 1965.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Prince Park having the largest crowd in the 1965 VFL season:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Check the \"crowd\" column for all entries from April 24, 1965.\n2. **Extract Crowd Numbers**:\n   - Melbourne: 21,744\n   - Essendon: 20,500\n   - Collingwood: 31,370\n   - Carlton: 34,945\n   - South Melbourne: 23,979\n   - Footscray: 16,998\n\n3. **Determine the Largest Crowd**: The highest number is 34,945 at Prince Park.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Prince Park has the largest crowd in the given season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"essendon have the highest score as a home team in the season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"essendon,\" which is one of the home teams listed in the table. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Since we're looking at their performance as a home team, I should focus on the \"home team\" row for Essendon.\n\nLooking at the table, Essendon is listed in the second row. Their home team score is 20.18 (138). Now, to check if this is the highest among all home teams in that season, I need to compare Essendon's score with other home teams.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Melbourne: 11.14 (80)\n2. Essendon: 20.18 (138)\n3. Collingwood: 11.13 (79)\n4. Carlton: 8.11 (59)\n5. South Melbourne: 7.9 (51)\n6. Footscray: 8.6 (54)\n\nComparing all these, the highest score among home teams is Essendon with 20.18 (138). So their claim seems correct.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the venue and date are consistent. The date for all these games is April 24, 1965, which means they were played on the same day, likely in the same season. That's good because we don't have to worry about different years or seasons affecting their performance.\n\nSo, each home team's score as per the table is from the same match date, so it's a single season. Therefore, Essendon indeed has the highest score among all home teams listed here.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"mcg venue have a smaller crowd than victoria park\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing two venues: McG and Victoria Park. Specifically, it's saying that the crowd at McG is smaller than that at Victoria Park.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. Each row has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. So, I need to focus on the \"crowd\" column for both McG and Victoria Park.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row of the table to find the entries where the venue is either McG or Victoria Park. \n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Venue is McG, crowd is 21744.\n2. Row 3: Venue is Princes Park, which isn't relevant here.\n3. Row 4: Venue is Lake Oval, not needed.\n4. Row 5: Venue is Western Oval, nope.\n5. Row 6: Venue is Victoria Park, crowd is 31370.\n\nSo, the two relevant rows are Row 0 (McG with 21744) and Row 2 (Victoria Park with 31370).\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 21744 vs. 31370. Clearly, 21744 is less than 31370, which means McG has a smaller crowd.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because McG's crowd is indeed smaller than Victoria Park's.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are for McG and Victoria Park, with their respective crowd numbers showing McG having a smaller attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"hawthorn be the away team with the lowest score in the 1965 VFL season\" is true based on the given table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Hawthorn was an away team and had the lowest score among all away teams in the 1965 season. So, I need to find out if there's any information about Hawthorn as an away team with the lowest score on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team, along with their scores, venue, crowd size, and date. The date is 24 April 1965, which matches the season in question.\n\nNow, I'll scan through each row to see where Hawthorn is listed as the away team. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team - Melbourne, Away team - North Melbourne. So Hawthorn isn't here.\n2. Second row: Home team - Essendon, Away team - Hawthorn. This seems relevant because it's Hawthorn as an away team. Their score is 6.8 (44).\n3. Third row: Home team - Collingwood, Away team - Richmond. Not Hawthorn.\n4. Fourth row: Home team - Carlton, Away team - Geelong. No.\n5. Fifth row: Home team - South Melbourne, Away team - St Kilda. No.\n6. Sixth row: Home team - Footscray, Away team - Fitzroy. No.\n\nSo, the only match where Hawthorn is the away team is the second row. Their score there is 6.8 (44). I need to check if this is indeed the lowest among all away teams in that season based on their scores.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the lowest score.\" So, we're looking for the minimal value in the 'away team score' column across all rows where the away team is Hawthorn. But in this table, it's only one occurrence of Hawthorn as an away team with a score of 44 (6.8). \n\nBut to confirm whether this is the lowest overall, I need to check other away teams' scores too. Let me list out all the away team scores from each row:\n\n- North Melbourne: 10.12 (72)\n- Hawthorn: 6.8 (44) [away]\n- Richmond: 9.10 (64)\n- Geelong: 9.11 (65)\n- St Kilda: 12.12 (84)\n- Fitzroy: 9.4 (58)\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Each row lists two teams: the home team and the away team. So I should collect all the away team scores from each row.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. North Melbourne - 10.12 (72)\n2. Hawthorn - 6.8 (44)\n3. Richmond - 9.10 (64)\n4. Geelong - 9.11 (65)\n5. St Kilda - 12.12 (84)\n6. Fitzroy - 9.4 (58)\n\nSo, the away team scores are: 72, 44, 64, 65, 84, and 58.\n\nThe lowest score among these is 44 by Hawthorn. So yes, Hawthorn has the lowest away team score in that season based on this table.\n\nWait, but I should make sure if the table includes all teams or only specific ones. Since the table shows six matches, perhaps it's a subset of the entire season. If the claim is about the 1965 VFL season, we need to ensure that Hawthorn's score was indeed the lowest among all away teams in that season.\n\nBut based on this table, which seems to list several matches from April 24, 1965, and given that it's a specific date, perhaps the claim is referring to these matches. So within these games, Hawthorn has the lowest away team score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"hawthorn be the away team with the lowest score in the 1965 vfl season,\" we check each match where Hawthorn was an away team and compare their scores to other away teams on that date. \n\n- **Relevant Rows**: Only one row where Hawthorn is the away team (Essendon vs. Hawthorn) with a score of 6.8 (44).\n- **Away Team Scores**: \n  - North Melbourne: 10.12 (72)\n  - Hawthorn: 6.8 (44)\n  - Richmond: 9.10 (64)\n  - Geelong: 9.11 (65)\n  - St Kilda: 12.12 (84)\n  - Fitzroy: 9.4 (58)\n\nHawthorn's score of 44 is the lowest among these away teams on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false by looking at the table provided. The claim says, \"Geelong get a lower score than North Melbourne as an away team.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows and columns in the table are relevant. The claim mentions both Geelong and North Melbourne as away teams. So, I should look for these two away teams in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a home team and their corresponding away team. For example, the first row has Melbourne as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team. Similarly, looking through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Home Team - Melbourne, Away Team - North Melbourne\n- Row 1: Home Team - Essendon, Away Team - Hawthorn\n- Row 2: Home Team - Collingwood, Away Team - Richmond\n- Row 3: Home Team - Carlton, Away Team - Geelong\n- Row 4: Home Team - South Melbourne, Away Team - St Kilda\n- Row 5: Home Team - Footscray, Away Team - Fitzroy\n\nSo, the away teams are North Melbourne, Hawthorn, Richmond, Geelong, St Kilda, and Fitzroy. The claim is specifically about Geelong as an away team, comparing their score to North Melbourne's.\n\nNow, let's find where Geelong is an away team. Looking at row 3: Home Team - Carlton, Away Team - Geelong. So the relevant row index is 3, and the column for the away team's score would be \"away team score\".\n\nSimilarly, North Melbourne is the away team in row 0, so their score is in the same column.\n\nSo, I need to compare the scores of Geelong (away) against North Melbourne (away). From the table:\n\n- Geelong's away score: 9.11 (65)\n- North Melbourne's away score: 10.12 (72)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, row 0 is Melbourne (home) vs North Melbourne (away), and their scores are Melbourne 11.14 (80), North Melbourne 10.12 (72). So North Melbourne's away score is 10.12 (72).\n\nRow 3: Carlton (home) vs Geelong (away). Geelong's score is 9.11 (65). So Geelong as an away team scored 65, and North Melbourne as an away team scored 72.\n\nThe claim says that Geelong got a lower score than North Melbourne when they were away teams. Since 65 is less than 72, the statement would be true.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim is about Geelong getting a lower score than North Melbourne as away teams. So yes, 65 (Geelong) < 72 (North Melbourne). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For North Melbourne: row index 0, column \"away team score\"\n- For Geelong: row index 3, column \"away team score\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE with these cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by comparing the away scores of Geelong and North Melbourne from their respective matches. Geelong scored lower than North Melbourne.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Prince Park venue have the least crowd to show up in the 1965 VFL season.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The main point here is that Prince Park had the smallest number of people attending any game during that season. So, I need to check how many people attended games at Prince Park and compare it with the attendances at other venues.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Since the claim is about the 1965 VFL season, I can filter the data to only include games from that year. All the rows have a date of April 24, 1965, so they all fall within the 1965 season.\n\nNext, I need to identify which row corresponds to Prince Park. Scanning through the venues: mcg, windy hill, victoria park, princes park, lake oval, and western oval. Princes Park is one of them, so that's the relevant row for Prince Park.\n\nNow, looking at the crowd column for that particular game. The crowd number listed under \"princes park\" is 34,945. I should compare this with the attendances at other venues to see if it's truly the least.\n\nLet me list out all the attendances:\n\n- mcg: 21,744\n- windy hill: 20,500\n- victoria park: 31,370\n- princes park: 34,945\n- lake oval: 23,979\n- western oval: 16,998\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Lake Oval has 23,979 and mcg is at 21,744, which are both lower than Prince Park's 34,945. So actually, Prince Park isn't the least. The lowest attendance seems to be Western Oval with 16,998.\n\nBut let me double-check the numbers because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. I'll list them in order from smallest to largest:\n\n1. Western Oval: 16,998\n2. Melbourne (mcg): 21,744\n3. South Melbourne (lake oval): 23,979\n4. Essendon (windy hill): 20,500 \u2013 Wait, no, 20,500 is less than 21,744 but more than 16,998.\nWait, actually, Windy Hill has 20,500 which is between Western Oval and mcg.\n\nSo the order should be:\n\n1. Western Oval: 16,998\n2. Windy Hill: 20,500\n3. Melbourne (mcg): 21,744\n4. South Melbourne (lake oval): 23,979\n5. Essendon (windy hill): Wait, no, Windy Hill is already listed as 20,500.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing rows. Let me list all the crowd numbers:\n\n- mcg: 21,744\n- windy hill: 20,500\n- victoria park: 31,370\n- princes park: 34,945\n- lake oval: 23,979\n- western oval: 16,998\n\nSo from smallest to largest:\n\n1. Western Oval: 16,998\n2. Windy Hill: 20,500\n3. Melbourne (mcg): 21,744\n4. Lake Oval: 23,979\n5. Victoria Park: 31,370\n6. Princes Park: 34,945\n\nSo the smallest attendance is at Western Oval, not Prince Park. Therefore, the claim that Prince Park has the least crowd is false because Western Oval had fewer attendees.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other venues with lower attendances than Prince Park. Since Western Oval is indeed lower, it's clear that Prince Park isn't the least.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify this would be the row for Western Oval and perhaps others to confirm their attendance numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Prince Park had the least crowd in the 1965 VFL season. However, upon reviewing the table, it's evident that Western Oval had a smaller attendance of 16,998. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions that Hawthorn is an away team with the highest points recorded. So, I should look for rows where the home team is Hawthorn and then check their away performance. Wait, no, actually, the claim says Hawthorn is the away team, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again: the claim states that Hawthorn is an away team with the highest points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. So, for each match where Hawthorn is the away team, I need to check their scores against other away teams on the same day or across all matches. But wait, in the table, it's unclear if it's just one date, April 24, 1965. All the matches in the table are from that date.\n\nSo, first, identify which rows have Hawthorn as the away team. Let me scan each row:\n\n1. Melbourne vs North Melbourne \u2013 away team is North Melbourne.\n2. Essendon vs Hawthorn \u2013 away team is Hawthorn. So this row has Hawthorn as away with a score of 6.8 (44).\n3. Collingwood vs Richmond \u2013 away team is Richmond.\n4. Carlton vs Geelong \u2013 away team is Geelong.\n5. South Melbourne vs St Kilda \u2013 away team is St Kilda.\n6. Footscray vs Fitzroy \u2013 away team is Fitzroy.\n\nWait, so in the table provided, Hawthorn is only an away team once, against Essendon. Their score is 6.8 (44). Now, I need to check if this is the highest point among all away teams on that date. Let's look at other away teams:\n\n- North Melbourne scored 10.12 (72)\n- Richmond scored 9.10 (64)\n- Geelong scored 9.11 (65)\n- St Kilda scored 12.12 (84)\n- Fitzroy scored 9.4 (58)\n\nComparing these, the highest score among away teams is St Kilda with 12.12 (84). Hawthorn's score of 6.8 (44) is much lower than that. Therefore, Hawthorn isn't the away team with the highest points on that day.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"the highest point ever record.\" If it refers to all time, then we need more data beyond this single date. But from the table provided, only one match for Hawthorn as an away team is present, which isn't the highest on that day, so perhaps in the entire dataset (if larger), but since the table given doesn't show any other matches for Hawthorn as away, maybe it's not supported.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim refers to all matches in this table, then St Kilda has the highest score as an away team. Therefore, the claim is false because Hawthorn didn't have the highest away points on that day or in the provided data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"hawthorn be the away team with the highest point ever record,\" we need to examine if Hawthorn's away performance is superior to all other away teams in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Hawthorn as an Away Team**: In the table, Hawthorn appears once as the away team against Essendon on April 24, 1965, scoring 6.8 (44).\n\n2. **Compare with Other Away Teams**:\n   - North Melbourne: 10.12 (72)\n   - Richmond: 9.10 (64)\n   - Geelong: 9.11 (65)\n   - St Kilda: 12.12 (84)\n   - Fitzroy: 9.4 (58)\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Score**: The highest score among away teams is St Kilda with 12.12 (84), which is higher than Hawthorn's 6.8 (44).\n\nSince Hawthorn's score is not the highest among all away teams in the provided data, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n**Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells are those where Hawthorn is the away team and their score is recorded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns relevant to the claim are \"home team score,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\" Since the claim is about the 1977 season, I should check if Essendon played as a home team in that year.\n\nWait, the table's date column shows \"24 april 1965\" for all games. That seems off because 1965 is not 1977. Maybe it's a typo or incorrect data. But since all dates are April 1965, perhaps the table isn't about 1977 after all. If that's the case, then the claim can't be true because Essendon didn't play in 1977 as per the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me focus on the data provided. The claim is about the 1977 season, but the table only has games from April 1965. So the data might not pertain to 1977 at all.

The \"home team score\" for Essendon isn't in the table since it's from 1965, not 1977. Therefore, we can't confirm if they had the highest score in 1977 because the data doesn't support that year.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user made a mistake with the date. If I consider that the claim refers to 1965, but it's about Essendon having the highest home team score, then I need to check their score against others in 1965. Looking at the table:\n\n- Essendon: 20.18 (138)\n- Other home teams like Melbourne (11.14), Collingwood (11.13), Carlton (8.11), South Melbourne (7.9), and Footscray (8.6) have lower scores.\n\nSo if the claim is about 1965, Essendon indeed has the highest score as a home team in that year. But since the date in the table is 1965, not 1977, maybe the user intended 1965 but stated 1977 incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the claim should be about 1965.\n\nBut strictly based on the given data, if we have to check the 1977 season, which isn't represented here, then the claim can't be supported because there's no relevant data. However, if I consider that the table might be for 1977 but the date is a mistake, and proceed under the assumption that it's about home team performance in their own games, then perhaps Essendon did have a high score.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"in the 1977 season,\" so without data from 1977, we can't confirm. Therefore, I think the answer should be FALSE because there's no data supporting Essendon's highest home score in 1977.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about Essendon having the highest home team score in the 1977 season. However, all games listed in the table are from April 1965, not 1977. Since the table doesn't provide data for 1977, we can't verify the claim based on the given information.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence in the 1965 season.\" So I need to check the table provided to see if this statement holds.\n\nFirst, I should look for any rows where the home team is melbourne and the venue is mcg. From the table, there's only one such row: row index 0. The crowd number there is 21,744.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this attendance was the highest among all the venues in the 1965 season. To do that, I should look at all the rows and find out which venue had the highest crowd number on that date, April 24, 1965.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- melbourne vs north melbourne at mcg: 21,744\n- essendon vs hawthorn at windy hill: 20,500\n- collingwood vs richmond at victoria park: 31,370\n- carlton vs geelong at princes park: 34,945\n- south melbourne vs st kilda at lake oval: 23,979\n- footscray vs fitzroy at western oval: 16,998\n\nNow, comparing these numbers:\n\nThe highest number is 34,945, which is the attendance at princes park. So, mcg's 21,744 is not the highest.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence.\" I think \"2cd\" might be a typo for \"highest\" or \"most.\" If it's about being second in attendance, then I need to see if mcg was second. Let's list them from highest to lowest:\n\n1. princes park: 34,945\n2. victoria park: 31,370\n3. mcg: 21,744\n4. windy hill: 20,500\n5. lake oval: 23,979\n6. western oval: 16,998\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because 34,945 is the highest, then 31,370 (victoria park), then mcg at 21,744, then 23,979 (lake oval), etc.\n\nSo mcg isn't even in the top two. Therefore, it can't be second. The claim says \"2cd most attendence,\" which I think means second highest. But since mcg is third, the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that mcg was the second highest. But according to the numbers, that's not the case. Princes park had the highest, and victoria park was second. So the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the McG venue had the second-highest attendance in the 1965 season. However, based on the table, Princes Park (carlton vs Geelong) had the highest attendance at 34,945, and Victoria Park (Collingwood vs Richmond) was second with 31,370 attendees. Since McG only had 21,744 attendees, it doesn't rank second. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Geelong get a higher score than North Melbourne as an away team.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is making two points: one about Geelong's score and another about North Melbourne's score, specifically when they are away teams.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several matches with details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match on the same date, April 24, 1965. That means all these games happened on that day.\n\nNow, I need to find where Geelong is listed as an away team and North Melbourne is also an away team. Wait, no\u2014actually, each game has one home team and one away team. So I should look for rows where the away team is either Geelong or North Melbourne, and see their scores.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Melbourne (11.14), away is North Melbourne (10.12). So here, away team is North Melbourne with a score of 10.12.\n2. Row 1: Home is Essendon (20.18) vs Hawthorn (6.8).\n3. Row 2: Home Collingwood (11.13) vs Richmond (9.10).\n4. Row 3: Home Carlton (8.11) vs Geelong (9.11). So here, away team is Geelong with a score of 9.11.\n5. Row 4: Home South Melbourne (7.9) vs St Kilda (12.12).\n6. Row 5: Home Footscray (8.6) vs Fitzroy (9.4).\n\nSo in row 3, Geelong is the away team with a score of 9.11. In row 0, North Melbourne is the away team with 10.12.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Geelong get a higher score than North Melbourne as an away team.\" So I need to compare Geelong's away score to North Melbourne's away score.\n\nLooking at their scores: Geelong scored 9.11, while North Melbourne scored 10.12. Comparing these, 10 is higher than 9 in the first part of the score, and 12 is higher than 11 in the second part. So North Melbourne scored higher than Geelong as an away team.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Geelong get a higher score than North Melbourne as an away team\" is false because their scores are actually 9.11 vs 10.12.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because, as away teams, North Melbourne scored 10.12 while Geelong scored 9.11.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
