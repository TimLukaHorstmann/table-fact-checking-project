    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"Alabama be the opponent when they play at Legion Field Birmingham, AL.\" So the claim is saying that Alabama was the opponent in a game played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it's structured with columns for date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. The rows list various games with different dates, opponents, locations, results, and attendances.\n\nI need to find if there is any row where the opponent is \"Alabama\" and the site is \"Legion Field Birmingham, AL.\" \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. September 5: Opponent is Virginia Tech, site is Lane Stadium Blacksburg, VA. Doesn't match.\n2. September 12: Opponent Chattanooga, site Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium Greenville, NC. No match.\n3. September 19: Opponent Ohio, site Peden Stadium Athens, OH. No.\n4. October 3: Army opponent, Dowdy-Ficklen again in Greenville, SC. Nope.\n5. October 10: UAB vs Dowdy-Ficklen. Not Alabama or Legion Field.\n6. October 17: Opponent is Alabama, but the site is Legion Field Birmingham, AL. Wait, that's exactly what we're looking for! So on October 17, opponent is Alabama, and the site is Legion Field in Birmingham, AL.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The claim says \"when they play at Legion Field,\" so it's about when Alabama is playing elsewhere at Legion Field? Or is the claim saying that Alabama is the opponent when their game is played at Legion Field?\n\nI think the claim is stating that Alabama was the opponent in a game that took place at Legion Field Birmingham, AL. So looking for a row where opponent is Alabama and site is Legion Field Birmingham.\n\nLooking again: On October 17, the opponent is Alabama, and the site is Legion Field, Birmingham, AL. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nTherefore, this supports the claim being true. I should check if there are any other relevant cells but in this case, only one row fits both conditions.\n\nSo the answer is TRUE, with the relevant cell being the October 17 row, columns for opponent and site.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"on november 14 louisville play at dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see if it matches any entries in the table.\n\nStarting with the date: November 14. Scanning through the table, I see that there's an entry for November 14 under the 'date' column. The opponent listed is Louisville. So that seems to match on two points.\n\nNext, the location is \"dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc\". Checking the 'site' column in the table, several entries have this exact site name: September 12, October 3, October 10, November 14, and others. Since November 14 is indeed one of them, that matches too.\n\nSo putting it together, both the date (November 14) and the opponent (Louisville) are present in the same row under 'site' as \"dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be 80079 crowd attendance when alabama be the opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that there was an attendance of 80,079 when Alabama was the opponent. So I'm looking for a row in the table where the opponent is Alabama and the attendance column has exactly 80,079.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a game with specific details: date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. The last row before the header seems to be a separator, so I should ignore that. Each data row after that goes from September 5 to November 21.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find where Alabama is the opponent and what the attendance was for that game.\n\n1. **September 5**: Opponent is Virginia Tech. Attendance is 48,134. Not matching.\n2. **September 12**: Opponent is Chattanooga. Attendance is 34,028. Doesn't match.\n3. **September 19**: Opponent is Ohio. Attendance is 19,186. No match.\n4. **October 3**: Opponent is Army. Attendance is 40,607. Not Alabama.\n5. **October 10**: Opponent is UAB. Attendance is 31,002. Still not Alabama.\n6. **October 17**: Opponent is Alabama. Here we go! Let me check the attendance for this game.\n\nLooking at the \"attendance\" column under October 17: It's listed as 80,079.\n\nSo yes, when Alabama was the opponent on October 17, the crowd attendance was 80,079.\n\nNow I need to confirm that there's no other row where Alabama is the opponent with a different attendance. From the table, only one game features Alabama against UAB on October 17 with 80,079 attendees.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"there be 31002 crowd attendance when UAB be the opponent.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a specific attendance number and a specific opponent, which is UAB. So, I need to look for rows where the opponent is UAB and see if the attendance matches 31002.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: date, opponent, site, result, attendance. The opponent column will tell me when UAB was the opponent. Let me scan through the opponents:\n\n- September 5: Virginia Tech\n- September 12: Chattanooga\n- September 19: Ohio\n- October 3: Army\n- October 10: UAB\n- October 17: Alabama\n- October 24: Southern Miss\n- October 31: Houston\n- November 5: Cincinnati\n- November 14: Louisville\n- November 21: Memphis\n\nSo, on October 10, the opponent is UAB. Now I need to check the attendance for that row. \n\nLooking at the attendance column:\n- September 5: 48134\n- September 12: 34028\n- September 19: 19186\n- October 3: 40607\n- October 10: 31002 (this matches)\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, when UAB is the opponent on October 10, the attendance was 31002. That's exactly what the claim states. So, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The date is October 10, and the opponent is UAB. Attendance is the column that matches, so their row indices and column names would be:\n\n- For October 10: row index 4 (since it's zero-based), column \"attendance\".\n- Opponent UAB is in row 4 as well.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because on the date when UAB was the opponent, the attendance was indeed 31002.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"On September 12, the attendance was 34028 against the opponent Chattanooga.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has columns: date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific game on a particular date against a certain opponent with details about the venue, outcome, and how many people attended.\n\nThe claim mentions September 12 specifically. So I need to find the row where the date is September 12. Scanning through the dates in the table: the first entry is September 5, then 12, 19, etc. So that's the second row (index 1 since it starts at 0).\n\nLooking at that row, the opponent is Chattanooga. The claim also mentions attendance being 34,028 against Chattanooga on September 12. In the table, for September 12, attendance is listed as 34,028.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes dates might be off or there could be a mistake in the data entry. Let's confirm:\n\n- Date: September 12\n- Opponent: Chattanooga\n- Attendance: 34028\n\nYes, all three pieces of information match exactly what the claim states. So the claim is supported by this row.\n\nNow, about the attendance number. Sometimes attendance figures can vary or might be reported differently, but here it's a direct match. No discrepancies noticed.\n\nTherefore, since all the claimed numbers and details align perfectly with the corresponding row in the table, the statement must be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"alabama be the opponent when the attendance be 81079.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game, with details on who the opponent was, where it was played, the outcome, and how many people attended.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things: \"alabama\" being the opponent and the attendance being 81079. So, I need to check if there's a row where the opponent is Alabama and the attendance matches exactly 81079.\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table one by one to see if any meet these criteria. Let me list out the rows with their details:\n\n1. September 5: Opponent - Virginia Tech, Attendance - 48134\n2. September 12: Opponent - Chattanooga, Attendance - 34028\n3. September 19: Opponent - Ohio, Attendance - 19186\n4. October 3: Opponent - Army, Attendance - 40607\n5. October 10: Opponent - UAB, Attendance - 31002\n6. October 17: Opponent - Alabama, Attendance - 80079\n7. October 24: Opponent - Southern Miss, Attendance - 24020\n8. October 31: Opponent - Houston, Attendance - 26821\n9. November 5: Opponent - Cincinnati, Attendance - 19098\n10. November 14: Opponent - Louisville, Attendance - 26258\n11. November 21: Opponent - Memphis, Attendance - 16052\n\nWait, the last row is a bit different; it says \"all times are in eastern\" repeated for each column. That might be a header or something, but I think those rows are meant to indicate that all times (which would correspond to the date) and other columns are in Eastern time zone, so maybe they shouldn't be considered as game data. So I can probably ignore those last three rows since they don't have actual opponent or attendance data.\n\nNow, looking for \"alabama\" as the opponent: from the list above, row 6 is October 17 against Alabama with an attendance of 80079. The claim says attendance should be 81079, but in this case, it's 80,079. Hmm, wait a second\u2014wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table, the attendance for October 17 is listed as 80079. Let me count: 8-0-0-7-9, which is 80,079. The claim says attendance is 81,079. So that's a difference of 1,000. That doesn't match.\n\nIs there another row with Alabama as the opponent? Scanning through again, I don't see any other rows where the opponent is Alabama besides October 17. So in that case, the only row with Alabama has attendance of 80,079, not 81,079.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the numbers. Let me double-check the table. The sixth row: date October 17, opponent Alabama, site Legion Field Birmingham AL, result L22 - 23, and attendance 80079. So that's correct\u2014attendance is 80,079, not 81,079.\n\nSo does any other row have Alabama as the opponent? Let me check again:\n\n- November 21: Opponent is Memphis, so no.\n- November 14: Opponent Louisville, no.\n- November 5: Cincinnati, nope.\n- October 31: Houston, nope.\n- October 24: Southern Miss, no.\n- October 17: Yes, Alabama with 80079 attendance.\n- Then earlier ones don't have Alabama.\n\nSo the only time Alabama is the opponent is on October 17 with 80,079 attendees. Since the claim says 81,079, which doesn't match any row where Alabama was the opponent, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nWait, but I should also check if there's another row where attendance is exactly 81,079 and opponent is Alabama. But looking through all the rows:\n\n- The highest attendance is 80,879? Wait no, in the table, November 21 has attendance 16052, which is much lower. Wait, let me list out all attendance numbers for clarity:\n\n1. 48134\n2. 34028\n3. 19186\n4. 40607\n5. 31002\n6. 80079\n7. 24020\n8. 26821\n9. 19098\n10. 26258\n11. 16052\n\nWait, the highest is 80,079, so there's no row with attendance 81,079. So even if I consider that maybe it's a typo and they meant 80079, but in any case, the claim specifies 81079, which isn't present.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by any data in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",
