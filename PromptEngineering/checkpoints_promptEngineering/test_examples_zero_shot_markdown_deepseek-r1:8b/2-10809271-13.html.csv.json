    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"prince park be home to the carlton team.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided in markdown format. There are several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a match between two teams with their respective scores, venue, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions \"prince park\" as the home venue for the carlton team. So I need to check if in any of the rows where the home team is Carlton, the venue is Prince's Park.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first row: Home team is Essendon, venue Windy Hill. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: Collingwood vs South Melbourne at Victoria Park. Not Carlton or Prince Park.\n3. Third row: Carlton is the home team. Venue is Princes Park. Oh, that's exactly what we're looking for!\n4. Fourth row: Richmond vs North Melbourne at Punt Road Oval. Not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: St Kilda vs Melbourne at Junction Oval. No.\n6. Sixth row: Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park. Nope.\n\nSo the third row is where Carlton plays at Prince's Park. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a match where Carlton is the home team and their venue is Prince's Park on 14 July 1945.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other instances. Let me check again. Only one instance of Carlton being the home team, and that's at Princes Park. So yes, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the third row where the Carlton team is listed as the home team with the venue as Princes Park.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
