    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"anne street have no major junction in the milepost\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions \"Anne Street\" and says there are \"no major junctions in the milepost.\" So, I need to check if Anne Street has any major intersections listed under its mileposts.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"county,\" \"location,\" \"street names,\" \"milepost,\" \"roads intersected,\" and \"notes.\" The claim specifically mentions \"Anne Street,\" so I'll focus on that column. \n\nIn the table, Anne Street appears in two rows: one for Norfolk and Weymouth, but actually, looking closer, only the row for Weymouth has \"Anne Street\" as a street name. Wait, no\u2014the first row is Norfolk and Stoughton, the second is Norfolk and Weymouth, so Anne Street is under location Weymouth. \n\nIn that row, the milepost is listed as (no major junctions), roads intersected are also (no major junctions), and notes say the same. So, for Anne Street in Weymouth, there's no major junctions recorded.\n\nNow, does this directly support the claim? The claim states that \"Anne Street have no major junction in the milepost.\" But looking at the table, the data is presented as \"(no major junctions)\" under both milepost and roads intersected for Anne Street. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are the row where location is Weymouth, street names is Anne Street. That would be row index 1 (since it's zero-indexed). The columns to check are \"milepost\" and \"roads intersected,\" as they both show \"no major junctions.\"\n\nTherefore, since both milepost and roads intersected for Anne Street in Weymouth have no major junctions, the claim is TRUE. \n\nI need to make sure I'm only selecting the relevant cells correctly. The row index is 1 because it's the second entry. The columns are \"milepost\" and \"roads intersected.\" So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"milepost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"roads intersected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"north avenue plain street market street have both 12.2 and 12.8 list in the milepost column.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's stating that there are entries for north avenue plain street market street with mileposts of both 12.2 and 12.8. So, I need to check if this specific street name appears twice in the milepost column at those two numbers.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should go through each row and see which ones match the street name mentioned. The columns are county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes.\n\nI notice that the street name \"north avenue plain street market street\" appears in rows 2 and 3 of the table, both under the location column. So, let's check those two rows specifically for the milepost.\n\nIn row 2 (plymouth | rockland), the milepost is 12.8. In row 3 (same location), the milepost is 12.2. So yes, there are entries at both 12.2 and 12.8 for that street name.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"north avenue plain street market street\" has mileposts of 12.2 and 12.8 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"milepost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"milepost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"route 24 intersects with pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if route 24 is mentioned and if it intersects with the specified streets.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- County: norfolk\n- Location: stoughton\n- Street names: pleasant street, turnpike street, lindelof avenue\n- Milepost: 3.0\n- Roads intersected: route 24\n\nSo, in this case, route 24 is indeed one of the roads intersected by these streets. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by this row.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might have conflicting information. The second row talks about route 24 exit 20 but doesn't mention intersections with those specific streets. The other rows are about different routes and locations, so they don't affect this particular claim.\n\nThus, since the table confirms that route 24 intersects with pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue in stoughton, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"roads intersected\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

So this seems accurate.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells that could affect this conclusion.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"anne street be located in plymouth county and have no major junction for milepost or road intersect.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. Anne Street is located in Plymouth County.\n2. Anne Street has no major junctions, and this is reflected in both the milepost and roads intersected columns.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each part of the claim by examining the relevant cells.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking if Anne Street is in Plymouth County. Scanning through the table's location column:\n\n- The first row has \"stoughton\" under location.\n- Second row has \"weymouth.\"\n- Third and fourth rows have \"rockland.\"\n- Fifth row has \"hanover.\"\n\nWait, I don't see any entry for Anne Street here. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. Oh, the second row lists Anne Street as part of Weymouth in Norfolk County.\n\nSo, according to the table, Anne Street is located in Weymouth, which is in Norfolk County, not Plymouth. That already contradicts the first part of the claim. So, the claim's first assertion is false because Anne Street isn't in Plymouth.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The claim says \"plymouth county,\" and I need to confirm if Anne Street is indeed in Plymouth. Since it's listed under Weymouth in Norfolk County, that's incorrect.\n\nMoving on to the second part of the claim: checking for major junctions. In the table, each row has a 'notes' column. For Anne Street (second row), the notes say \"(no major junctions).\" So that part seems correct because there are no major junctions noted.\n\nHowever, the first part is wrong, so even if the second part is true, the overall claim is false because it incorrectly states the county location of Anne Street.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim's first assertion about Anne Street being in Plymouth County is incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"plymouth county have 2 location , rockland and stroughton.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions Plymouth County having two locations: Rockland and Stoughton. So, I should look at the table to see if Plymouth County indeed has those two locations listed.\n\nLooking at the table, the counties are either Norfolk or Plymouth in the first column. Under Plymouth, there are three entries for different locations: Rockland, Rockland (with different mileposts), and Hanover. Wait, that's only three locations for Plymouth County. But the claim says there are two: Rockland and Stoughton.\n\nWait a second, does the table have a location called Stoughton in Plymouth County? Scanning through the table, I see Norfolk has Stoughton and Weymouth, but under Plymouth, I don't see Stoughton at all. The locations listed are Rockland and Hanover. So, the claim is stating that Plymouth has two locations: Rockland and Stoughton. However, according to the table, Stoughton isn't a location in Plymouth County\u2014it's in Norfolk.\n\nSo, the claim seems incorrect because while Plymouth does have Rockland, it doesn't have Stoughton as another location.

Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that Hanover in Plymouth County intersects Route 123. So, I'm looking for information about Hanover that relates to Route 123 in Plymouth County.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes. The rows are individual entries with specific data.\n\nI need to find any row where the location is Hanover in Plymouth County and check if Route 123 is mentioned among the roads intersected or in the notes.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: county is Norfolk, so it's not relevant since we're looking for Plymouth.\n2. Second row: county is Norfolk again, same reason.\n3. Third row: county is Plymouth. Location is Rockland. The street names are north avenue plain street market street. Milepost is 12.2, roads intersected are route 123, and notes mention the western terminus of route 123/139 concurrency. So this seems relevant because Route 123 is mentioned here.\n4. Fourth row: county is Plymouth, location Rockland again, but different milepost and other details. Roads intersected is still route 123, so this might also be relevant.\n5. Fifth row: county is Plymouth, location Hanover. Street names are hanover street rockland street columbia road. Milepost 17.9, roads intersected is route 53, and notes about Route 53/139 concurrency.\n\nSo, the fifth row is for Hanover in Plymouth County. It says that at milepost 17.9, the roads intersected are route 53. The note mentions it's the northern terminus of route 53/139 concurrency. There's no mention of Route 123 here.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there's any intersection between Hanover and Route 123. From the table, in the third row (Rockland), Route 123 is intersected at milepost 12.2 and 12.8 with other routes. But that's for Rockland, not Hanover.\n\nSo, the claim says Hanover intersects Route 123. Looking at the table, the only intersection in Plymouth County involving Route 123 is in Rockland, not Hanover. The fifth row about Hanover mentions Route 53, not 123.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table that Hanover specifically intersects Route 123. The intersections for Route 123 are in Rockland, and Hanover's intersection is with Route 53.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because there's no data supporting that Hanover in Plymouth County intersects Route 123.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"roads intersected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a specific intersection or point in different counties and locations.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"milepost 12.8\" and \"weymouth.\" So, my goal is to find if there's a row where the milepost is exactly 12.8 and the location is weymouth.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row is for norfolk county in stoughton with a milepost of 3.0.\n2. The second row is for norfolk in weymouth, but it shows no major junctions. The milepost here isn't specified because it's just \"(no major junctions)\" which might mean the milepost isn't applicable or provided.\n3. Third and fourth rows are about plymouth county in rockland with mileposts 12.2 and 12.8 respectively.\n4.
