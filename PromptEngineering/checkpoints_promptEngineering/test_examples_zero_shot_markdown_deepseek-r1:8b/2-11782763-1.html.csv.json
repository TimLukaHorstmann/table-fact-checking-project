    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"william adelin be the only 1 who became heir due to birth\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim suggests that William Adelin was the sole individual who became heir because of his birth. Looking at the table, I need to check all the entries where someone became heir and see if William Adelin was the only one who inherited the position due to being born.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row in the table to identify the relevant information. The key columns here seem to be \"heir,\" \"became heir,\" and \"reason.\" Each row represents a different individual who was an heir at some point, along with details about their ascension and the reasons behind it.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Robert Curthose: He became heir presumptive in 1066 because his father became king. The reason is noted as \"father became king,\" which suggests inheritance through lineage rather than birth alone. However, there's another entry for him later that might affect this analysis.\n\n2. Succession unclear from 1077-1087: This row talks about unclear succession during those years but doesn't mention William Adelin yet.\n\n3. Robert Curthose again: Now he's the heir presumptive by being the elder brother in 1087, decided by agreement. Again, his becoming heir is due to being an elder sibling, not solely because of birth.\n\n4. Henry Beauclerc: He became heir presumptive in 1088 after Robert's rebellion. The reason is Robert's rebellion, so again, it's about succession through conflict rather than just birth.\n\n5. Succession unclear from 1100-1103: Another unclear period, not directly related to William Adelin.\n\n6. William Adelin: He became heir apparent in 1103, described as the only son, with his becoming heir due to being born. The reason is \"born,\" which fits the claim.\n\n7. Empress Matilda: She was heiress presumptive and became so in 1120, even though her brother died later. Her status changed after her brother's death, but initially, she was an heiress because of birth as the only child.\n\nWait, let me clarify this. The row for William Adelin says he became heir apparent in 1103 due to being born, and the reason is \"born.\" For Matilda, it states she was heiress presumptive from 1120, with her becoming so when her brother died in 1127, but initially, she was the only child. So her becoming heiress was due to birth as well.\n\nNow, checking the claim again: it says William Adelin is the only one who became heir due to birth. But according to the table, both William Adelin and Empress Matilda became heirs (or heiresses) because of their births\u2014William as the only son, Matilda as the only child. However, the key here is whether they were the only ones in the table.\n\nLooking at other entries:\n\n- Robert Curthose: Became heir due to father becoming king, not just birth.\n- Henry Beauclerc: Became heir due to rebellion, not birth.\n- The unclear succession periods don't affect individuals' reasons for becoming heir.\n- Empress Matilda: Her initial status as heiress presumptive was because she's the only child (birth), but her actual becoming heiress happened later when her brother died.\n\nWait, the row for William Adelin says he became heir apparent in 1103 due to being born, and the reason is \"born.\" The Empress Matilda's row mentions that she was heiress presumptive by 1120, but she actually became heiress when her brother died. However, the initial declaration of her being heiress was because she was the only child.\n\nSo both William Adelin and Matilda were declared heirs (or heiresses) based on their birth. Additionally, Robert Curthose's first entry was as heir presumptive in 1066, but that was because his father became king, not just due to birth. His second entry in 1087 was through agreement with his brother.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"only William Adelin\" became heir due to birth. But Matilda also did so initially. However, she actually inherited her position later when her brother died, but at first, it was because of being born as the only child. So does that count? The row for Matilda shows she became heiress presumptive in 1120 and was proclaimed in 1127 after her brother's death. But the initial reason is stated as \"brother died,\" not directly birth.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nFor Matilda: \"became heir\" column says \"25 november 1120 proclaimed 1127.\" The reason is \"brother died.\" So perhaps she didn't become heiress initially due to birth but through her brother's death. Therefore, maybe only William Adelin became heir due to being born.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the rows again carefully.\n\nRow for Matilda:\n\n- heir: Empress Matilda\n- status: heiress presumptive\n- relationship: only child\n- became heir: 25 november 1120 proclaimed 1127\n- reason: brother died\n- ceased to be: 1 december 1135 (22 december 1135)\n- monarch: henry i\n\nSo, she was declared heiress presumptive in 1120 but actually became heiress when her brother died in 1127. The reason given for becoming heiress is \"brother died,\" not birth. Therefore, her becoming heiress wasn't directly due to birth but through her brother's death.\n\nIn contrast, William Adelin was declared heir apparent in 1103 because he was the only son (born), and that's explicitly stated as the reason: \"reason\" column says \"born.\" So his becoming heir was solely due to being born.\n\nTherefore, looking at all the rows:\n\n- Robert Curthose: became heir through father's kingship or agreement.\n- Henry Beauclerc: became heir through rebellion.\n- William Adelin: became heir because he was born.\n- Empress Matilda: became heiress after her brother died, not because of birth.\n\nSo only William Adelin became heir due to being born. The claim says \"william adelin be the only 1 who became heir due to birth.\" So this is TRUE based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table and see what information is relevant. The table has several columns: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, and monarch.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions two people: Henry Beauclerc and Robert Curthose. So I should focus on rows where either of their names appears in the 'heir' column or any other relevant columns.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about Robert Curthose. It says he became heir presumptive in 1066. He was the son of William I, and then in 1077, his status changed. So this is about Robert's time as an heir, not Henry's. But maybe it's relevant because the claim mentions Robert being before Henry.\n\n2. The second row seems to be a continuation of the succession issues after 1077, but it doesn't mention either Robert or Henry specifically, so I can skip this unless needed.\n\n3. The third row again talks about Robert Curthose becoming heir presumptive in 1087, this time as the elder brother of William II. So he became heir in 1087, which is a few years before 1088 mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. Now, the fourth row is about Henry Beauclerc. It says he became heir presumptive in 1088. The reason given is Robert's rebellion. Also, it mentions that Henry ceased to be heir on 2 August 1100. So this directly relates to Henry becoming heir in 1088.\n\nComparing this to the claim: \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose.\" \n\nLooking at Robert Curthose's information, he became heir in 1066 and again in 1087. Wait, in the third row, he became heir in 1087, which is before Henry in 1088. So actually, Henry became heir a year after Robert, not the other way around. The claim says Henry became heir a year after Robert, but according to the table, Robert was heir in 1087 and Henry in 1088, so that would make sense as Henry becoming a year after Robert.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In the third row (row index 3), Robert Curthose became heir presumptive in 1087, and Henry in the fourth row (index 4) became heir in 1088. So yes, Henry is a year after Robert.\n\nSo the claim seems to be TRUE because according to the table, Henry Beauclerc did become heir in 1088, which was a year after Robert Curthose became heir in 1087.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose,\" we need to check relevant cells in the table. The key rows are:\n\n- **Row 3**: Robert Curthose became heir presumptive in 1087 as William II's elder brother.\n- **Row 4**: Henry Beauclerc became heir presumptive in 1088, following Robert's rebellion.\n\nHenry indeed became heir a year after Robert, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"only 2 heir have son as their relationship to monarch.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and identify which heirs have a \"son\" listed under the \"relationship to monarch\" column. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. Robert Curthose is the first heir. His relationship is \"son,\" so that's one.\n2. Next, there's another Robert Curthose, same as above. Another son, making it two.\n3. Then Henry Beauclerc: his relationship is \"younger brother.\" Not a son, so doesn't count.\n4. William Adelin: his relationship is \"only son,\" which does count. That would be three if I consider this.\n5. Empress Matilda's relationship is \"heiress presumptive,\" not a son.\n\nWait, the third heir, Henry Beauclerc, is an elder brother, so he's not a son. The fourth one, William Adelin, is described as the only son, so that would be a third heir with a son relationship. \n\nBut wait, let me check the table again:\n\n- Row 0: Robert Curthose - son\n- Row 1: same person, but different status? Wait, no. The table seems to have multiple entries for the same heir. Let me count each unique heir.\n\nWait, in row 0 and row 1, it's Robert Curthose listed twice with different statuses (heir presumptive both times). So does that count as two separate instances or one? I think each row is a separate entry, so maybe we should consider each occurrence.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 2 heir have son.\" So if there are three heirs with \"son\" relationships, then the claim would be false. But wait:\n\n- Robert Curthose: son (row 0)\n- Robert Curthese again: son (row1)? Or is it the same entry?\n\nWait, looking at the table more carefully, it seems that each row is a separate entry, but some might be about the same person. For example, rows 0 and 1 are both about Robert Curthose with different statuses.\n\nSo in the first instance, he's heir presumptive as son of William I. In the second instance, he's heir presumptive as elder brother of William II. Wait, that can't be right because William II would have been a later monarch. So perhaps rows 0 and 1 are about different periods, so maybe both instances count.\n\nBut wait, in row 3: Henry Beauclerc is the heir presumptive as younger brother of William II. Then in row4: succession unclear, same person? Maybe not. Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the table, each entry has a 'monarch' column. So for example, row0's monarch is William I, row1's is also William I, but maybe about a different time.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all unique heirs and see how many have \"son\" as their relationship:\n\n- Robert Curthose: listed twice, both times with \"son.\" So that's two.\n- Henry Beauclerc: listed once, younger brother. Not son.\n- William Adelin: listed once, only son. That's three.\n- Empress Matilda: listed once, heiress presumptive.\n\nWait, but in the table, row0 and row1 are both Robert Curthose, each with \"son\" as their relationship to different monarchs (William I and then William II). So that would count as two instances for Robert. Then William Adelin is another one, so three heirs with \"son\" relationships.\n\nTherefore, the claim says only 2 heirs have sons. But in reality, there are at least three: Robert Curthose twice and William Adelin once. Wait, but the table might be structured such that each row is a separate event or designation, so even if it's the same person, each occurrence counts. So Robert is counted twice as having \"son\" relationship.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"only 2 heir have son.\" So it's about unique heirs, not instances. Or does it count each instance? The wording isn't clear, but usually, in such contexts, it refers to unique individuals. So Robert Curthose is one, William Adelin is another. That makes two.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for each heir's relationship to the monarch is \"relationship to monarch.\" We need to count how many unique heirs have \"son\" in that column.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Robert Curthose: son\n- William Adelin: only son\n\nSo two unique heirs. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE because only 2 heirs (Robert and William) have a son relationship.\n\nWait, but Henry Beauclerc is described as a younger brother, not a son. So that's correct. So yes, only Robert and William are sons, so two heirs. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states \"only 2 heir have son as their relationship to monarch.\" Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Robert Curthose** is listed twice with \"son\" as his relationship to William I and William II. However, this is the same individual, so it counts as one unique heir.\n- **William Adelin** is also listed as having an \"only son\" relationship, making it two unique heirs.\n\nNo other heirs have a \"son\" in their relationship to the monarch. Therefore, only 2 unique heirs meet the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"henry beauclerc cease to be heir on 2 august 1100 , follow by william adelin 20 year later.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any mention of Henry Beauclerc and William Adelin in relation to ceasing to be an heir.\n\nStarting with the first rows:\n\n- The first entry is Robert Curthose becoming heir presumptive in 1066. Not relevant.\n- Then there's a succession unclear period from 1077-1087, but it doesn't mention Henry or William Adelin.\n- Next, Robert Curthose again in 1087, still not the right people.\n- Henry Beauclerc becomes heir presumptive in 1088, so that's when he takes on the role.\n\nNow, looking for when Henry stops being heir. The next relevant row after his appointment is when William Adelin becomes heir apparent in 1103. So between 1088 and 1103, Henry was an heir. Therefore, when did he cease?\n\nLooking further down, there's a period of succession unclear from 1100-1103. Then, in the same year, William Adelin becomes heir apparent. However, the claim says Henry ceases on 2 August 1100, which is during the unclear period.\n\nChecking the rows again: The entry for Henry Beauclerc as heir presumptive is in 1088, and he holds that role until 1103 when William Adelin takes over. There's no row indicating that Henry specifically ceased being heir on 2 August 1100. Instead, the succession was unclear from 1100-1103, which suggests there might have been a transition or uncertainty during that time.\n\nFurthermore, the claim mentions that after Henry ceases, William Adelin follows 20 years later. However, based on the table, William Adelin becomes heir apparent in 1103 and is mentioned as such until he ceases in 1120. So the timeline doesn't align with a 20-year gap between their tenures.\n\nTherefore, the claim's specific dates and the sequence don't match the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: Robert Curthose was the heir twice, once in 1066 and again in 1087. So, I need to check if the table supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different heir with various details. I notice that there are multiple entries for Robert Curthose:\n\n1. The first row (row index 0) says Robert Curthose was heir presumptive in 1066, became heir in 1066, and his status changed to \"heir presumptive\" again in 1077. But the reason he became heir in 1066 is because his father became king. Then, in 1087, he's listed as heir presumptive with a different relationship (elder brother) and became heir in 1088 due to an agreement, but he ceased being heir in 1088.\n\nWait, so in 1066, Robert was the heir presumptive but not yet the actual heir. In 1087, he became the heir again because his brother, William II, made him heir by agreement, and he became heir in 1087? Wait, no: looking at the table, under \"became heir\" for row index 2 (the third entry), it's 1087, and the reason is by agreement. So Robert was declared as heir presumptive again in 1087, and then became heir in 1088.\n\nBut the claim says he was heir in both 1066 and 1087. However, the table shows that he was heir presumptive in 1066 but didn't actually become heir until 1087 (as per row index 2). Wait, no: row index 0 has \"became heir\" as 1066, so he did become heir in 1066. Then, in 1087, he became heir again because of an agreement by William II, and then he was heir until 1088.\n\nSo Robert Curthose was the heir twice: once in 1066 when his father became king, and again in 1087 as the heir presumptive due to William II's agreement. Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check each relevant cell:\n\n- For row index 0:\n  - \"robert curthose\" is the heir.\n  - Status: heir presumptive.\n  - Became heir: 1066.\n  So this supports his becoming heir in 1066.\n\n- For row index 2 (assuming rows are numbered starting from 0, so it's the third entry):\n  - Heir: robert curthose\n  - Status: heir presumptive\n  - Became heir: 1087\n  - Reason: by agreement\n  So this supports his becoming heir in 1087.\n\nThus, both times he was heir are covered: 1066 and 1087. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Robert Curthose was heir twice, in 1066 and 1087, is supported by the table. He became heir in both years as indicated in rows 0 and 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became_heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became_heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about various heirs and monarchs in medieval times, and there's a claim that I need to verify. The claim is: \"henry beauclerc be the only 1 who became heir due to birth.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column in the table represents. Let me look at the columns:\n\n- heir\n- status\n- relationship to monarch\n- became heir\n- reason\n- ceased to be heir\n- monarch\n\nSo, each row is about a different person being an heir at some point. The claim is specifically about Henry Beauclerc becoming heir due to birth.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find all rows where the \"heir\" is Henry Beauclerc and see how he became heir. From the table:\n\n1. Robert Curthose was an heir presumptive in 1066 but later ceased in 1077.\n2. There's a row with succession unclear from 1077-1087, so maybe not directly about Henry.\n3. Robert Curthose again as heir presumptive in 1087, ceased in 1088.\n4. Henry Beauclerc is listed as heir presumptive in 1088.\n5. Succession unclear from 1100-1103.\n6. William Adelin becomes heir apparent in 1103.\n7. Matilda becomes heiress presumptive in 1120, but her status changed later.\n\nSo focusing on the row where Henry Beauclerc is the heir. The relevant columns here would be \"became heir\" (1088) and \"reason\" which says \"robert's rebellion.\" So Henry became heir due to his birth as a younger brother, specifically after Robert rebelled. \n\nThe claim states he was the only one who became heir due to birth. Now, I need to check if any other heirs in the table also became heir due to their birth.\n\nLooking at other entries:\n\n- Robert Curthose: Became heir in 1066 and again in 1087, reasons include father becoming king and later by agreement.\n- William Adelin: Heir apparent in 1103, born as only son.\n- Matilda: Heiress presumptive from 1120, but her status changed after Henry I died.\n\nSo Robert Curthose's initial succession was because his father became king. Then he was chosen again through an agreement with William II. Henry Beauclerc became heir due to birth as a younger brother. William Adelin was the only son, so that's another case of becoming heir due to being born as the only child.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the only 1\" who became heir due to birth. However, both Henry and William were heirs due to their birth. So the claim is incorrect because there are at least two people: Henry and William Adelin.\n\nBut looking back, the table shows that William Adelin was the heir apparent in 1103, becoming so by being the only son. So he became heir due to his birth as well. Therefore, Henry Beauclerc isn't the only one; William Adelin also fits the condition.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because there are multiple heirs who became such due to their birth, not just Henry.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc was the sole individual who became heir due to birth. However, upon reviewing the table, both Robert Curthose and William Adelin also became heirs based on their births. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** \"FALSE\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It seems like we're focusing on the 'relationship to monarch' column and how it relates to having a daughter. Specifically, we're looking for cases where an heir has a daughter in that specific relationship context.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go row by row and check the relevant columns:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Robert Curthose is described as the heir presumptive with his relationship to William I being his son. The status here doesn't mention having a daughter, so this might not be relevant.\n   \n2. **Row 1**: This row seems to be a placeholder for succession issues during 1077-1087. It mentions Robert Curthose again but doesn't specify family relationships beyond that of an heir presumptive. No info on daughters here.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Robert Curthose is again the heir presumptive, now as his elder brother, under William II. Still no mention of having a daughter.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Henry Beauclerc becomes heir presumptive as the younger brother of William II. Again, no info on daughters.\n\n5. **Row 4**: This row talks about succession being unclear from 1100-1103 under Henry I. No mention of children or daughters here.\n\n6. **Row 5**: William Adelin is the heir apparent and only son of Henry I. He doesn't have a daughter, as he's the only son.\n\n7. **Row 6**: Empress Matilda is named as the heiress presumptive and only child of Henry I. She has a daughter, but her status as an heiress might be separate from being an heir to the throne in this context. Her relationship to the monarch (Henry I) is as his child, and she does have a daughter.\n\nNow, let's see how many heirs (in any capacity: son, elder brother, younger brother, etc.) had daughters:\n\n- **Matilda**: She has a daughter, but was she ever an heir in the context of succeeding to the throne? Her status is as heiress presumptive, which might be a different role than an heir.\n\n- **Other heirs**: Robert Curthose, Henry Beauclerc, William Adelin, and others don't have any daughters mentioned. The claim refers specifically to 'daughters' related to their relationship as heirs.\n\nSo, if we're only considering those who are explicitly named as heirs (presumptive, apparent, etc.), only Matilda's situation might apply. However, she was an heiress rather than an heir, which could be a point of contention.\n\nAdditionally, the table doesn't mention any other daughters from the heirs listed. Therefore, it seems like only one person (Matilda) has a daughter in the context given.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 3 heirs.\" That would mean we need three instances where heirs have daughters. Since I only found one, the claim might be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the 'relationship to monarch' column and the 'reason' for becoming heir. For Matilda, her reason is that her brother died, so she became heiress presumptive. She has a daughter, but she wasn't an heir in the sense of succeeding to the throne; she was an heiress.\n\nPerhaps the table doesn't explicitly state that any of the male heirs (Robert Curthose, Henry Beauclerc, William Adelin) have daughters. So maybe only Matilda is the one who has a daughter in her relationship as a daughter of the monarch. But since she's not listed as an heir but as an heiress, does that count?\n\nThe claim specifies \"heirs,\" so if she isn't considered an heir, then maybe none of them have daughters. Therefore, the number would be zero, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the table, Matilda is referred to as an 'heiress presumptive,' not an 'heir.' So perhaps she's not counted as an heir. The male heirs (like Robert Curthose and others) don't have daughters mentioned. Therefore, there are zero heirs with daughters.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 3,\" which would be FALSE if it's actually zero. However, I might need to double-check if any other heirs have daughters.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Robert Curthose: No mention of daughters.\n- Henry Beauclerc: No mention.\n- William Adelin: Only son; no daughter.\n- Empress Matilda: Heiress, has a daughter, but not an heir in the table's context.\n\nSo yes, only one person (Matilda) is mentioned who has a daughter, and she isn't listed as an heir. Therefore, there are zero heirs with daughters, making the claim FALSE because it states there are three.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"only 3 heirs have daughter as their relationship to monarch\" is not supported by the table data. Upon analysis, only Empress Matilda has a daughter, but she isn't listed as an heir in the table. None of the male heirs mentioned have daughters recorded. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"reason\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"robert curthose became heir in 1094 , a year after empress matilda\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the relevant parts of the table provided. The table lists various heirs, their statuses, relationships, when they became heirs, reasons, when they ceased being heirs, and the monarch involved.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific people: Robert Curthose and Empress Matilda. So, I should focus on rows where these names appear.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- **Robert Curthose** is listed in row 0 and row 2.\n    - In row 0, he became heir presumptive in 1066 because his father became king, and he ceased being heir in 1077.\n    - In row 2, he again became heir presumptive in 1087 by agreement with William II, but he only lasted until 1088.\n\n- **Empress Matilda** is listed in row 5. She was the heiress presumptive from 1103 and became such on November 25, 1120 after her brother died. She ceased being heiress presumptive on December 1, 1135 (22 December 1135).\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim: \"Robert Curthose became heir in 1094, a year after Empress Matilda.\" \n\nThe first part of the claim is about Robert becoming heir in 1094. Looking at the table, Robert was heir presumptive in 1087 (row 2) and again in 1066 (row 0). There's no mention of him becoming heir in 1094. The closest year after that would be 1088 when he ceased being heir in row 2.\n\nThe second part mentions \"a year after Empress Matilda.\" Empress Matilda became heiress presumptive in November 1120 and ceased being so in December 1135. There's a 27-year gap between her becoming heiress and the claim's reference to 1094, which doesn't align with any information about Robert Curthose.\n\nAdditionally, there's no row for Robert Curthose becoming heir in 1094. The only relevant years are 1066, 1087, and 1088. Therefore, the claim's assertion about Robert becoming heir in 1094 is not supported by the table.\n\nSince the table doesn't provide any evidence that Robert Curthose became heir in 1094 or that Empress Matilda was involved in his succession in that year, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there is no evidence in the provided table indicating that Robert Curthose became heir in 1094 or that Empress Matilda's succession occurred around that time.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heiress presumptive\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about William Adelin and Empress Matilda is true based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"William Adelin cease to be heir on 5 August 1119, followed by Empress Matilda 21 years later.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of this statement. The first part talks about William Adelin ceasing to be an heir on a specific date. The second part mentions that Empress Matilda becomes the heir 21 years after that.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns that might support or contradict these points.\n\nStarting with William Adelin: In the table, under the 'heir' column, there's an entry for William Adelin. His status is \"heir apparent,\" which means he was intended to inherit. The row says his succession started in 1103 when Henry I became king, and he was the only son. However, he died on November 25, 1120. But the claim refers to him ceasing to be heir on August 5, 1119. Wait, that's a problem because according to the table, William Adelin died in 1120, not 1119. That means there's an inconsistency here.\n\nNow, looking at Empress Matilda: She is listed as \"heiress presumptive\" with her succession starting on November 25, 1120, and she was the only child. The table also mentions that her status changed to heiress presumptive in 1127 after her brother died, and she became heir upon Henry I's death on December 1, 1135. But the claim says she became heir 21 years after William Adelin, which would be 1120 + 21 = 1141. However, according to the table, she actually became heir in 1135, not 1141. That also doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, there's a row that mentions succession being unclear from 1100-1103 and another about Henry I's reign. But more importantly, the claim incorrectly states the dates for both William Adelin and Empress Matilda.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The table shows William Adelin died in 1120, not 1119, so he couldn't have ceased being heir on August 5, 1119. Also, Empress Matilda didn't become heir 21 years after that; she became heir much later, in 1135. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because William Adelin's death occurred in 1120, not 1119, and Empress Matilda did not become heiress 21 years later.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "robert curthose be the heir 2 time , in 1082 and 1094",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time , in 1082 and 1094\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that Robert Curthose was the heir twice, specifically in the years 1082 and 1094. So I need to check if there are two instances where Robert Curthose became an heir around those times.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different instance of someone becoming an heir. Each row has columns like 'heir,' 'status,' etc. My focus is on the 'became heir' column and the corresponding years to see when Robert Curthose was named as an heir.\n\nStarting with the first row: It's about Robert Curthose, his status as heir presumptive, becoming heir in 1066, with the reason being his father became king. This seems relevant because it mentions Robert as an heir in 1066, but the claim is about 1082 and 1094. So this isn't directly related to the two specific years.\n\nNext, there's a row labeled \"succession unclear 1077 - 1087.\" The heir here is Robert Curthose again. This suggests that during these years, his status as heir was unclear, but it doesn't specify when he became heir beyond that period. It also mentions the reason as succession being unclear. So while this relates to Robert's time as an heir, it doesn't pinpoint 1082 or 1094.\n\nMoving on, there's another row about Robert Curthose in 1087. Here, his status is heir presumptive because of his elder brother's agreement. The became heir year is 1087. This seems closer to the claim but not exactly 1082. Wait, 1087 isn't one of the years mentioned in the claim. The claim says 1082 and 1094. So this might be a point to consider\u2014maybe there was another instance around that time?\n\nThen, the next row is about Henry Beauclerc becoming heir presumptive in 1088 due to Robert's rebellion. Not relevant to Robert Curthose.\n\nThe following rows deal with succession during 1100-1103 and then Henry I's other heirs like William Adelin and Matilda. None of these relate directly to Robert Curthose or the specified years.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me count again:\n\n1. Robert Curthose in 1066.\n2. Succession unclear 1077-1087 (Robert).\n3. Robert again in 1087.\n4. Henry Beauclerc in 1088.\n5. Succession unclear 1100-1103.\n6. William Adelin in 1103.\n7. Matilda in 1120.\n\nSo, only three rows mention Robert Curthose: 1066, 1077-1087, and 1087. The claim is about him becoming heir twice around 1082 and 1094. \n\nIn the table, he becomes heir in 1066, then again in 1087 as heir presumptive. There's a period of succession uncertainty between 1077-1087, but the specific year when he became heir again is 1087. So does that count as becoming heir twice? It seems like there are two instances: 1066 and 1087.\n\nBut the claim mentions 1082 and 1094. The table doesn't show Robert Curthose being named heir in those exact years. In fact, 1087 is the year he became heir again after a period of uncertainty starting in 1077. So the actual becoming happened in 1087, not 1082 or 1094.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The first time was in 1066, and then the second time as heir presumptive in 1087. But does that mean he was named heir twice? Yes, but not necessarily in two specific years as per the claim. The claim says \"in 1082 and 1094.\" So there's a discrepancy because the table shows him becoming heir again in 1087, not 1094.\n\nAdditionally, the second time is when his brother died in 1088, making him heir presumptive in 1087. But he didn't become heir again after that; Henry Beauclerc took over. Wait, no\u2014after Robert became heir presumptive in 1087, he was declared heir in 1088, but the table shows succession as unclear until 1100.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at each row's 'became heir' year:\n\n- Row 0: Robert in 1066.\n- Rows 1 and 2 mention Robert between 1077-1087 and specifically 1087, but it's the same event.\n- Then, Henry Beauclerc becomes heir in 1088.\n\nSo Robert was declared as heir presumptive in 1087, but became heir around that time. The claim is about him being heir twice: once in 1082 and again in 1094. But according to the table, he only became heir twice: first in 1066 and then in 1087. There's no mention of him being heir in 1082 or 1094.\n\nFurthermore, looking at the 'ceased to be heir' column, Robert was replaced by Henry Beauclerc in 1088. So after 1088, he wasn't heir anymore until perhaps later? But in the table, the next time someone is named heir is William Adelin in 1103. So Robert's tenure as heir ended before that.\n\nPutting this together, the claim is stating that Robert was heir twice, specifically in 1082 and 1094. The table shows he was heir in 1066 and again in 1087, but not in 1082 or 1094. Therefore, the claim doesn't align with the table's data.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The second time Robert is heir presumptive is in 1087 because of his elder brother's death. But if his brother died in 1088, then he became heir in 1087? Or was it that in 1087, the succession was unclear, and he was named heir presumptive, but only became heir after his brother's death in 1088.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Robert becomes heir in 1066.\n- Row 1: Succession unclear from 1077-1087; Robert is heir presumptive.\n- Row 2: Robert becomes heir presumptive in 1087 due to his brother's agreement, and became heir in 1088?\nWait, no, the 'became heir' column for row 2 says 1087. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the table structure again. Each row is a different entry.\n\nRow 0: Robert Curthose, became heir 1066.\n\nRow 1: succession unclear 1077-1087; same person?\n\nNo, perhaps not. Let me clarify: each row represents a separate event. So Row 0 is about Robert in 1066.\n\nRow 1 is about the period of succession uncertainty from 1077 to 1087, with Robert as heir presumptive.\n\nThen Row 2 is another entry about Robert becoming heir presumptive in 1087 due to his brother's death, and became heir in 1087? Or does it say he became heir in 1088?\n\nWait, the table's first column says \"Became Heir (Year)\" So for Row 0: 1066.\n\nRow 1: succession unclear 1077-1087; perhaps not a separate becoming, just indicating uncertainty.\n\nRow 2: Robert became heir presumptive in 1087 due to his brother's death, and became heir in 1088? Or is the 'became heir' year 1087?\n\nWait, looking at the data:\n\n| Event Type | Person          | Became Heir (Year) | Ceased Heir (Year) |\n|------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Accession  | Robert Curthose | 1066               | 1088               |\n| Accession  | Henry Beauclerc  | 1103               | ...                |\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the initial data:\n\n- It's a table with three columns: Event Type, Person, Became Heir (Year), and Ceased Heir (Year).\n\nRow 0:\n- Event Type: Accession\n- Person: Robert Curthose\n- Became Heir: 1066\n- Ceased Heir: 1088\n\nWait, so Row 0 says Robert became heir in 1066 and ceased in 1088.\n\nThen Row 1:\n- Event Type: Succession Uncertainty\n- Period: 1077-1087\n- Person: Robert Curthose\n\nNo other columns filled? Or perhaps it's a note that during this time, succession was uncertain with Robert as heir presumptive.\n\nRow 2:\n- Event Type: Accession\n- Person: Robert Curthose\n- Became Heir: 1087\n- Ceased Heir: 1088\n\nWait, so Row 0 and Row 2 both pertain to Robert? That can't be. Maybe the table is structured differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is a different event, not necessarily all about Robert.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nThe task is: Determine if Robert Curthose was declared heir twice, in 1082 and 1094, based on the provided data.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- First entry: Accession of Robert Curthose in 1066; he became heir in that year.\n- Second entry: Succession uncertainty from 1077 to 1087; during this time, Robert was heir presumptive but not yet declared heir again.\n- Third entry: Accession of Henry Beauclerc in 1103.\n\nWait, perhaps the second entry indicates that between 1077 and 1087, succession was uncertain with Robert as heir presumptive, meaning he was the likely successor during that period, but wasn't formally made heir again until after his brother's death in 1088.\n\nSo, in Row 2: Accession of Robert Curthose, became heir in 1087, ceased in 1088. So this would mean he was declared heir again in 1087, making it the second time.\n\nThus, Robert was heir twice: 1066 and 1087. The claim is about him being heir in 1082 and 1094, which doesn't align with the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the claim is incorrect because Robert Curthose was only declared heir twice, but not in those specific years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Robert Curthose was declared heir twice, specifically in 1082 and 1094, is **incorrect**. According to the provided data:\n\n1. **1066**: Robert became heir for the first time.\n2. **1087**: He was declared heir presumptive again after his brother's death and formally became heir later that year, ceasing in 1088.\n\nThere is no record of him being named heir in either 1082 or 1094. Thus, the claim does not align with the historical data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect; Robert Curthose was declared heir twice but not in the years specified.",
