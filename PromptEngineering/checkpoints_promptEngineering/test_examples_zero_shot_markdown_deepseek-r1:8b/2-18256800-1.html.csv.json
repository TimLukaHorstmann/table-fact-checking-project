    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the title of deacon of ss cosma e damiano go to the spanish order of the cardinal - deacon.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant parts of the table. The columns in the table are elector, nationality, order, title, elevated, and elevator. The claim mentions two specific things: the title \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano\" and the \"spanish order\" under \"cardinal - deacon.\"\n\nI'll start by finding rows where the title is \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano.\" Looking at the table, I see that in row 8 (row_index: 8), the title matches exactly. The elector is gil torres, nationality is spanish, order is cardinal - deacon.\n\nNext, I check if this particular row has the nationality as \"spanish\" because the claim mentions the Spanish order. Yes, for row 8, nationality is listed as \"spanish.\"\n\nSo, in this row (row_index:8), both conditions are satisfied: the title matches and the nationality is Spanish. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate.\n\nI don't see any other rows that have this specific combination of title and nationality, so I can focus on row 8 alone for verification.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant row in the table where the title is \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano\" and the nationality is Spanish.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"cardinal - deacon have the title of deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: elector, nationality, order, title, elevated, and elevator. The claim is specifically about \"cardinal - deacon\" individuals having a certain title, so I should focus on the rows where the order is \"cardinal - deacon.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. rinaldo conti de segni: Order is cardinal - bishop, not relevant.\n2. romano bonaventura: Cardinal - bishop as well.\n3. goffredo da castiglione: Cardinal - bishop.\n4. tommaso da capua: Cardinal - priest.\n5. stefano de normandis dei conti: Cardinal - priest.\n6. giovanni colonna: Cardinal - priest.\n7. sinibaldo fieschi: Cardinal - priest.\n8. rainiero capocci , ocist: Cardinal - deacon. This is relevant because the order matches part of the claim.\n9. gil torres: Cardinal - deacon, also relevant.\n10. riccardo annibaldi: Cardinal - deacon, another relevant row.\n11. robert somercotes: Cardinal - deacon, and this one too.\n\nNow, focusing on these rows (8, 9, 10, 11), I need to check their titles. The claim states that they have the title of \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" \n\nLooking at each:\n\n- Rainiero capocci's title is \"deacon of s maria in cosmedin.\"\n- Gil torres: \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano.\"\n- Riccardo annibaldi: \"deacon of s angelo in pescheria.\"\n- Robert somercotes: \"deacon of s eustachio.\"\n\nNone of these titles include \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" Sinibaldo fieschi, who is a cardinal-priest, has the title \"title of s lorenzo in lucina,\" but since his order isn't deacon, he doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, there are no cardinal-deacons in the table with the specified title. The claim seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, I analyzed each relevant row for the \"cardinal - deacon\" category and checked their titles. None of them have the title \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
