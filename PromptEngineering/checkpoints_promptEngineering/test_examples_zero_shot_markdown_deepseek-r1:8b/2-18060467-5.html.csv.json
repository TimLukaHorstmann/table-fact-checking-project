    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"only 1 player be from england and he be david tap.\"\n\nLooking at the 'country' column in the table, I see that there's a row where the country is England. Let me find that row. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Northern Ireland\n- Row 1: United States\n- Row 2: Sweden\n- Row 3: United States\n- Row 4: England\n\nWait, no, looking again, row indices start from 0. So row 0 is darren clarke from Northern Ireland. Let me list each row's country properly:\n\n| place | player          | country       | ... |\n|------|-----------------|--------------|\n| 1    | darren clarke  | northern ireland|\n| 2    | justin leonard  | united states|\n| 3    | jesper parnevik | sweden        |\n| t4   | fred couples    | united states|\n| t4   | david tapping    | england       |\n| t6   | jim furyk       | united states|\n| t6   | tom kite        | united states|\n| 8    | angel cabrera   | argentina     |\n| t9   | mark calcavecchia| united states|\n| t9   | jay haas        | united states|\n| t9   | davis love iii  | united states|\n| t9   | tom watson      | united states|\n\nSo, the player from England is david tapping in row 4 (row_index=4). Now, let's check if there are any other players from England. The rest of the rows don't list England except for row 4. So only one player is from England.\n\nNow, the claim says \"only 1 player be from england and he be david tap.\" Wait, 'tap' seems like a typo. In the table, it's \"david tapping.\" So the correct name is David Tapping.\n\nSo, the first part of the claim is correct: only one player is from England, which is David Tapping.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other players from England. Scanning again: no, only row 4 has 'england' as country. So that condition is met.\n\nThe second part says \"he be david tap.\" But in the table, it's spelled 'david tapping.' So the claim might have a typo here. Does this affect the truthfulness?\n\nHmm, the claim says \"david tap,\" but the actual name is \"david tapping.\" That seems like an error in the claim. However, perhaps the claim intended \"tapping\" as part of his last name and just made a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to David Tap, which isn't present. But in the table, there's no player named David Tap; only David Tapping. So if the claim is looking for someone named David Tap, that doesn't exist, making the claim false.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"he be david tap.\" If he refers to David Tapping, then it's incorrect because his last name is 'tapping,' not 'tap.' Alternatively, if 'tap' is a misprint and they meant 'tapping,' then perhaps it's correct. But as written, it's different.\n\nSo the claim has two parts: only one player from England (correct) and that he is David Tap (incorrectly spelled). Since the second part is incorrect, the overall claim would be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"he be david tap,\" but in the table, it's 'david tapping.' So unless the claim allows for a typo, which it doesn't specify, then it's a mismatch, making the entire claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct because David Tapping is indeed from England, and regardless of the spelling, he is the one player. But I think the key is that 'tap' vs 'tapping' is significant. If the claim says \"david tap,\" but the actual name is \"david tapping,\" then it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's a discrepancy in the player's name.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states only one player from England, which is correct, but incorrectly names him as \"David Tap\" instead of \"David Tapping.\" This discrepancy makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"fred couple and david tapping be both on the t4 place\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: it's in markdown format with columns like place, player, country, score, and to par. The rows have numbers and some have 't' before them, like t4, t6, etc., which probably stands for tied positions.\n\nNow, the claim mentions two players: Fred Couple and David Tapping. I should check if both are on the t4 place.\n\nLooking at the table, the place column has values like 1, 2, 3, t4, t6, etc. So, t4 is a tied position. Let's go through each row to find these two players.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 1: Darren Clarke, not relevant.\n- Row 2: Justin Leonard, nope.\n- Row 3: Jesper Parnevik, nope.\n- Row 4 (t4): Fred Couples is here. His country is United States and his score is 69 + 68 = 137. So Fred Couple is indeed on t4.\n\nNext, looking for David Tapping:\n\nRow 5 is t4 and the player is David Tapping. His country is England with a score of 71 + 66 = 137. So he's also on t4.\n\nSo both Fred Couple and David Tapping are tied at t4, which matches the claim.\n\nWait, but in the table, row 5 shows \"david tapping\" as being at t4, not \"tapping.\" Let me double-check that spelling because sometimes names can be tricky. But according to the table, it's written as \"david tapping,\" so that should be correct.\n\nTherefore, both players are listed on the same tied position of t4. The claim is stating they're both there, which is accurate based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by checking the relevant cells in the table where Fred Couples and David Tapping are both listed at t4 place.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Jesper Parnevik be from Sweden while Justin Leonard be from the US.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see where in the table the relevant information is. Let's break it down into two parts.\n\nStarting with Jesper Parnevik. I remember he's one of the players listed in the table. So I'll search for his name. Scanning through the \"player\" column, I see row 3 has \"jesper parnevik\" from Sweden. That matches the first part of the claim, so that's correct.\n\nNow, Justin Leonard. His name should be next. Looking at the players again, in row 2, it says \"justin leonard\" from the United States. So that checks out too. \n\nWait a minute, I notice something. The table uses abbreviations for country names sometimes, like \"united states\" and \"england,\" so I should make sure they're correct. For Justin Leonard, it's indeed the US, which matches the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. There's no contradiction or missing information here.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the only player with the lowest total score of 133 be darren clarke.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify the relevant columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. Since the claim is about the lowest total score, I'm focusing on the \"score\" column.\n\nLooking through the scores:\n\n- Darren Clarke has a score of 67 + 66 = 133.\n- No other players have a score lower than this in the table. Let's check each player one by one to make sure.\n\nJustin Leonard: 69 + 66 = 135\nJesper Parnevik: 70 + 66 = 136\nFred Couples: 69 + 68 = 137\nDavid Tapping: 71 + 66 = 137\nJim Furyk: 67 + 72 = 139\nTom Kite: 72 + 67 = 139\nAngel Cabrera: 70 + 70 = 140\nMark Calcavecchia: 74 + 67 = 141\nJay Haas: 71 + 70 = 141\nDavis Love III: 70 + 71 = 141\nTom Watson: 71 + 70 = 141\n\nSo, Darren Clarke is the only player with a score of 133. The claim says \"the only player,\" so that seems to be true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key information here is in the \"player\" column for Darren Clarke and the \"score\" column showing his total score of 133.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0 (since it's the first row), columns: player and score.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I'll check if Darren Clarke is the sole player with a score of 133.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"4 players from the US have a to par of -1.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the columns in the table. The relevant columns for the claim are \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"to par.\" Because the claim is about players from the US who have a specific \"to par\" score, I need to filter the rows based on both criteria: country being the United States and \"to par\" being -1.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Row 1:** Darren Clarke, Northern Ireland, -9 \u2192 Not from the US.\n2. **Row 2:** Justin Leonard, United States, -7 \u2192 To par is not -1.\n3. **Row 3:** Jesper Parnevik, Sweden, -6 \u2192 Not from the US.\n4. **t4 Fred Couples:** US, -5 \u2192 Not -1.\n5. **t4 David Tapping:** England, -5 \u2192 Not from the US.\n6. **t6 Jim Furyk:** US, -3 \u2192 Not -1.\n7. **t6 Tom Kite:** US, -3 \u2192 Not -1.\n8. **Row 8:** Angel Cabrera, Argentina, -2 \u2192 Not from the US.\n9. **t9 Mark Calcavecchia:** US, -1 \u2192 This is a player from the US with to par -1.\n10. **t9 Jay Haas:** US, -1 \u2192 Another player from the US with to par -1.\n11. **t9 Davis Love III:** US, -1 \u2192 Third player from the US with to par -1.\n12. **t9 Tom Watson:** US, -1 \u2192 Fourth player from the US with to par -1.\n\nSo, I found four players who are from the US and have a \"to par\" of -1: Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, and Tom Watson. That's four players as mentioned in the claim. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other rows that fit both conditions. Going through each row again:\n\n- Only the t9 group has a \"to par\" of -1.\n- Within that group, all four are from the US.\n\nYes, so four players meet both criteria: country is US and to par is -1. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to list the relevant cells. The relevant columns are \"player,\" \"country,\" and \"to par.\" But actually, since we're focusing on two specific values, I should consider which rows have those values. However, according to the instructions, for each cell that is relevant to verify the claim, I should include their row index and column name.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the relevant cells are not just the \"player\" or \"country\" columns; they're the specific data points (players) that meet both conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider each occurrence where a player is from the US and has a to par of -1 as a cell.\n\nLooking back, each of those four players is in row 9 (t9). So their row indices are 8 (since t9 is row 9, but I think the table starts at row 0. Wait, let me check the original table's markdown: it uses | place | player ... | to par |. The first data row is row 1 in the table, not 0.\n\nWait, no. In the markdown table, the header is row 0, then the data rows start from index 1 onwards. So:\n\n- Row 1: Darren Clarke...\n- Row 2: Justin Leonard...\n- ...\n- Row 8: Angel Cabrera...\n- Rows t9: Mark Calcavecchia...\n\nWait, but in the table, \"t4\" and other positions are listed as row indices. So row 1 is Darren Clarke, up to row 12 (since there are 12 data rows). But some rows have place values like t4, t6, t9.\n\nSo for each of those t9 players, their row indices are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12? Or does \"t9\" correspond to a single row? Let me clarify the table structure. The markdown table shows that the first data row is placed at position 1, so:\n\n- Row 1: Darren Clarke\n- Row 2: Justin Leonard\n...\n- t4 Fred Couples is in row 4?\nNo, wait, looking back, the table's markdown uses | place | player ... and places like t4 are listed as \"t4\". So the first data row after headers is position 1 (place=1), then 2, up to t9 being position 12. Because there are 12 rows in total.\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\n- Header: 0\n- Then 1, 2, 3, t4, t4, t6, t6, 8, t9 (x4), so that's 12 data rows. So row indices go from 1 to 12.\n\nSo the four players in \"t9\" are at rows 8, 9, 10, and 11? Or is it a single row with multiple entries?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 8: Angel Cabrera\n- Then t9 Mark Calcavecchia (row 9)\n- t9 Jay Haas (row 10)\n- t9 Davis Love III (row 11)\n- t9 Tom Watson (row 12)\n\nWait, no. In the markdown table, after row 8 comes t9, but in the table provided, I think it's:\n\nRows 1-3: numbered.\nt4 is position 4\nAnother t4 at position 5?\nWait, let me see the actual table:\n\n| place   | player            | country          | score         | to par   |\n|:--------|:------------------|:-----------------|:--------------|:---------|\n| 1       | darren clarke     | northern ireland | 67 + 66 = 133 | - 9      |\n| 2       | justin leonard    | united states    | 69 + 66 = 135 | - 7      |\n| 3       | jesper parnevik   | sweden           | 70 + 66 = 136 | - 6      |\n| t4      | fred couples      | united states    | 69 + 68 = 137 | - 5      |\n| t4      | david tapping     | england          | 71 + 66 = 137 | - 5      |\n| t6      | jim furyk         | united states    | 67 + 72 = 139 | - 3      |\n| t6      | tom kite          | united states    | 72 + 67 = 139 | - 3      |\n| 8       | angel cabrera     | united states    | ...           | ...      |\n| t9      | mark calcavecchia | united states    | ...           | -1       |\n| t9      | jay haas          | united states    | ...           | -1       |\n| t9      | davis love iii    | united states    | ...           | -1       |\n| t9      | tom watson        | united states    | ...           | -1       |\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the original markdown:\n\nAfter row 3 ( jesper parnevik ), comes:\n\nt4 fred couples\nt4 david tapping\nt6 jim furyk\nt6 tom kite\n8 angel cabrera\nt9 mark calcavecchia\nt9 jay haas\nt9 davis love iii\nt9 tom watson\n\nSo in terms of row indices, starting from 1:\n\nRow 1: Darren...\nRow 2: Justin...\nRow3: Jesper...\nRow4 (t4): Fred...\nRow5 (t4): David...\nRow6 (t6): Jim...\nRow7 (t6): Tom...\nRow8: Angel...\nRow9 (t9): Mark...\nRow10 (t9): Jay...\nRow11 (t9): Davis...\nRow12 (t9): Tom...\n\nYes, so the four t9 players are in rows 9 to 12.\n\nSo their row indices are 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nTherefore, each of these four rows has a player from the US with a to par of -1.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are all the cells in those four rows where \"country\" is united states and \"to par\" is -1.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to identify which specific data points (players) meet the criteria. But for each player that meets the condition, we should include their row index and the columns that are relevant: since the claim concerns country and to par, those are the relevant columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the cells are all the cells in the \"player\" column where country is US and to par is -1. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nHowever, considering the example from the user, they said that for each data point relevant to verify the claim, we should include the row index and the column name.\n\nIn this case, the four players meet both conditions: country = US and to par = -1.\n\nEach of these is in a specific row (9,10,11,12) and their columns are \"player\".\n\nSo the relevant cells would be each player's cell, but perhaps considering their entire row or just the specific columns?\n\nI think since we're focusing on two attributes: country and to par, the relevant columns for verification are \"country\" and \"to par\". Therefore, all four players have in their respective rows: country=US and to par=-1. So each of these rows (9-12) has a cell in the \"country\" column with value US and a cell in \"to par\" with -1.\n\nTherefore, for each row 9-12, we can include both columns as relevant.\n\nBut the instructions say: for each data point that is relevant to verify the claim, list their row index and the column name(s). So perhaps for each occurrence where country=US and to par=-1, we should mark their cells. But since these are multiple rows, each having such a cell, it's better to include all.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps just identify that in rows 9-12, the \"country\" is US and \"to par\" is -1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the player column is relevant because the claim is about players (as opposed to country or to par). Hmm, but no, the claim is about two attributes: being from the US and having a to par of -1.\n\nSo perhaps for each player meeting both conditions, we should include their row index and their \"player\" column name. But since multiple players meet it, we need to list all relevant cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just note that in rows 9-12, the country is US and to par is -1.\n\nBut I think the user expects for each data point (row) where both conditions are met, list the row index and columns. So:\n\nFor row 9: player=Mark Calcavecchia, country=US, to par=-1 \u2192 relevant cells: \"player\" (column), \"country\" (column), \"to par\" (column).\n\nSimilarly for rows 10-12.\n\nBut that seems repetitive since each row contributes multiple cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only list the specific data points (players) as the relevant ones. So their column is \"player\", and they are in rows 9-12.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, identify all players where country=US and to par=-1.\n\nThey are Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, Tom Watson.\n\nEach of these players is located in row 9,10,11,12 respectively.\n\nSo for each player, the relevant cell is their \"player\" column. Since they're all in different rows, perhaps listing their row indices and column names.\n\nBut the columns are different per row? No, columns are consistent: player, country, to par.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Mark Calcavecchia (row9): columns \"player\", \"country\", \"to par\".\n- Similarly for each of the others.\n\nBut that would mean listing four rows, each with three columns. That's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, since all these players have country=US and to par=-1, perhaps just note that in rows 9-12, the \"country\" column is US and \"to par\" is -1.\n\nBut I think the user expects specific cells, not entire rows.\n\nTherefore, for each player meeting the condition (Mark C., Jay H., Davis L., Tom W.), we can list their row index and note that in those rows, the \"player\", \"country\", and \"to par\" columns are relevant.\n\nSo:\n\n- Mark Calcavecchia: row9, columns \"player\", \"country\", \"to par\".\n- Jay Haas: row10, same.\n- Davis Love III: row11, same.\n- Tom Watson: row12, same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just list the players and their row indices as relevant cells in \"player\" column. But I think that's not enough since country and to par are also part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, probably better to include all three columns for each player.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\n- Row9: Mark Calcavecchia; columns: player, country, to par.\n- Row10: Jay Haas; same.\n- Row11: Davis Love III; same.\n- Row12: Tom Watson; same.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are all these instances where in rows 9-12, the \"country\" is US and \"to par\" is -1.\n\nI think this makes sense. So the answer would be to list each of these four players with their respective row indices and note that their columns are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant data points are the players Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, and Tom Watson. Each of these players is in a separate row (9-12) where their country is listed as the United States and their to par score is -1. Therefore, the specific cells that meet the criteria are:\n\n- **Mark Calcavecchia** (Row 9): Columns \"player\", \"country\", \"to par\".\n- **Jay Haas** (Row 10): Columns \"player\", \"country\", \"to par\".\n- **Davis Love III** (Row 11): Columns \"player\", \"country\", \"to par\".\n- **Tom Watson** (Row 12): Columns \"player\", \"country\", \"to par\".\n\nThese cells are the specific data points that verify the claim.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, and Tom Watson}}$",

Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that David Tapping is only one of multiple players from England. So I need to verify if there are other English players in the table besides David Tapping.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row has a column for \"country.\" The player named David Tapping is listed in row 4 with country England. So that's one player from England.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any other players have their country as England. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 1: Darren Clarke from Northern Ireland.\n- Row 2: Justin Leonard from the United States.\n- Row 3: Jesper Parnevik from Sweden.\n- Row 4: David Tapping from England.\n- Row t5: Fred Couples from the United States.\n- Row t6: Jim Furyk and Tom Kite, both from the United States.\n- Row 8: Angel Cabrera from Argentina.\n- Rows t9: Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, and Tom Watson, all from the United States.\n\nSo, besides David Tapping, I don't see any other player with country England.

So yes, only David Tapping is listed under England in the country column.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true because he's the sole player from England.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"fred couple and david tapping tie each others score in the second round.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Fred Couples and David Tapping in the table. Scanning through the 'player' column:\n\n- Row 4 (t4) has Fred Couples from the United States.\n- Row 5 (t4) has David Tapping from England.\n\nSo their rows are t4 and t4. Now, I need to check if their scores are the same. The 'score' column for Fred Couples is 69 + 68 = 137. For David Tapping, it's 71 + 66 = 137 as well. \n\nSince both have a score of 137, they do tie each other in terms of their second-round scores. There's no discrepancy here. The 'to par' for both is -5, which means they're tied there too.\n\nLooking at the table structure, columns relevant to this check are 'player', 'score', and possibly 'country' if needed, but in this case, it's about score comparison. So the relevant cells would be Fred Couples' row (t4) under 'score' and David Tapping's row (t4) under 'score'.\n\nI don't see any other players with the same name or similar names that could confuse the matter. Also, there are no other entries for Fred or David in the table that might affect this comparison.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Jesper Parnevik be from Sweden, while Justin Leonard be from Argentina.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately. Starting with Jesper Parnevik, I need to find his row in the table. Scanning through the players: Darren Clarke is first, Justin Leonard second, Jesper Parnevik third. So, he's in row 3.\n\nLooking at the \"country\" column for row 3, it says Sweden. That matches the claim about Jesper being from Sweden. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, checking Justin Leonard. He's in row 2. The country for him is listed as United States. But the claim says he's from Argentina. That doesn't match at all. \n\nSince there's a discrepancy here\u2014Justin Leonard isn't from Argentina\u2014the overall claim isn't true. I'll need to verify which cells are relevant. For Jesper, it's row 3, column \"country.\" For Justin, it's row 2, same column.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because while one part is correct, the other is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "4 player from the us have a to par score of - 5",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this table with various golf players and their scores, and I need to check if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"4 players from the US have a to par score of -5.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are place, player, country, score, and to par. My focus is on two specific things: whether the player is from the US and if their to par score is -5.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with row 1: Darren Clarke is from Northern Ireland. Not a US player, so I can skip him.\n\nRow 2: Justin Leonard from the US. His to par is -7, which isn't -5, so not relevant for this claim.\n\nRow 3: Jesper Parnevik from Sweden. Also not a US player.\n\nRow t4: Fred Couples is from the US. Let's check his score. The score column says 69 + 68 = 137. To par is -5 because 137 minus 136 (the par) is -1, wait, no. Wait, I think I might be confusing to par with total points. Let me recheck: to par means the player's score is compared to par. Par is typically 70 in many golf tournaments. So if a player's score is 137, subtracting 70 gives 67 over par, which would mean a to par of - (70*2 = 140) so 137 is 3 under par? Wait, no, I think the way it's calculated here is that the total score is 69 + 68 = 137. To find the to par, you subtract from 136 (which is 70 + 66). So 137 - 136 = +1, which would mean the player is one over par, not -5.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the \"to par\" column shows -9 for Darren Clarke. His score was 67 + 66 = 133. Par must be calculated as 70 per round? Wait, no, in two rounds it's usually per round. So maybe the to par is calculated differently here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is showing the total score and then subtracting from some base. For Darren Clarke: 67 + 66 = 133. The \"to par\" is -9. Maybe that means he's nine under par? But how does that happen? Wait, maybe it's a cumulative to par over two rounds. So each round has a par of 70, so after two rounds, the total par would be 140 (70 + 70). His score was 133, which is 7 less than 140, so -7? But the table says -9. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"to par\" is calculated as total score minus the sum of each round's par. So for Darren Clarke: 67 + 66 = 133. Each round's par would be 70 + 70 = 140? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's two rounds, so each round's par is 70, making the total par 140 (70+70). His score is 133, which is 7 below 140, but the table shows -9. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"to par\" is calculated as total score minus twice the par per round. So for Darren Clarke: 67 +66=133. If each round's par is 70, then two rounds would be 140. 133-140 = -7, but the table says -9. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation or the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"to par\" is calculated differently. Maybe it's based on the number of strokes over par per round, summed up and then converted to total to par. For example, Darren Clarke: first round 67 is 3 under (70-67=3), second round 66 is 4 under (70-66=4). So total to par would be -7, but the table says -9. That doesn't add up. Maybe it's something else.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me move on and see if I can figure it out later.\n\nRow t4: David Tapping from England. Not a US player.\n\nRow t6: Jim Furyk is from the US. His score is 67 +72=139. To par? If each round's par is 70, then 139-140=-1, but the table says -3. Hmm, again, not matching my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about players from the US with a to par of -5. So regardless of how the to par is calculated, the key points are:\n\n1. Player is from the US.\n2. Their to par score is -5.\n\nSo perhaps I should focus just on those two aspects without getting bogged down in calculating the exact to par score.\n\nContinuing with the table:\n\nRow t6: Tom Kite is from the US. Let's check his to par. 72 +67=139. Again, if par is 70*2=140, then 139-140=-1. But the table shows -3 for him as well. So I'm not sure how this works.\n\nRow8: Angel Cabrera from Argentina. Not a US player.\n\nRows t9: Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, Tom Watson are all from the US.\n\nLooking at their scores:\n\nMark Calcavecchia: 74 +67=141. If par is 140 (70*2), then 141-140=+1, but table shows -1. So maybe to par is calculated as total score minus 140? But that would mean Mark has +1, not -1.\n\nSimilarly, Jay Haas:71+70=141. 141-140=+1, but table says -1.\n\nDavis Love III:70+71=141. Same as above.\n\nTom Watson:71+70=141. Again, same.\n\nWait, maybe the par is different here. If in each round, it's a par of 66, then two rounds would be 132. So:\n\nDarren Clarke:67+66=133. 133-132=+1 to par, but table says -9. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"to par\" is calculated as strokes below par in each round, summed over both rounds, and represented as a total.\n\nFor Darren Clarke: first round 67 (3 under 70), second round 66 (4 under). Total to par would be -7, but table says -9. Doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the difference from the target score, which is 66+66=132? So:\n\nDarren Clarke:133-132=+1, not -9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, I'm really confused about how the \"to par\" is calculated here. Maybe the table has an error, or it's using a different system. Since I can't figure out the exact calculation, perhaps I should look for players who are from the US and see their to par in the table, regardless of whether my calculation matches.\n\nSo, focusing on that:\n\nPlayers from the US:\n\n- Jim Furyk: score 139, to par -3\n- Tom Kite: score 139, to par -3\n- Mark Calcavecchia: score 141, to par +1 (but table says -1)\n- Jay Haas: score 141, to par +1 (table says -1)\n- Davis Love III: score 141, same\n- Tom Watson: same\n\nSo perhaps the table's \"to par\" is different from my calculation. Maybe it's a misprint or they have a different way of calculating.\n\nBut regardless, I need to see if any US players have a to par of -5 according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nAfter reviewing, the US players are Jim Furyk and Tom Kite with to par -3 each, and the others have +1. So none of them have a to par of -5 as per the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed someone else.\n\nLet me list all the players and their \"to par\":\n\nDarren Clarke: -9\nDavid Tapping: Not US\nTom Kite: -3\nMark Calcavecchia: +1\nJay Haas: +1\nDavis Love III: +1\nTom Watson: +1\n\nSo no, none of the US players have a to par of -5.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be zero.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to identify professional golfers from the United States who achieved a \"to par\" score of -5 in the given table. Upon examining each player:\n\n- **Jim Furyk** and **Tom Kite**: Both scored 139, with their \"to par\" listed as -3.\n- **Mark Calcavecchia**, **Jay Haas**, **Davis Love III**, and **Tom Watson**: Each had a score of 141, with their \"to par\" recorded as +1.\n\nNone of the US-based golfers achieved a \"to par\" of -5. Therefore, there are no players from the United States in the table who meet this criterion.\n\n**Answer:** There are no professional golfers from the United States listed with a \"to par\" score of -5.",
