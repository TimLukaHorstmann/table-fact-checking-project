    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"david frost.\" Looking at the table, I should check if there's a player named David Frost in it. Scanning through the players column: paul azinger, nick faldo, david frost, craig stadler, payne stewart, tom watson, raymond floyd, mark calcavecchia, rodger davis, graham marsh, nick price. Yes, there's an entry for David Frost.\n\nNext part of the claim is \"be from united state.\" So I need to see where David Frost is listed as being from. Looking at the country column: united states, england, south africa, etc. For David Frost, his country is south africa. So he isn't from the United States.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"united state,\" which might be a typo for \"United States.\" Regardless, the key point is that David Frost's country is south africa, not united states. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to find the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. The relevant columns are 'player' and 'country'. For David Frost, row index 2 (since it starts from 0 or 1? Let me check: the first row is 1, then t2, t4, etc. Wait, actually the row indices go from 0 to 9 based on the markdown table. So let's see:\n\nThe table has rows starting with 1, t2, t2, t4, t4, t4, 7, t8, t8, t8, t8. So the indices would be 0: row 1, 1: t2 (nick faldo), 2: t2 (david frost), etc. Wait no, in markdown tables, each row is a separate line. The first data row after headers is place=1, player=paul azinger... that's index 0? Or perhaps the rows are numbered as per their order.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user's example shows \"row_index\" as integers, so I think it refers to the position in the table starting from 0. So the first row after headers is row 0: place=1, player=paul azinger... then next rows are 1,2,3, etc.\n\nWait no, looking at the user's example, their JSON has \"row_index\" as 0 and 1 for Revenue and Employees. So probably, each row in the table corresponds to a row index starting from 0 upwards, regardless of place or t2 or t8. So I need to list which rows have relevant information.\n\nDavid Frost is in the third row (since first row is paul azinger, second is nick faldo). Wait no: the table has:\n\nRow 1: paul azinger\nRow 2: nick faldo\nRow 3: david frost\nRow 4: craig stadler\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, actually, the table starts with place=1 as the first data row. So perhaps the row index is based on their position in the table starting from 0. So:\n\n- Row 0: place 1, paul azinger\n- Row 1: t2, nick faldo\n- Row 2: t2, david frost\n- And so on.\n\nSo for David Frost, his row is index 2 and the columns are 'player' and 'country'.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row_index=2, column_name='player' and 'country'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
