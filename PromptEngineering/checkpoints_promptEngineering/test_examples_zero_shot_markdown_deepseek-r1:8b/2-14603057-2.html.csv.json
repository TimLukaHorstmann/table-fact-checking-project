Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it says that \"plain\" should be in Class A during the 1988-89 and 1989-90 school years. To verify this, I need to check these specific years in the table and see if the entry under \"class a\" is indeed \"plain.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying the rows corresponding to the 1988-89 and 1989-90 school years. Scanning through the table, row index 0 is for 1988-89, and row index 1 is for 1989-90.\n\nNext, I'll look at the \"class a\" column in these rows. For row 0 (1988-89), under \"class a,\" it says \"plains.\" Similarly, for row 1 (1989-90), it also lists \"plains\" in the \"class a\" column.\n\nSo both specified school years have \"plain\" as Class A. There's no discrepancy here; the claim holds true for both years.\n\nI should ensure there are no other factors that might affect this conclusion, but based on the table provided and the specific columns checked, everything aligns with the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class a\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"lindsay be class a and elkhart be class aa during the 2010 - 11 school year.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The table has multiple columns: school year, class a, class aa, etc. Each row represents a different school year from 1988-89 up to 2010-11.\n\nLooking at the claim, there are two specific mentions:\n1. Lindsay should be in Class A.\n2. Elkhart should be in Class AA during the 2010-11 school year.\n\nSo, I need to check the table for the 2010-11 row and see what classes Lindsay and Elkhart fall into.\n\nI'll start by locating the 2010-11 school year in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find that the 2010-11 row has:\n- School Year: 2010 - 11\n- Class A: Lindsay\n- Class AA: Elkhart\n- And so on for other classes.\n\nWait a minute, according to the table for 2010-11, Class A is listed as \"lindsay\" and Class AA is \"elkhart.\" That matches exactly what the claim is stating.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the 1995 - 96 school year class a go to rule and the class aa go to stamford.\" So, for the 1995-96 school year, we're looking at two specific classes: Class A and Class AA. The claim says that in this year, Class A moves to 'rule' and Class AA moves to 'stamford'.\n\nNext, I need to look at the table provided. The table lists various school years from 1988-89 up to 2010-11. Each row corresponds to a school year, and each column represents different classes: a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa.\n\nMy task is to find the relevant cells in the table that correspond to the claim. So, I need to locate the 1995-96 row and check the 'Class A' and 'Class AA' columns for that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row until I find the one labeled \"1995 - 96\". Let's see:\n\n1. 1988-89\n2. 1989-90\n3. 1990-91\n4. 1991-92\n5. 1992-93\n6. 1993-94\n7. 1994-95\n8. 1995-96 \u2013 here we go.\n\nNow, for the \"Class A\" column in this row, what's the value? Let me check: it says 'rule'. So that part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, for \"Class AA\": according to the table, in 1995-96, Class AA is 'stamford'. That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant_cells, I need to note the row index and column names for each relevant cell. The row for 1995-96 is at index 8. So:\n\n- For Class A: row_index 8, column_name 'class a'.\n- For Class AA: row_index 8, column_name 'class aa'.\n\nI should make sure to list these as objects in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"class a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"class aa\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So the claim is: \"plain be name class a for the 2004 - 05 school year.\" I need to check if this statement holds true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's asserting that in the 2004-05 school year, the class A is named \"plain.\" So, my task is to look up the 2004-05 row and see under the \"class a\" column if the entry is \"plain.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school year. The years go from 1988-89 up to 2010-11. I need to locate the row for 2004-05. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- 1999-2000: valley view, hamilton, bridgeport...\n- 2000-01: nazareth, elkhart...\n- 2001-02: nazareth, elkhart...\n- 2002-03: plains, argyle...\n- 2003-04: henrietta midway, argyle...\n- 2004-05: garden city, salado...\n\nWait, that's the row for 2004-05. Now, under \"class a,\" what is listed? Let me check. The columns are:\n\nschool year | class a | class aa | class aaa | ... etc.\n\nSo in 2004-05, class a is \"garden city.\" Hmm, that doesn't match the claim which says it should be \"plain.\"\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through each row carefully to find 2004-05. The first few rows after 2000:\n\n1999-2000: valley view, hamilton...\n2000-01: nazareth...\n2001-02: nazareth...\n2002-03: plains...\n2003-04: henrietta midway...\n2004-05: garden city...\n\nYes, that's correct. So for 2004-05, class a is \"garden city,\" not \"plain.\" Therefore, the claim is false because it states that class a is named \"plain\" in that year, which isn't the case.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Maybe I confused rows or columns. Let me see if there's another instance where class a is \"plain.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- 1988-89: plains\n- 2002-03: plains\n- 2004-05: garden city\n\nWait, in 2002-03, class a is \"plains,\" but that's two years before 2004-05. So for 2004-05, it's definitely garden city.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because in the 2004-05 school year, class a isn't named \"plain\" but rather \"garden city.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"class a\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the name of the class aa be stamford with class a of westbrook and school year of 1995 - 96.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part means.

Each row represents a different school year from 1988-89 up to 2010-11.\n\nTo verify each part:\n1. **Class AA is Stamford**: I need to find any rows where Class AA column is \"Stamford.\" Let me scan the table. Looking at the 'class aa' column:\n\n- 1988-89: shallowater\n- 1989-90: shallowater\n- 1990-91: shallowater\n- 1991-92: Stamford\n- 1992-93: Quanah\n- 1993-94: Stamford\n- 1994-95: Bridgeport\n- 1995-96: Stamford (Yes, I see it here)\n- 1996-97: Plains\n- 1997-98: Santa Rosa\n- ... and so on.\n\nSo for school year 1995-96, class aa is Stamford. That's one part correct.\n\n2. **Class A is Westbrook**: Now check the 'class a' column for any row where it says \"Westbrook.\" Let's see:\n\nLooking at 'class a':\n- 1988-89: Plains\n- 1989-90: Plains\n- 1990-91: Sterling City\n- 1991-92: San Isidro\n- 1992-93: Westbrook (Yes, here)\n- 1993-94: Rule\n- 1994-95: Rule\n- 1995-96: Rule\n- 1996-97: Plains\n- 1997-98: Plains\n- ... continues.\n\nWait, for school year 1992-93, class a is Westbrook.

The claim is: \"session 1992 - 93 be the school year with class aaa of mcallen and class aaaa of longview pine tree.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: school year, class a, class aa, class aaa, class aaaa, and class aaaaa. Each row corresponds to a different school year from 1988-89 up to 2010-11.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific classes in the 1992-93 school year: class aaa for Mcallen and class aaaa for Longview Pine Tree. So I need to check if in that particular school year, those two classes exist as per the table.\n\nLooking at the 1992-93 row:\n\n- School year: 1992 - 93\n- Class a: quanah\n- Class aa: shallowater\n- Class aaa: carrizo springs\n- Class aaaa: longview pine tree\n- Class aaaaa: mcallen\n\nSo for the class aaa, it's Carrizo Springs, not Mcallen. And for class aaaa, it's Longview Pine Tree.\n\nWait, but the claim says that in 1992-93, the class aaa is Mcallen and class aaaa is Longview Pine Tree. From the table, in 1992-93, class aaa is Carrizo Springs, not Mcallen, and class aaaa is indeed Longview Pine Tree. So there's a mismatch for class aaa.\n\nBut I need to check if both conditions are met simultaneously. The claim states that both class aaa is Mcallen AND class aaaa is Longview Pine Tree in 1992-93. \n\nLooking at the table, in 1992-93:\n\n- Class aaa: Carrizo Springs\n- Class aaaa: Longview Pine Tree\n\nSo the class aaaa part is correct, but class aaa is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is making two statements: both that in 1992-93, Mcallen has class aaa and Longview Pine Tree has class aaaa.\n\nSince only one of these two is true (Longview Pine Tree as aaaa), but the other (Mcallen as aaa) is false, the overall claim is FALSE because not both conditions are met. \n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if Mcallen appears in any class for 1992-93. Looking at the row:\n\nClass aaaaa: mcallen.\n\nSo in 1992-93, Mcallen is under class aaaaa, not aaa. Therefore, the claim's assertion that it's in class aaa is incorrect.\n\nHence, the relevant cells would be the ones for 1992-93, specifically class aaa and aaaa columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 1992-93 school year, Mcallen is in class aaa and Longview Pine Tree is in class aaaa. Checking the table:\n\n- **Class aaa** for 1992-93 is Carrizo Springs, not Mcallen.\n- **Class aaaa** for 1992-93 is Longview Pine Tree.\n\nSince only one part of the claim holds true, it's FALSE overall.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"class aaa\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"class aaaa\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that in the year 2004-05 (which I assume corresponds to school year 2004-05), the class \"a\" is named \"garden city.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: school year, class a, class aa, and so on up to class aaaaa. Each row represents a different school year from 1988-89 to 2010-11.\n\nSo my task is to find in the 2004-05 school year, what's listed under \"class a.\" If it's \"garden city,\" then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet me go through each step carefully. \n\nI need to locate the row for the school year 2004-05. Scanning through the table:\n\n- 1988-89\n- 1989-90\n- 1990-91\n- 1991-92\n- 1992-93\n- 1993-94\n- 1994-95\n- 1995-96\n- 1996-97\n- 1997-98\n- 1998-99\n- 1999-2000\n- 2000-01\n- 2001-02\n- 2002-03\n- 2003-04\n- 2004-05 (found it)\n\nNow, in the 2004-05 row, under \"class a,\" what's the value? Looking at that column: class a for 2004-05 is \"garden city.\" So that matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the exact wording. The claim says \"garden city be the name of the class a with school session 2004 - 05.\" Yes, that's exactly what's in the table. \n\nSo there are no discrepancies here. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should also note down which cells are relevant to verify this. Each row has a \"row_index\" based on its position starting from 0.

The claim says: \"pharr - san juan - alamo be the class aaaa of school session 2001 - 02\".\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The term \"class aaaa\" likely corresponds to a specific column in the table. Looking at the table headers, it seems that each row represents a school year, and each column is labeled as class a, aa, aaa, aaaa, etc., up to class aaaaa.\n\nSo, I need to find two things: \n1. Which row corresponds to the school session 2001 - 02.\n2. In that row, what is listed under \"class aaaa\".\n\nStarting with identifying the relevant row. The table's first column is \"school year,\" which lists years in the format like \"1988 - 89\", which I assume means from 1988 to 1989. So, \"2001 - 02\" would be the row where school_year is \"2001 - 02\".\n\nLooking through the table, I see that the rows go up to 2010 - 11. Scanning down, I find:\n\n- 1997 - 98\n- 1998 - 99\n- 1999 - 2000\n- 2000 - 01\n- 2001 - 02\n\nYes, row_index 13 (if we start counting from 0) corresponds to \"2001 - 02\".\n\nNow, in that row, I need to check the \"class aaaa\" column. Looking at each row's structure: The columns are class a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa.\n\nFor example, looking at the first row: 1988-89 has \"port neches - groves\" under aaaa. So, for 2001 - 02, I need to find what's under \"class aaaa\".\n\nLooking at the relevant row:\n\n| 2001 - 02 | nazareth         | elkhart      | bridgeport      | longview pine tree        | san antonio southwest    |\n\nHere, the columns are:\n- class a: nazareth\n- class aa: elkhart\n- class aaa: bridgeport\n- class aaaa: longview pine tree\n- class aaaaa: san antonio southwest\n\nSo, \"class aaaa\" is listed as \"longview pine tree\". The claim states that it should be \"pharr - san juan - alamo\".\n\nComparing these two, they are different. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the table.\n\nI need to make sure I'm checking the correct columns and rows. Sometimes, the column headers might have a naming inconsistency, but looking at the markdown, it's clear that \"class aaaa\" is the fourth column in each row. So my previous conclusion holds.\n\nTherefore, since the value for class aaaa in 2001-02 is \"longview pine tree\", not \"pharr - san juan - alamo\", the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are identified by their row index and the corresponding column name where \"class aaaa\" should match.

No.\n\n1994-95: rule, stamford, bridgeport, gregory-portland, sugar land elkins. Not relevant here because the claim is about Lindsay, not these.\n\n1995-96: same as above. No.\n\n1996-97: henrietta midway, plains, bridgeport, longview pine tree, pharr-san juan-alamo. Still no Lindsay in aa class.\n\n1997-98: rule, plains, santa rosa, azle. No.\n\n1998-99: valley view, hamilton, santa rosa, pharr-san juan-alamo. Not relevant.\n\n1999-2000: valley view, hamilton, bridgeport, fredericksburg. No Lindsay here.\n\n2000-01: nazareth, elkhart, bridgeport, pharr-san juan-alamo. No.\n\n2001-02: nazareth, elkhart, bridgeport, longview pine tree. No.\n\n2002-03: plains, elkhart, bridgeport, longview pine tree. Still no Lindsay in aa class.\n\n2003-04: henrietta midway, argyle, bridgeport, pharr-san juan-alamo. No.\n\n2004-05: plains, argyle, bridgeport, longview pine tree. No.\n\n2005-06: garden city, argyle, bridge city, mission veterans memorial. Wait, here's mission veterans memorial as a class aaaaa. But the claim is about aa class with Lindsay.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each row again more carefully.\n\nLooking for \"lindsay\" in class a or class aa columns.\n\nIn 2008-09: lindsay is in class a, and elkhart is class aa. So class a is Lindsay, but the claim says mission veteran memoria is the aa class with Lindsay. Wait, no\u2014the claim is about the aa class being associated with Lindsay, not that Lindsay is in the aa class.\n\nWait, actually, the claim is: \"mission veteran memoria be the aa class with lindsay\". So I think it means that the aa class for a certain school year is mission veteran memorial, and that this is associated with Lindsay. Or maybe that the aa class is linked to Lindsay through some other term.\n\nLooking back at each row, let's check if any of them have \"mission veteran memoria\" in class aa.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- 2000-01: mission veterans memorial appears as a class aaaa? No, looking at the columns, it's under class aaaa. Wait, no, in 2000-01, class a is nazareth, class aa is elkhart, class aaa is bridgeport, class aaaa is mission veterans memorial, and class aaaaa is pharr-san juan-alamo.\n\nWait, so in row 2000-01, the class aaaa is mission veterans memorial. But the claim is about the aa class being associated with Lindsay. So mission veteran memoria is in the aaaa column here, but not in aa.\n\nLooking for \"lindsay\" in class a or aa columns:\n\nIn 2008-09: lindsay is class a, and elkhart is class aa.\n\nIn 2010-11: lindsay is class a again, with elkhart as class aa. So the claim would be that mission veteran memoria is the aa class (elkhart) associated with Lindsay (in class a). But in this case, mission veterans memorial is not the aa class; it's in the aaaa column.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"mission veteran memoria be the aa class with lindsay\". So perhaps mission veteran memory is the aa class and it's associated with Lindsay in another column?\n\nLooking at 2010-11: mission veterans memorial is under aaaa, not aa. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIs there any row where mission veteran memory is in the aa column? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all rows, I don't see \"mission veteran memory\" in class aa. It's only in aaaa or aaaaa columns.\n\nTherefore, it seems like the claim is incorrect because mission veterans memorial isn't an aa class but an aaaa class. So the statement that \"mission veteran memoria be the aa class with lindsay\" is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because \"mission veteran memory\" appears under the aaaa column and not the aa column, thus it cannot be considered as the aa class associated with Lindsay.\n\nAnswer: False",
