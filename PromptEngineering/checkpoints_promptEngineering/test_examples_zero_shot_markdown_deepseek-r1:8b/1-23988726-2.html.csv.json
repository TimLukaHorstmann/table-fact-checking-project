That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in other rows that would negate this specific claim.

    "claim": "the asian record be set on september 3rd 2004",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the asian record be set on september 3rd 2004\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. There are several columns: world record, championship record, and so on. Each row seems to represent a different type of record with specific details like the athlete's name, their time, location, and date.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"asian record\" being set on September 3rd, 2004. So, I should focus on the rows that mention the Asian record. Looking at the table, there's one row labeled \"asian record.\" \n\nIn that row, the athlete is Saif Saeed Shaheen from Qatar, with a time of 7:53.63, location Brussels, Belgium, and date September 3rd, 2004. This seems to directly match the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there aren't any other relevant rows that might contradict or support this. For example, there's also a \"world record\" for the same athlete on the same date in Brussels. But the claim is about the Asian record specifically, so that row isn't directly related unless there's confusion.\n\nSo, focusing solely on the \"asian record\" row, all the details align with the claim: September 3rd, 2004 in Brussels. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be those under the Asian Record row. Specifically, the \"row_index\" and the \"column_name.\" Looking at the table structure, each row's index starts from 0. So, the Asian Record row is the fifth one (index 4) because the first four rows are World record, Championship, etc. The columns involved would be world record, asian record, date, and location.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the table has seven rows, each with their own type of record. So, the Asian Record row is the fifth one (index 4), and the relevant columns are \"asian record,\" which includes athlete, time, location, and date.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index: 4\n- column_name: asian record\nAnd also, perhaps the specific columns within that row, like athlete, time, etc., but according to the instructions, it's about the cells related to verifying the claim. So, maybe each data point in the Asian Record row is relevant.\n\nWait, no, the instruction says \"a list of objects, each with 'row_index' (int) and 'column_name' (string).\" So for each relevant cell, we need to specify which row it's in and the column name.\n\nIn this case, the claim refers to the Asian Record being set on a specific date. The relevant information is in the \"asian record\" column, so I should list that as a relevant cell. Additionally, the date (3 september 2004) is in the \"date\" column of that row, and the location (brussels, belgium) is in the \"location\" column.\n\nWait, but the claim only mentions the date, not the location or athlete. Hmm, but to verify the claim, we need to check if the Asian Record was indeed set on September 3rd, 2004. So, all cells in that row are relevant because they contain data about the record.\n\nBut perhaps the most directly relevant is the \"date\" column since the claim refers specifically to September 3rd, 2004. However, the instructions say to include a list of all relevant cells for verification, so I should include all columns from that row: world leading might not be relevant, but in this case, it's the Asian Record row.\n\nWait no, the Asian Record row is separate. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the table again, each row represents a different record type. The fifth row (index 4) is the \"asian record\" row. So, all the columns under that row are relevant to verify the claim about when the Asian Record was set.\n\nSo, the cells in that row include:\n- saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\n- 7:53.63\n- brussels , belgium\n- 3 september 2004\n\nEach of these columns is part of that specific record's data, so they are all relevant to verifying the claim.\n\nBut wait, the claim doesn't mention anything about the athlete or the time, only the date. However, to fully verify that the Asian Record was set on September 3rd, we need to check that it indeed occurred on that date, which is in the \"date\" column. So perhaps just the date is directly relevant.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should list all cells that are relevant for verifying the claim. Since the claim states that the Asian Record was set on a specific date, the date cell is crucial. The location might also be considered as it's part of the record's details. But perhaps the most direct relevance is the date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all cells in that row are relevant because they contribute to establishing that record. So, including each column from the Asian Record row would make sense.\n\nIn conclusion, I think all columns under the \"asian record\" row are relevant for verifying the claim, as they collectively provide information about when and where the record was set.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table, specifically in the \"asian record\" row. The date matches September 3rd, 2004, confirming the statement.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"asian record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"7:53.63\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"brussels , belgium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"3 september 2004\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by reading through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the world lead record be set by Ezekiel Kemboi with a time of 7:58.85.\" \n\nFirst, I should check the table to see if there's an entry for Ezekiel Kemboi as the world leading record holder and his time. The table has several columns: world record, championship record, etc., but the most relevant column here is \"world leading\" because that's what the claim refers to.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Under \"world leading,\" I see Ezekiel Kemboi with a time of 7:58.85.\n2. The location is Doha, Qatar, and the date is May 8, 2009.\n\nSo the claim matches exactly on two points: the name and the time. Therefore, it's TRUE. Now, I need to map this in terms of row indices and column names as per the instructions.\n\nWait, looking back at the table markdown, each row has a specific entry. The \"world leading\" is one of the columns. So in the table, Ezekiel Kemboi is listed under the \"world leading\" column. Each row is a separate record, so I should find out which row index corresponds to this information.\n\nLet me count the rows:\n\n1. world record\n2. championship record\n3. world leading\n4. african record\n5. asian record\n6. north american record\n7. south american record\n8. european record\n\nWait, no, looking again, each row in the table is a different type of record, but within each row, there are columns: for example, \"world leading\" is one column, with the athlete's name, time, location, and date.\n\nSo each row represents a specific category (like world record, championship, etc.), and each has their own details. The relevant part here is in the row labeled \"world leading,\" which is row index 3 (since we start counting from 0). The columns involved are:\n\n- saif saaeed shaheen (qat) for another row, so not relevant here.\nWait no, the columns in each row are fixed: world record, championship record, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at the table again, each row is a different type of record (world, championship, leading), and under each type, there's an athlete, time, location, date.\n\nSo, for the \"world leading\" row, which is row index 3 (since rows are 0-based: 0-world record, 1-championship, 2-af, etc.)?\n\nWait no, let me count:\n\nRow 0: world record\nRow 1: championship record\nRow 2: african record\nRow 3: asian record\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, the table has the following columns as headers:\n\nworld record, championship record, world leading, african record, asian record, north american record, south american record, european record.\n\nEach of these is a row in the markdown table, so rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0: world record\nRow 1: championship record\nRow 2: world leading\nRow 3: african record\nRow 4: asian record\nRow 5: north american record\nRow 6: south american record\nRow 7: european record\n\nWait, no. In markdown tables, each row is a separate line. So the headers are:\n\n| world record          | saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )   | 7:53.63   | brussels , belgium        | 3 september 2004   |\n...\nSo the first data row corresponds to \"world record\" as the header, then next is championship, etc.\n\nWait no, the headers are all across at the top. Let me re-express the table properly:\n\nHeaders (row 0):\n\n- world record\n- saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\n- 7:53.63\n- brussels , belgium\n- 3 september 2004\n\nThen, each subsequent row is a different type of record, with their own entries.\n\nSo the next header after \"world record\" would be \"championship record,\" and so on down to \"european record.\"\n\nTherefore, in terms of rows:\n\nRow 0: world record (headers)\nRow 1: championship record\nRow 2: world leading\nRow 3: african record\n...\nWait no, that's not correct. The table shows multiple columns per row, but each main category is a separate row.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see the table as having rows where each row represents a different category of records, and within each category, the details are in the sub-columns.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- Row 1: championship record\n- Row 2: world leading\n- etc.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to map it properly.\n\nEach row in the table corresponds to a different type of record, such as \"world record,\" \"championship record,\" etc. Each of these rows has several columns:\n\n1. The main category (e.g., world record)\n2. Athlete's name\n3. Time\n4. Location\n5. Date\n\nSo, for the \"world leading\" row, which is one of the categories, it's in row 2 (since row 0 is world record, row 1 is championship, row 2 is world leading). So row index is 2.\n\nWithin that row, the columns are:\n\n- Athlete: Ezekiel Kemboi\n- Time: 7:58.85\n- Location: Doha, Qatar\n- Date: 8 May 2009\n\nSo the claim states that Ezekiel Kemboi set the world lead record with 7:58.85.\n\nTherefore, in terms of relevant cells:\n\nThe row is index 2 (world leading), and the columns are \"saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\" isn't relevant here; wait no, each row's first column is the main category, like \"world leading.\" So in the table, each row's first column is the main category, followed by athlete, time, location, date.\n\nTherefore, to get Ezekiel Kemboi's world leading record:\n\n- Row index 2 (since row 0: world record, row1: championship, row2: world leading)\n- Columns: the athlete's name (\"ezekiel kemboi ( ken )\") and the time (\"7:58.85\").\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has columns:\n\nFor example, row 2 (world leading) has:\n\n| world leading         | ezekiel kemboi ( ken )        | 7:58.85   | doha , qatar              | 8 may 2009         |\n\nSo the relevant columns are \"saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\" is not relevant here, it's the athlete column for that row, but in this case, it's Ezekiel Kemboi.\n\nWait no, each row has a main category, then the athlete, then time, location, date.\n\nSo for world leading row:\n\n- Main category: world leading\n- Athlete: Ezekiel Kemboi\n- Time: 7:58.85\n- Location: Doha, Qatar\n- Date: 8 May 2009\n\nTherefore, in terms of cells:\n\nThe athlete's name is in column index 1, and time in column index2.\n\nSo the two relevant cells are row index2, columns1 (athlete) and column2 (time).\n\nThus, the claim refers to Ezekiel Kemboi's world leading record, which matches these cells.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 2, column1: ezekiel kemboi ( ken )\n\nRow2, column2:7:58.85\n\nBut wait, in the table as given, each row has five columns beyond the headers?\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nThe first line is the header with columns:\n\n- world record\n- saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\n- 7:53.63\n- brussels , belgium\n- 3 september 2004\n\nThen each data row has similar structure.\n\nSo for example, the second line after headers:\n\n| championship record | someone | time | location | date |\n\nTherefore, in row2 (world leading):\n\nColumns:\n\n1. world leading (main category)\n2. ezekiel kemboi ( ken )\n3. 7:58.85\n4. doha , qatar\n5. 8 may 2009\n\nSo the columns are numbered as:\n\n0: world leading\n\n1: athlete name\n\n2: time\n\n3: location\n\n4: date\n\nWait, but that's inconsistent because in other rows, for example, row0 (world record):\n\nColumns are:\n\n0: world record\n\n1: saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\n\n2:7:53.63\n\n3:brussels , belgium\n\n4:3 september 2004\n\nTherefore, yes, each data row has five columns beyond the main category.\n\nSo to get Ezekiel Kemboi's world leading record, we need:\n\nRow index2 (world leading), column1: athlete name = ezekiel kemboi ( ken )\n\nAnd column2: time =7:58.85\n\nTherefore, in terms of cells, these are two separate cells.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are row2, columns1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering all data rows, including headers, but I think the problem is about cells in the data part, not the header.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider that each main category (world record, championship, etc.) is a separate row, starting from row0 as world record, then row1: championship, and so on.\n\nThus, Ezekiel Kemboi's world leading record is in row2, columns for athlete and time.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row2, column1 and row2, column2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the claim refers to Ezekiel Kemboi setting the world lead with a time of 7:58.85, which corresponds exactly to row2, columns for athlete and time.\n\nTherefore, in terms of cells:\n\n- Row2, column1 (athlete): ezekiel kemboi ( ken )\n\n- Row2, column2 (time):7:58.85\n\nSo the two relevant data cells are these.\n\nHence, the answer is that the relevant cells are row2, columns1 and 2.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells containing the information about Ezekiel Kemboi's world leading record are located in row 2, columns 1 (athlete) and column 2 (time).\n\nAnswer: The relevant data cells are in row 2, columns 1 and 2.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nThe claim is: \"the asian record be make by saif saaeed shaheen in july 14 2006\". So, I have to check each part of this statement against the table provided and see if it matches correctly.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns like 'world record', 'championship record', etc., and rows with different runners from various countries along with their records, locations, and dates.\n\nI'll break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Asian Record**: The claim refers to the Asian record. So I need to find the row in the table that corresponds to this. Looking at the table, there's a row labeled 'asian record' which is in row index 4 (since it starts from 0). The runner for the Asian record is listed as \"saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\", and his time is 7:53.63, held on September 3, 2004, in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n2. **Maker of the Record**: The claim states that Saif Saaeed Shaheen made this record. From the table, under 'asian record', the runner's name is indeed \"saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )\". So this part matches.\n\n3. **Date of the Record**: The claim mentions \"july 14 2006.\" However, in the table, the Asian record was set on September 3, 2004. There's no July date for Saif Saaeed Shaheen's Asian record; he actually holds that record as per the table.\n\nNow, I'll check if there are any other runners named Saif Saaeed Shaheen in different records to see if perhaps another row might have a matching date. Looking through each row:\n\n- The world record is held by someone else (Saif isn't mentioned here).\n- The championship record and African record also don't list him.\n- There's a South American record by Wander Do Prado Moura, but that's unrelated.\n- The European record is Bouabdellah Tahri, not Saif.\n\nWait, there's another row: 'world leading' also lists Saif Saaeed Shaheen with the same time and date as the Asian record. So he holds both Asian and World Leading records on September 3, 2004.\n\nSo, in the claim, it says he made the Asian record on July 14, 2006. But according to the table, that specific Asian record was set in September 2004. There's no evidence of him holding the Asian record on July 14, 2006. In fact, looking at other rows, maybe someone else did a different record on that date? Let me check.\n\nLooking for any runner with Saif Saaeed Shaheen around July 2006: The closest is the North American and South American records, but those are held by Daniel Lincoln and Wander Do Prado Moura. No Asian or other records by him in July 2006.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check each row again. The 'north american record' is Daniel Lincoln with a time of 8:08.82 on July 14, 2006, in Rome, Italy. So that's the date mentioned in the claim, but it's not related to Saif Saaeed Shaheen.\n\nSo, the claim is trying to say Saif made the Asian record on July 14, 2006, which isn't accurate because he actually did it on September 3, 2004. Therefore, the date doesn't match, making the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Saif Saaeed Shaheen set the Asian record on July 14, 2006, whereas according to the table, this occurred on September 3, 2004.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"asian record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. The claim is: \"July 14 2006 be when the European record be made.\" So I need to check if there's a European record in the table with that date.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table and see what information it has. The columns are: world record, championship record, world leading, African record, Asian record, North American record, South American record, and European record. Each row has an athlete's name, their time, location, and date.\n\nI need to focus on the European record column because the claim is about that specific record. So I'll go through each row where the column is \"European record.\"\n\n1. The first row with European record: Bouabdellah Tahri from France, 8:02.19, Metz, France, July 3, 2009.\n2. Next, any others? Let me check all rows again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nLooking through the table, there are only two entries under European record: one in row 0 and another maybe? Wait, no, actually, in the provided table, each row seems to have a different category except for the first row which is world record. Let me re-examine the structure.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that the table has multiple rows with various types like world record, championship, etc. But the specific column \"European record\" only appears once in the data provided, right? So there's only one European record entry.\n\nSo the date for the European record is July 3, 2009, according to the table. The claim states that it was made on July 14, 2006. That doesn't match because July 14, 2006 is earlier than July 3, 2009 and also a different year.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the table, row index 0 has European record with date 3 july 2009. So that's not matching July 14, 2006. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the European record was set later, on July 3, 2009, not July 14, 2006.\n\nSo I need to check if any row has a date of July 14, 2006 under European record. Looking through all rows:\n\n- North American record: Daniel Lincoln on July 14, 2006 in Rome, Italy.\n- Other records have different dates and locations.\n\nNo European record entry matches July 14, 2006. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no European record set on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the European record was made on July 14, 2006. Checking the table, the European record was actually set on July 3, 2009. There's no entry for July 14, 2006 in the European record column.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant cells:** The only relevant cell is row index 0 (European record) because it shows the actual date of the European record, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"European record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
    "true_response": 0,
    "relevant_cells": [
      {
        "row_index": 0,
        "column_name": "European record"
      }
    ]
  }
]
