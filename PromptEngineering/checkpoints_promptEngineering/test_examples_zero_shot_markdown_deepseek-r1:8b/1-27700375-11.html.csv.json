    "claim": "jordan farmar lead the team in assist for more game than deron williams do",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"jordan farmar lead the team in assist for more games than deron williams do\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games compared to Deron Williams. So, essentially, I need to check how many times each of them was the top assistant in their respective games and see if Farmar's count is higher than Williams'.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 81 rows, but only a subset has relevant information about assists and high points. The columns related here are \"high assists\" for each game. I should identify the cells where either Farmar or Williams had the highest assists in that game.\n\nI'll go through each row and see who led in assists:\n\n- **Row 75**: High rebounds by Brandan Wright, not Farmar or Williams.\n- **Row 76**: High rebounds by Travis Outlaw, but high points by Deron Williams. However, the column for assists is deron williams with 9, so maybe he also led here? Wait, no\u2014high points is a different metric. The claim is about assists, so I should look at \"high assists.\"\n  \nWait, in row 76, under \"high assists\" it's deron williams (9). So that's one game where Williams led.\n\n- **Row 77**: High points by Brook Lopez, but high rebounds and assists by different people. The \"high assists\" is deron williams with 21. So Williams leads here as well. That's his second game.\n\n- **Row 78**: High rebounds by Brook Lopez, and high points by him too. For assists, it's jordan farmar (11). So Farmar leads in this game.\n\n- **Row 79**: High points again by Lopez, but \"high rebounds\" are by someone else. The \"high assists\" here is jordan farmar with 9. So that's another game where Farmar leads.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the table again:\n\nRow 78: high rebounds are Brook Lopez (7), so not relevant for assists. But \"high assists\" are Jordan Farmar (11). That counts as one game where Farmar led in assists.\n\nSimilarly, row 79: high rebounds by Jordan Farmar (8), but high points by Lopez. For assists, it's jordan farmar (9) leading, so that's another game where Farmar leads.\n\nSo, up to now:\n\n- Williams has led in games 76 and 77 (two games)\n- Farmar has led in games 78 and 79 (two games)\n\nWait, but let me check the rest of the table. The last row is 81, which is April 11 against Charlotte. High rebounds by Dan Gadzuric, high points by Lopez, assists by Jordan Farmar (9). So that's another game where Farmar leads.\n\nSo now:\n\n- Williams: games 76 and 77 (2)\n- Farmar: games 78,79,81 (3)\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each row for the \"high assists\" column to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nRow 75: deron williams (7) in assists. So Williams leads here as well? Wait no, in row 75, the high points are Brandan Wright (15), but the high rebounds and assists might be different. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn row 75, \"high rebounds\" is Brandan Wright (11), and \"high assists\" is deron williams (7). So that's another game where Williams led in assists.\n\nSo updating:\n\n- Williams: rows 75,76,77 (3)\n- Farmar: rows 78,79,81 (3)\n\nWait, row 80: let me check. Row 80 is April 10 against Toronto. High points by Lopez (35). \"High rebounds\" by Brook Lopez (11), and \"high assists\" by Jordan Farmar (7). So that's another game where Farmar leads in assists.\n\nSo now:\n\n- Williams: rows 75,76,77 (3)\n- Farmar: rows 78,79,80,81 (4)\n\nWait, row 80: high rebounds by Brook Lopez, but high assists by Jordan Farmar. So that adds one more to Farmar's count.\n\nNow let me recount:\n\nRow 75: Williams leads in assists.\nRow 76: Williams leads.\nRow 77: Williams leads.\nRow 78: Farmar leads.\nRow 79: Farmar leads.\nRow 80: Farmar leads.\nRow 81: Farmar leads.\n\nSo Williams has 3 games, Farmar has 4. That would mean the claim is FALSE because Farmar led in more games than Williams.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any other rows where either of them could have led. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 75: deron williams (7) - Williams leads.\nRow 76: deron williams (9) - Williams.\nRow 77: deron williams (21) - Williams.\nRow 78: jordan farmar (11) - Farmar.\nRow 79: jordan farmar (9) - Farmar.\nRow 80: jordan farmar (7) - Farmar.\nRow 81: jordan farmar (9) - Farmar.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. Williams has three games, Farmar has four. Therefore, the claim is saying that Farmar led in more games than Williams. Since 4>3, the claim would be TRUE? Wait no\u2014the claim says \"more games than deron williams do,\" meaning Farmar leads in assists in more games than Williams does. So since Farmar has 4 and Williams has 3, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but I thought the user might have made a mistake because initially, I thought it was three each, but upon checking all rows, it's four for Farmar.\n\nSo the answer should be \"TRUE\" with relevant cells being each row where either leads in assists.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that Jordan Farmar led in more games than Deron Williams. After reviewing each game:\n\n- **Deron Williams** led in 3 games (rows 75,76,77).\n- **Jordan Farmar** led in 4 games (rows 78,79,80,81).\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"title\": \"Analysis of Leading Assists\",\n    \"description\": \"Determine who leads in assists across the games.\",\n    \"results\": {\n      \"deron_williams\": 3,\n      \"jordan_farmar\": 4\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this table with eight columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. The claim is that Brook Lopez led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game three different times.\n\nFirst, I need to check each game in the table to see if Brook Lopez was the top scorer in both points and rebounds for his team.\n\nLooking at row 0 (game 75): high points are 15 by Brandan Wright, so that's not Lopez. So he didn't lead in points here.\n\nRow 1 (game 76): high points are 18 by Deron Williams, so again, no.\n\nRow 2 (game 77): high points are 30 by Brook Lopez. Now, I need to check rebounds too. High rebounds here are 12 by Lopez as well. So in this game, he led both in points and rebounds.\n\nRow 3 (game 78): high points are 39 by Lopez. Rebounds are 7 by Lopez as well. So that's another game where he led both stats.\n\nRow 4 (game 79): high points are 27 by Lopez. But the rebounds here are 8 by Jordan Farmar, so Lopez didn't lead in rebounds this time. So only points.\n\nRow 5 (game 80): high points are 35 by Lopez. Rebounds are 11 by Lopez again. That's another game where he led both.\n\nRow 6 (game 81): high points are 31 by Lopez. Rebounds are 8 by Dan Gadzuric, so no on rebounds.\n\nSo in games 77, 78, and 80, Brook Lopez led the team in both points and rebounds.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that the Nets only won games when they played at the Prudential Center. So I need to check if all their wins are recorded under games played there, and see if any other locations have wins.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of games from 75 to 81. Each row has details like game number, date, opponent team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nI should focus on the 'location' column to check where each win occurred. The relevant columns here are 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', but specifically for this claim, I'm looking at the 'location attendance' because the claim is about where they played.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the location is listed as 'location attendance'. So that's a single column, so maybe it's better to check if each win was at Prudential Center or not.\n\nSo first, I need to identify which games were wins. A win would be when their score starts with a 'w', like 'w 107 - 105 (ot)' in row 77 and 'l 94 - 108 (ot)' is a loss.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nRow 75: l 90 - 115 (ot) \u2192 Loss\nRow 76: l 94 - 108 (ot) \u2192 Loss\nRow 77: w 107 - 105 (ot) \u2192 Win\nRow 78: l 109 - 116 (ot) \u2192 Loss\nRow 79: l 93 - 116 (ot) \u2192 Loss\nRow 80: l 92 - 99 (ot) \u2192 Loss\nRow 81: l 103 - 105 (ot) \u2192 Loss\n\nSo only Row 77 is a win. Now, I need to check where that game was played.\n\nLooking at the 'location attendance' column for row 77: it's listed as \"prudential center\". So their one win was at Prudential Center.\n\nBut the claim says \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center.\" Does this mean all their wins, which is just one, are there? Yes. But wait, maybe I'm missing other games where they might have won but location isn't specified here.\n\nWait, in the given table, it's games from 75 to 81, so maybe beyond that, but according to this data, only game 77 is a win and it was at Prudential Center. So the claim would be TRUE based on this.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other wins elsewhere in the table. Looking again, all other games are losses, so their only win is at Prudential Center. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center\" is supported by the data as only one game (Row 77) was a win and it occurred at Prudential Center.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 76, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So I need to check the \"location attendance\" and \"team\" columns.\n\nFor each game where the team is Miami, I should look up their attendance numbers. Then compare which of those games has the highest attendance. Finally, verify if that highest attendance is indeed the most among all such games.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 76: April 3, Miami at Prudential Center with attendance 18,711.\nRow 77: April 5, Minnesota at Prudential Center but opponent isn't Miami.\nRow 78: April 6, Detroit at Palace of Auburn Hills, not Prudential or Miami.\nRow 79: April 8, New York at Prudential Center, opponent is not Miami.\nRow 80: April 10, Toronto at Air Canada Centre, not relevant.\nRow 81: April 11, Charlotte at Prudential Center, not Miami.\n\nSo the only game against Miami in the table is row 76 with attendance 18,711.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"brook lopez lead the team in points for 5 straight games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the relevant information from the table that could potentially support or refute the claim. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Player**: Brook Lopez\n2. **Statistic**: Points (high points)\n3. **Timeframe**: 5 consecutive games\n\nI need to check each game in the table and see if Brook Lopez was the team's leader in points for five straight games.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, etc. Each row represents a different game, so I'll have to go through each one.\n\nStarting from game 75 onwards:\n\n- **Game 75**: April 1 vs Philadelphia. High points are brandan wright with 15.\n- **Game 76**: April 3 vs Miami. High points by deron williams (18).\n- **Game 77**: April 5 vs Minnesota. Brook Lopez scored 30, which is the high points here.\n- **Game 78**: April 6 vs Detroit. High points are brook lopez with 39.\n- **Game 79**: April 8 vs New York. Lopez again leads with 27 points.\n- **Game 80**: April 10 vs Toronto. Lopez scores 35, leading the team.\n- **Game 81**: April 11 vs Charlotte. Lopez has 31 points.\n\nWait, but the games listed go from 75 to 81, which is seven games in total. The claim mentions \"5 straight games.\" So I need to see if there's a sequence of five consecutive games where Lopez was the top scorer.\n\nLooking at the high points per game:\n\n- Game 77: Lopez leads with 30\n- Game 78: Lopez leads with 39\n- Game 79: Lopez leads with 27\n- Game 80: Lopez leads with 35\n- Game 81: Lopez leads with 31\n\nSo from games 77 to 81, that's five consecutive games (77,78,79,80,81) where Lopez was the top scorer. Wait, no\u2014the games go up to 81, so if we count starting from game 77 as the first, then 77-81 are five games.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the numbering. The table starts at game 75 and goes up by two each time? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the table has rows labeled 75,76,77,78,79,80,81. So each row is a separate game, with increasing numbers from 75 to 81.\n\nSo in these seven games, Brooks Lopez leads his team's points in five of them: games 77,78,79,80,81. That's five consecutive games (from April 5 to April 11). \n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"5 straight games.\" So if there are five consecutive games where Lopez led, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nHowever, looking at the dates:\n\n- Game 77: April 5\n- Game 78: April 6\n- Game 79: April 8 (there's a gap here; the next game after 78 is 79 on April 8)\n- Game 80: April 10\n- Game 81: April 11\n\nWait, that's not five consecutive dates. Between game 77 and 78 is one day, then game 79 is two days later (April 8), so there's a gap of two days. Therefore, the games led by Lopez aren't strictly five in a row without breaks.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because the five games where Lopez was leading are not consecutive. For example:\n\n- Game 77: April 5\n- Game 78: April 6 (next day)\n- Then game 79: April 8 (two days later), so that's a break.\n- So from game 77 to 78, it's two consecutive games, then a non-consecutive one.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify dates; it just says five straight games. So maybe if the games are in sequence regardless of date? But usually, \"straight games\" implies consecutive in terms of when they occurred.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The table lists seven games. For each game, check if Lopez was the leader. If there's a stretch of five where he was the leader, then TRUE; else, FALSE.\n\nLooking at the high points:\n\n- Game 77: Lopez leads\n- Game 78: Lopez leads\n- Game 79: Lopez leads\n- Game 80: Lopez leads\n- Game 81: Lopez leads\n\nThat's five games in a row where he was leading. Wait, but let me count from game 77 to 81: that's five games (77,78,79,80,81). Even though there are breaks between the dates, the numbering suggests they're consecutive games.\n\nWait, no\u2014the numbering is just sequential; it doesn't necessarily mean they were played consecutively. But I think in sports, each game is considered a separate event, so the date gaps might not matter for the \"straight\" part\u2014it's about five games in a row, regardless of when they were played.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because \"five straight games\" would imply consecutive games, which are played one after another. So if there's a break between two games, even if Lopez leads in those five, it wouldn't count as five straight because the games themselves weren't played consecutively.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify: The claim says \"lead the team in points for 5 straight games.\" Does that mean five consecutive games (played one after another without breaks) or just any five games in a row in terms of sequence?\n\nIn sports terminology, \"straight\" usually refers to consecutive games played, not necessarily on consecutive dates. So if the team plays multiple games in a day, that's possible, but in reality, they don't play multiple games in one day.\n\nSo in this table, each game is on a separate date. Therefore, to have five straight games where Lopez leads, he would need to lead in five games played consecutively.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\nGame 77: April 5\n\nGame 78: April 6 (next day)\n\nThen Game 79: April 8 (two days later)\n\nSo between game 78 and 79, there's a two-day gap. Therefore, they are not consecutive games played on consecutive dates.\n\nTherefore, the five games where Lopez leads aren't all played consecutively; thus, he didn't lead in five straight games.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused again because \"five straight games\" could be interpreted as five games in a row in terms of the game sequence, not necessarily the date. For example, if they play multiple games in a day (which isn't common), or if the dates are such that they're considered consecutive for some reason.\n\nBut given that each game is on a separate date, and the next game after 78 is two days later, it's clear that there's a break between game 78 and 79. Therefore, games 77-81 aren't five straight games because there are breaks in between.\n\nThus, the claim would be incorrect, as Lopez didn't lead in five consecutive games.\n\nWait, but in reality, each game is considered a separate entity; they don't have to be played consecutively unless specified. So if you look at the list of games where he led, and see if there's any stretch of five in a row without interruption, then yes, from 77 to 81, that's five in a row.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if game numbers are assigned sequentially regardless of when they were played, then five consecutive game numbers imply five straight games. So maybe the claim is referring to the sequence in the list, not the actual dates.\n\nSo if game 77 is first, 78 next, etc., and he leads from 77 to 81, that's five straight games in terms of their listing order, even if they're not played on consecutive dates.\n\nThat might be the intended interpretation. So whether or not the actual games were played consecutively, the numbering implies a sequence, so five game numbers in a row where he leads would count as five straight games.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this. It depends on how \"straight\" is meant to be interpreted. If it's about consecutive games played in reality (i.e., without breaks between them), then because of the date gaps, it's FALSE. But if it's just about five game numbers in a row in the list, regardless of dates, then it's TRUE.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify whether \"straight\" refers to the date or just the sequence, I think the intended meaning is that they're consecutive in the list, so the answer would be TRUE.\n\nTherefore, Brooks Lopez led his team in five straight games (games 77-81), so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Brooks Lopez led his team in five consecutive games numbered 77 to 81, which are listed sequentially despite the actual date gaps. \n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{\\text{True}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"brook lopez lead the team in assist for more games than deron williams do\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Brook Lopez led his team in assists for more games compared to Deron Williams. So, I need to check each game and see who had more assists: was it Lopez or Williams?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game, with columns like date, team, score, high points, etc., but what's important here is the \"high assists\" column. Each entry there should tell me which player had the highest number of assists in that particular game.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one.\n\nStarting from game 75: the high assist was deron williams with 7. So Lopez didn't lead here.\n\nGame 76: same thing, deron williams has 9 assists, so again not Lopez.\n\nGame 77: deron williams leads with 21 assists. Still Williams.\n\nGame 78: jordan farmar is listed as the high assist with 11, so neither Lopez nor Williams.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Lopez leading more times than Williams, so perhaps I should only compare them when they are both in the same game? Or maybe each time one of them leads, it counts as a \"lead\" by that player.\n\nBut wait, in some games, other players have higher assists. For example, game 78, Farmar leads. So does that mean neither Lopez nor Williams led in that game? The claim is specifically about Lopez leading over Williams, so I should only consider games where either of them was the leader.\n\nLet me list out each game's high assists:\n\nGame 75: Deron Williams - 7\nGame 76: Deron Williams - 9\nGame 77: Deron Williams -21\nGame 78: Jordan Farmar -11\nGame 79: Jordan Farmar -8\nGame 80: Jordan Farmar -7\nGame 81: Jordan Farmar -9\n\nSo, in none of the games does Brook Lopez lead in assists. He isn't even listed as the high assist in any game; only Deron Williams and others are.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table:\n\nIn row 75, high points: brandan wright (15)\nhigh rebounds: brandan wright (11)\nhigh assists: deron williams (7)\n\nRow 76: high points: deron williams (18), rebounds: outlaw (9), assists: deron (9).\n\nSo, in rows 75 and 76, Williams leads in assists.\n\nIn row 77, high points: Lopez (30), rebounds: Lopez (12), assists: Williams (21). So here, Williams leads again.\n\nRow 78: high points: Lopez (39), rebounds: Lopez (7), assists: Farmar (11).\n\nRow 79: high points: Lopez (27), rebounds: Farmar (8), assists: Farmar (9).\n\nRow 80: high points: Lopez (35), rebounds: Lopez (11), assists: Farmar (7).\n\nRow 81: high points: Lopez (31), rebounds: Gadzuric (8), assists: Farmar (9).\n\nSo, in all these games, either Williams or Farmar are leading in assists. Lopez is never the one with the highest assists in any game.\n\nTherefore, Lopez didn't lead the team in assists in more games than Williams; in fact, Williams led in at least two games where they were both playing. Since there's no row where Lopez leads in assists, the claim that he did so in \"more games\" is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 75, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 76, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 77, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 78, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 79, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 80, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 81, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"} ]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Travis Outlaw led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game three different times.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to see if Travis Outlaw had any games where he was the top in both points and rebounds.\n\nStarting from row 75: It's game 75 against Philadelphia. The high points are credited to Brandon Wright with 15, and high rebounds to him as well with 11. Deron Williams has 7 assists. So Travis didn't lead in either category here.\n\nNext is game 76 against Miami. High points go to Deron Williams with 18, and high rebounds to Travis Outlaw with 9. So he led in rebounds but not points that game.\n\nGame 77 against Minnesota: Brook Lopez scored 30 points and had 12 rebounds. Travis isn't mentioned here at all, so no impact on the claim.\n\nGame 78 against Detroit: Brook Lopez again leads with 39 points and 7 rebounds. No Travis involved.\n\nGame 79 against New York: Brook Lopez has 27 points, but Jordan Farmar gets 8 rebounds. Travis doesn't lead in either category.\n\nGame 80 against Toronto: Brook Lopez scores 35 points and 11 rebounds. So Travis isn't leading here.\n\nFinally, game 81 against Charlotte: Brook Lopez has 31 points, Dan Gadzuric has 8 rebounds. No mention of Travis again.\n\nLooking through all the games, I can see that in game 76, Travis led in rebounds but not points. However, the claim says he led in both categories in a single game three different times. From the table, Travis only once led in rebounds and never simultaneously led in both points and rebounds in any single game.\n\nSo, since there's no instance where Travis Outlaw led in both points and rebounds in the same game, let alone three times, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the nets' only win come at the air canada centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the data.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that the Nets have only wins at the Air Canada Centre. So I'm looking for games where the Nets won (the 'record' should be a win) and see if all those games are played at the Air Canada Centre.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, etc., down to 'location attendance' and 'record'. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'date', 'team', 'score', 'record', and 'location attendance'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 75: Game 75 against Philadelphia. Score is l 90 - 115 (ot), so a loss. Therefore, no win here.\n\nRow 76: Game 76 vs Miami. Score l 94 - 108 (ot). Also a loss. Not relevant.\n\nRow 77: Game 77 vs Minnesota. Score w 107 - 105 (ot). That's a win. Location is prudential center with attendance 13461.\n\nRow 78: Game 78 against Detroit. L 109 - 116 (ot), so a loss.\n\nRow 79: Game 79 vs NY. L 93 - 116 (ot). Loss again.\n\nRow 80: Game 80 against Toronto. W 92 - 99 (ot). That's another win, and the location is Air Canada Centre with attendance 17755.\n\nRow 81: Game 81 vs Charlotte. L 103 - 105 (ot). So a loss.\n\nNow, looking for wins by Nets:\n\n- Game 77: Win at prudential center.\n- Game 80: Win at Air Canada Centre.\n\nSo the claim says that all Nets' wins are only at Air Canada. But in this table, there's a win at prudential center as well (Game 77). Therefore, the statement is false because there's at least one win not at Air Canada.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Nets' only wins come at the Air Canada Centre. However, checking the table reveals a win against Minnesota at the Prudential Center, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"the most highly attended game be against minnesota at the prudential center.\" \n\nI'm looking for two things here: \n1. Whether Minnesota was the opponent in a game that had the highest attendance.\n2. Whether that game took place at the Prudential Center.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row of the table and check the relevant columns.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The 'game' column has numbers like 75, 76, etc., which probably correspond to the game number or index.\n- The 'date' tells when the game was played.\n- 'team' indicates who the home team was for that game.\n- 'location attendance' shows where the game was held and how many people attended.\n\nI need to identify all games where the location is Prudential Center because the claim mentions it. Then, among those, I'll check which had the highest attendance compared to other games.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Game 77: April 5 vs Minnesota at Prudential Center with attendance 13461.\n- Game 76: April 3 vs Miami at Prudential Center with attendance 18711.\n- Game 81: April 11 vs Charlotte at Prudential Center with attendance 13853.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again:\nGame 77 is against Minnesota, so that's the game in question. Now, I need to see if this was the most attended.\n\nComparing attendances for games at Prudential Center:\n- Game 76: 18711\n- Game 77: 13461\n- Game 81: 13853\n\nSo Game 76 had the highest attendance of 18,711. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the most highly attended game was against Miami, not Minnesota.\n\nWait, but I might have misread some games. Let me double-check each row's location:\n\nGame 75: Wells Fargo Center, so that's a different venue.\nGame 76: Prudential Center, attendance 18,711 vs Miami.\nGame 77: Prudential Center vs Minnesota with 13,461.\nGame 78: The Palace of Auburn Hills, so different venue.\nGame 79: Prudential Center vs NY, attendance 18,023.\nGame 80: Air Canada Centre, another venue.\nGame 81: Prudential Center vs Charlotte, 13,853.\n\nSo the highest attendance at Prudential Center was Game 76 with 18,711 against Miami. Therefore, the claim that the most highly attended game was against Minnesota is false because it's actually against Miami.\n\nBut wait, does the table include all games? It goes up to Game 81, but maybe there are more games not listed here. However, based on what's given, the highest attendance at Prudential Center is against Miami, so the claim about Minnesota being the most attended is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the game against Minnesota was the most highly attended at Prudential Center. By examining each relevant row, it's clear that Game 76 against Miami had a higher attendance than Game 77 against Minnesota.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
