The claim is about the 2018 season and specifically mentions that the air force - navy score is yet tbd.\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant information in the table. Let me look at each row for the 2018 season. Scanning through the table, I see a row for 2018 under the \"season\" column with the value \"2018\". \n\nLooking at the columns, there's \"air force - navy score\", so that's what we need to check. According to the table, in 2018, the air force - navy score is marked as tbd (to be determined). The claim states exactly that: \"the air force - navy score be yet tbd.\" So it looks like this statement matches exactly.\n\nI should make sure there's no other cell related to 2018 that might affect this. Let me check all columns for the 2018 row. There are entries for air force - army score, army - navy score, and others, but none of them relate directly to the specific claim being made about the air force vs. navy score.\n\nSo the relevant cell is the one in 2018 season under \"air force - navy score\". That's the only cell needed because it directly supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that in 1983, the Air Force - Navy score was 44 - 17.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and find the row for the season 1983. Scanning through the seasons, I see 1983 is indeed one of them. \n\nNow, I need to check the relevant columns for that year. The columns we're interested in are \"air force - navy score\", which is the second column. So, for the 1983 row, the Air Force - Navy score should be 44 -17.\n\nLooking at the table, under season 1983, the air force - navy score is listed as 44 -17. That matches exactly what the claim says. \n\nSince all the relevant information in the claim is supported by the data in the table without any discrepancies, I can conclude that the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1983, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions provided. The claim is: \"an army - navy game will be played on 10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a game between the Army and Navy, specifically scheduled for December 10, 2016, in Baltimore, MD.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: season, trophy winner, air force - navy score, air force - army score, and army - navy score. Each row corresponds to a specific season from 1972 to 2018.\n\nMy task is to check if there are any cells in the table that directly relate to the claim. The relevant information should be found in the 'army - navy score' column because the claim mentions an Army vs. Navy game.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find the row for the season 2016. However, scanning the table from 1972 onwards, I notice that after 2010, the seasons listed are 2011, 2012, and then it jumps to 2014, 2016, and 2018. There's no entry for every year in between; some years are skipped.\n\nIn the row for 2016, the 'army - navy score' column is filled with \"10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)\". Wait, but looking closely, it says \"tbd\" (to be determined) for the season and the other columns. So the 'army - navy score' cell mentions a specific date in December 2016.\n\nThe claim states that the game will be played on 10 Dec 2016 in Baltimore, MD. Since this exact information matches the 'army - navy score' column for 2016, it means the table supports the claim.\n\nBut I should also check other columns to ensure there's no conflicting or additional info. The other columns mention 'tbd' for season and other scores, which likely refers to pending determination. So the only relevant cell is in the 'army - navy score' column for 2016 row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this specific cell in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2016, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the 1983 season's air force - navy score being TBD is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has several columns: season, trophy winner, air force - navy score, air force - army score, and army - navy score. Each row corresponds to a different season from 1972 up to 2018.\n\nThe claim in question is about the 1983 season specifically mentioning that the air force - navy score was \"tbd\". So my first step is to find the relevant row for the 1983 season in the table.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that the row for 1983 has:\n- Season: 1983\n- Trophy winner: air force\n- Air force - navy score: 44 - 17\n- Air force - army score: 41 - 20\n- Army - navy score: 42 - 13\n\nNow, focusing on the claim: \"for the 1983 season, the air force - navy score be tbd\". The term \"tbd\" typically stands for \"to be determined\" or \"pending determination\". In sports contexts, this might mean that the result was not yet known at the time of the prediction or the trophy's retention was undecided.\n\nLooking at the table, the 1983 row shows a specific score: 44 - 17. This is a definite number, so it doesn't align with \"tbd\". There's no indication in the table that for the 1983 season, the air force - navy score was pending or undetermined; instead, it has a numerical result.\n\nFurthermore, I should check if there are any other relevant cells beyond the air force - navy score. The claim is about the specific score being tbd, so only that cell is directly related. The other columns (air force - army and army - navy) aren't mentioned in the claim, but it's good practice to ensure they don't contradict anything. However, since the claim doesn't refer to them, I can focus solely on the air force - navy score column.\n\nTherefore, the cell at row 1983 for \"Air Force - Navy\" is a specific number (44-17), which contradicts the claim that it was tbd. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 1983 season, the Air Force-Navy score was TBD. However, reviewing the table shows that the score for that season was 44-17, a specific number rather than TBD. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1983,\n      \"column_name\": \"Air Force - Navy\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the score for air force - navy have all been decided up until 2018\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that for the scores between Air Force and Navy, all games from 1972 to 2018 have their outcomes decided. That means each year listed in that range should have a score recorded under \"air force - navy.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are season, trophy winner, air force - navy score, air force - army score, and army - navy score. So for each season from 1972 to 2018, I need to check if the air force - navy score is filled in.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\nStarting with 1972: The air force - navy score is 21 - 17, so that's decided.\n\n1973: 42 - 6, decided.\n\n1974: 19 - 16, done.\n\n1975: 17 - 0, yes.\n\n1976: 13 - 3, yes.\n\n1977: 10 - 7, decided.\n\n1978: 37 - 8, yes.\n\n1979: 13 - 9, yes.\n\n1980: 21 - 20, done.\n\n1981: 30 - 13, yes.\n\n1982: 24 - 21, okay.\n\n1983: 44 - 17, decided.\n\n1984: 29 - 22, yes.\n\n1985: 24 - 7, yes.\n\n1986: 40 - 6, done.\n\n1987: 23 - 13, yes.\n\n1988: 34 - 24, okay.\n\n1989: 35 - 7, decided.\n\n1990: 24 - 7, yes.\n\n1991: Wait, the table skips to 2014. Let me check each year up to 2018.\n\nWait, looking at the provided data, I see that after 2012, there are entries for 2014, 2016, and 2018. But what about the years in between? For example, from 1991 to 2013, does the table have all scores filled in?\n\nI need to check if each season from 1972 through 2018 has an entry under \"air force - navy score.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- From 1972 to 2009: Each of these years has a value for air force - navy. For example, 2010 has 14 -6, 2011 has 35 -34 (ot), 2012 has 28 -21 (ot). So up to 2012, everything is filled.\n\nThen comes 2014: The score is \"tbd,\" which means it's not decided yet. Similarly, 2016 and 2018 also have \"tbd.\"\n\nSo from 1972 through 2013, the scores are decided. But in 2014, 2016, and 2018, they're still TBD.\n\nTherefore, the claim says all scores up until 2018 have been decided. However, since 2014, 2016, and 2018 are marked as \"tbd,\" meaning their outcomes aren't determined yet, the statement is not fully accurate for those years.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there's a row with season 2013 or later that might have a score after 2012 but before 2014. For example, maybe 2013 isn't listed in the table provided, but according to the data given, 2013 is missing and only starts again at 2014.\n\nSo, since 2014, 2016, and 2018 are \"tbd,\" their scores haven't been decided yet as of 2018. Therefore, the claim that all such scores up until 2018 have been decided is false.\n\nI should also check if any rows beyond 2012 have their air force - navy score filled in. From the table, after 2012 comes 2014 with \"tbd,\" so no, they're not decided. So, even though the claim might be referring to up until 2018, some scores in that period are still pending.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all Air Force vs. Navy game scores have been decided by 2018. However, entries for 2014, 2016, and 2018 show \"tbd,\" meaning their outcomes weren't determined as of that year. Therefore, the statement isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2012, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2014, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2016, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2018, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"all but 1 season be about to have or have an army - navy game in baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this claim means. It's saying that for all but one season listed in the table, there was either a scheduled or actual Army-Navy game held at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD.\n\nLooking at the table columns: 'season', 'trophy winner', 'air force - navy score', 'air force - army score', and 'army - navy score'. The claim is specifically about the 'army - navy score' column because it mentions an Army-Navy game. \n\nI need to check each season row's 'army - navy score' cell. If the value isn't null or doesn't indicate a game was played (like \"tbd\" for \"to be determined\"), then that season is excluded from the claim. However, if only one such season exists where no game was held, then the claim holds.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- 1972: Army - Navy score is 23-15. So a game was played.\n- 1973: 51-0. Game happened.\n- 1974: 19-0. Game occurred.\n- 1975: 30-6. Played.\n- 1976: 38-10. Game held.\n- 1977:17-14. Happened.\n- 1978:28-0. Played.\n- 1979:31-7. Yes.\n- 1980:33-6. Yes.\n- 1981:3-3. Yes, a game was there.\n- 1982:24-7. Happened.\n- 1983:42-13. Game occurred.\n- 1984 to 2009: I assume they are played as per usual until 2010 and beyond.\n\nNow, looking at the later rows:\n\n- 2010:31-17. Played in Baltimore? Wait, in 2010, the score is 14-6 for Air Force vs Navy, but under 'army - navy score' it's 31-17. So that game was played at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nWait, no: The claim is about Army-Navy games. Let me clarify. In each row, the columns are separate. So, in row 2010, 'army - navy score' is 31-17. So that's an Army-Navy game at Baltimore, so it counts.\n\nRows after:\n\n- 2011:27-21. Army-Navy game happened.\n- 2012:17-13. Game was played.\n- 2014: The 'army - navy score' is 'tbd'. That means the game wasn't held yet or determined. So this season (2014) doesn't have a game, which would be the only one where it didn't happen.\n- 2016: 'tbd', so no game.\n- 2018: 'tbd', same issue.\n\nSo, for seasons from 1972 to 2013, the Army-Navy game was held. In 2014, 2016, and 2018, it's TBD, meaning either not yet scheduled or not played. However, in the claim, it says \"all but 1 season be about to have or have an army - navy game\". So, the only exception is one season where it didn't happen.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple seasons with 'tbd' (2014, 2016, 2018) and maybe 2020 onwards not listed. But in the provided data, up to 2018, so three seasons without a game. Wait, but the claim says \"all but 1 season\". So if there are more than one, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The last two rows (2014 and 2016) have 'army - navy score' as TBD. If they were scheduled or played later, maybe that's a different story, but in the table, it's marked as TBD, which might indicate that the game wasn't held yet or at all.\n\nBut in 2018, it's just \"tbd\" without any further info, so no game was played there. That makes three seasons without a game: 2014, 2016, and 2018.\n\nWait, but maybe 2019 is missing? The user didn't provide data beyond 2018, but according to the table, from 2010 onwards:\n\n- 2010: Game happened.\n- 2011: Happened.\n- 2012: Happened.\n- 2014: TBD.\n- 2016: TBD.\n- 2018: TBD.\n\nSo that's three seasons where no game was played in Baltimore. Therefore, the claim says all but one season had a game, but there are actually multiple (three) seasons without a game. So the claim is false because it's not just one season, but several.\n\nWait, but looking again, perhaps 'tbd' doesn't necessarily mean the game wasn't played; maybe it was scheduled for a future date. For example, 2014's note says \"4 oct 2014 at air force\", which might be the location of another game, not Army-Navy. Similarly, 2016 and 2018 have their own scores.\n\nWait no, in row 2014: The 'army - navy score' is 'tbd', but under notes it says \"16 -13 (ot)\" for air force vs navy. So perhaps the Army-Navy game was still pending or not held yet. Similarly, 2016 and 2018 have 'tbd' in their army-navy scores.\n\nSo, assuming that 'tbd' means the game wasn't held at M&T Bank Stadium for that season, then there are multiple seasons (3) where it didn't happen. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not all but one, but more than one.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to find how many times the 'army - navy score' is non-zero or indicates a game was played in Baltimore.\n\nIf we assume that any row with a number in the army-navy score column indicates a game was held at M&T Bank Stadium, then the only seasons without a game are 2014, 2016, and 2018. Thus, three seasons where no game occurred, making the claim false because it's not all but one.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Army-Navy games were held from 1972 to 2013, then 'tbd' indicates no game was played in 2014, 2016, and 2018. This is more than one season without a game, so the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}",
