The claim says, \"the person with a qb rating of 82.7 score 136 touchdown.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for someone in the table who has a QB rating of exactly 82.7. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Charley Johnson: 69.6\n2. Jake Plummer: 69\n3. Jim Hart: 66.6\n4. Kurt Warner: 91.9\n5. Neil Lomax: 82.7\n\nOnly Neil Lomax has a QB rating of 82.7, so he's the person we're focusing on.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"136 touchdown.\" Looking at the 'touchdowns' column for Neil Lomax, it says 136. So that part checks out because Neil does have 136 touchdowns.\n\nPutting this together, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Neil Lomax has a QB rating of exactly 82.7 and 136 touchdowns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"qb rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"neil lomax.\" I should look this name up in the table to find the relevant row. Scanning through the names: charley johnson, jake plummer, jim hart, kurt warner, neil lomax. There's a row for Neil Lomax at the bottom.\n\nNext, the claim refers to the \"qb rating.\" Looking at the columns in the table, I see that there's a column named \"qb rating.\" So I need to check this specific cell for Neil Lomax.\n\nI should also make sure that all parts of the claim are addressed. The claim states that the qb rating is exactly 82.7. To verify this, I'll look at the value in the \"qb rating\" column for Neil Lomax's row.\n\nFrom the table, Neil Lomax has a qb rating of 82.7. That matches exactly what the claim is saying. So, the statement seems to be TRUE based on this information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Neil Lomax's QB rating is 82.7.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Charles Johnson having 2047 attempts is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has several columns: name, completions, attempts, completion %, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and qb rating. The rows are for different players, including Charles Johnson. The claim says that Charles Johnson had 2047 attempts.\n\nSo, my task is to verify if this number matches any cell in the table related to attempts for Charles Johnson.\n\nLooking at the table again, I can see each row corresponds to a player. For Charles Johnson, his row has:\n\n- name: charley johnson\n- completions: 1030\n- attempts: 2047\n- completion %: 50.3%\n- yards: 14928\n- touchdowns: 108\n- interceptions: 110\n- qb rating: 69.6\n\nI need to check if the number of attempts for Charles Johnson is indeed 2047 as claimed.\n\nIn the table, under the \"attempts\" column, Charles Johnson's attempt count is listed as 2047. So that matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the number of attempts for Charles Johnson in the table is 2047.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we check the relevant cell for Charles Johnson's attempts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant data points here are \"touchdowns\" and \"qb rating.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check for someone with 209 touchdowns first.\n\n1. Charley Johnson has 108 touchdowns.\n2. Jake Plummer has 90 touchdowns.\n3. Jim Hart has 209 touchdowns. Oh, that's the number we're looking for.\n4. Kurt Warner has 100 touchdowns.\n5. Neil Lomax has 136 touchdowns.\n\nSo, Jim Hart is the only one with 209 touchdowns. Now I need to check his QB rating. His QB rating is listed as 66.6, which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are satisfied: 209 touchdowns and a QB rating of 66.6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Jim Hart's data in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"100 touchdown be score when the qb rating be 82.7\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to link a specific number of touchdowns (100) with a specific QB rating (82.7). So, I'm looking for rows in the table where the QB rating is 82.7 and see if that row has exactly 100 touchdowns.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different quarterback: charley johnson, jake plummer, jim hart, kurt warner, and neil lomax. I'll go through each one by one.\n\nStarting with charley johnson: His QB rating is 69.6, which doesn't match 82.7, so this row isn't relevant.\n\nNext, jake plummer has a QB rating of 69, again not 82.7, so I can skip him too.\n\nThen, jim hart's QB rating is 66.6. Not the one either. \n\nMoving on to kurt warner: His QB rating is 91.9. That's higher than 82.7 but doesn't match exactly. So he's not relevant here.\n\nFinally, neil lomax has a QB rating of 82.7, which matches what the claim is checking. Now I need to look at his number of touchdowns. According to the table, he has 136 touchdowns. The claim states that when the QB rating is 82.7, there are 100 touchdowns. However, in this case, it's actually 136, not 100.\n\nSo, the claim isn't fully supported because the actual number of touchdowns doesn't match 100 when the QB rating is 82.7. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for verification. Since only neil lomax has a QB rating of 82.7, his row's touchdown cell is relevant. Looking at the columns, touchdowns are in the fifth column. His row index is 4 (since we start counting from 0), so the relevant_cells should be that specific cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the QB rating is 82.7, there would be 100 touchdowns. However, upon checking the table, Neil Lomax has a QB rating of 82.7 and 136 touchdowns, not 100.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand each column. The relevant columns for the claim are \"qb rating\" because the claim is specifically about that statistic. So, I'm focusing on the \"qb rating\" column in the table.\n\nNext, I need to find Kurt Warner's row in the table. Scanning through the names, I see \"kurt warner\" as one of the entries. Now, I should check what his QB rating is according to the table. \n\nLooking at the \"qb rating\" cell for Kurt Warner, it says 91.9. The claim states that his QB rating is 82.7. These two numbers don't match; 91.9 and 82.7 are different.\n\nSo, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table. It's false because the provided QB rating for Kurt Warner doesn't align with what's stated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"qb rating\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Charlie Johnson is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"charley johnson have 2754 attempt.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate Charlie Johnson's row in the table. Looking at the 'name' column, I see that the first entry is \"charley johnson\". So his row is the first one with index 0.\n\nNext, I need to look for the specific number mentioned in the claim. The claim refers to an attempt count of 2754. I should check each relevant column in Charlie Johnson's row to find where attempts are recorded.\n\nThe columns in the table are: name, completions, attempts, completion %, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and qb rating. 'Attempts' is one of these columns, so I'll look at that specific cell for Charlie Johnson.\n\nIn his row, the number under 'attempts' is 2047, as per the markdown table provided. Wait a minute, the claim says he has 2754 attempts, which doesn't match the figure in the table (which is 2047). That seems off. Did I read that correctly? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back: the row for Charlie Johnson shows 2047 attempts. The claim states 2754 attempts. That's a discrepancy. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the number of attempts doesn't match what's claimed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
