    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota 's leadership.\" So, I'm looking for a term start date of September 5, 1928, during Kostaq Kota's tenure.\n\nLooking at the table, there are four rows. The first row is a header with columns like name, born-died, term start, etc. Then each subsequent row represents different leaders: Kostaq Kota (twice), Pandeli Evangjeli, and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri.\n\nI need to check each leader's term start dates. \n\n- The first Kostaq Kota is in row 2 (since the header is row 1). His term start is September 5, 1928.\n- Then Pandeli Evangjeli starts on March 6, 1930.\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri starts on October 22, 1935.\n- The second Kostaq Kota starts on November 9, 1936.\n\nSo the earliest term start is indeed September 5, 1928. That's under Kostaq Kota's first term. \n\nNow, looking at the claim: it specifies \"under kostaq kota 's leadership.\" So we need to make sure that this term was when he was leading. The first Kostaq Kota row (row 2) is his first time in office, and that's where the September 5, 1928, term start is.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the earliest term start of September 5, 1928, occurred under Kostaq Kota's leadership as per the table. The relevant cells are his first term details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived to be the oldest prime minister, 1872 - 1963.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row represents a different prime minister or their terms.\n\nLooking for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri in the table. Scanning each row's name column:\n\n1. \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" \u2013 not him.\n2. \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" \u2013 nope.\n3. \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" \u2013 still not him.\n4. \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\" \u2013 yes, that's the one.\n\nNow, let's check his details. His born-died is 1872 - 1963. The claim mentions he lived to be the oldest prime minister in that range, so I need to see how long he served and if his lifespan aligns with being the oldest.\n\nLooking at the term start and end for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time): he started on October 22, 1935, and ended on November 9, 1936. So he served for about a year and a month. His term isn't the longest, but the claim is about his lifespan, not his tenure.\n\nHis born-died: from 1872 to 1963. That means he lived until 1963. The table shows that he died in 1963, so he did live up to 1963. However, the term end column for his first term is November 9, 1936, but he continued serving again? Wait, looking at the next rows: kostaq kota (2nd time) started on November 9, 1936, and ended in April 1939. So after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's first term ended, Kostaq Kota took over.\n\nSo the claim is about his lifespan, not his tenure duration. The table confirms that he was born in 1872 and died in 1963, so he lived to be 91 years old. Therefore, the claim seems correct based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's details in the table and found his lifespan matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"born - died\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"all prime minister on the list have no political party.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check the relevant columns. The columns I need to focus on are:\n\n1. **born - died**: This tells me when the individual was active, but it's not directly related to their political party.\n2. **term start**: This is the start date of their term as Prime Minister.\n3. **term end**: This is the end date of their term.\n4. **political party**: This is what I'm specifically looking for. The claim states that all have no political party, so if any row shows a party affiliation, the claim is false.\n\nLooking at each entry:\n\n- **First Row (Prime ministers 1928 - 1939)**: This seems to be an overall header or perhaps a placeholder without specific data. Since it's not a named individual, I might not need this unless it affects others.\n  \n- **Second Row (Kostaq Kota, first time)**: The political party is listed as \"non - party\". So no party affiliation here.\n\n- **Third Row (Pandeli Evangjeli, second time)**: Again, political party is \"non - party\".\n\n- **Fourth Row (Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri, first time)**: Political party is also \"non - party\".\n\n- **Fifth Row (Kostaq Kota, second time)**: Once more, the political party is \"non - party\".\n\nSince all named Prime Ministers listed have their political party as \"non - party\", there are no entries with a different affiliation. Therefore, the claim that all listed Prime Ministers have no political party seems to be true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if the header row counts as part of the list. The first row is labeled \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" and has the same columns as the others. However, it's not a named individual, so it doesn't contradict the claim. The other rows are all individuals without any political party mentioned.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the claim is TRUE because every listed Prime Minister does not have a political party.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that all listed prime ministers have no political party holds true based on the provided data.

Wait, let me double-check that.\n\nWait, no, Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term end is listed as 9 November 1936? Let me look again. Yes, in the table, under \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\", the 'term end' is 9 november 1936.\n\nSo, Kostaq Kota started his term on the same day Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri ended his. The claim says that Kostaq Kota's term start was after Mehdi's term end. But if they are on the exact same day, then it's not strictly after; it's concurrent. So, the claim might be incorrect.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim states that Kostaq Kota started his term on 9 November 1936, after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri ended his.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let's break down the claim first: \"kostaq kota mehdi bej frash\u00ebri be both 1st time prime minister of albania.\" \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. The way it's phrased makes me think there might be a mistake in the structure. It says both of them are \"1st time\" prime ministers. But looking at the table, I see that Kostaq Kota is listed twice: once as the 1st time and again as the 2nd time. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is also only listed once, but it's in the context of being a non-party Prime Minister serving during certain terms.\n\nSo, the claim seems to suggest that both Kostaq Kota (1st time) and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were 1st time Prime Ministers of Albania. But from the table, Kostaq Kota is indeed listed as the 1st time Prime Minister, but Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri isn't listed as a 1st time; he's only in one term. Wait, no, looking again: each row represents a different prime minister. So the first row is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", then another row for \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\", and so on. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The claim says both were 1st time PMs. Kostaq Kota has a 1st time entry in the table, but Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is only listed once as \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\", so maybe he's also a 1st time PM. But looking at the table structure: each row has name, birth-death, term start, term end, and political party. The first row is \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" which seems to be a header, but then it lists specific prime ministers with their terms.\n\nSo Kostaq Kota (1st time) served from September 5, 1928, to March 5, 1930. Then Pandeli Evangjeli took over from March 6, 1930, until October 16, 1935. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri started on October 22, 1935, and ended on November 9, 1936. Then Kostaq Kota again from November 9, 1936, to April 8, 1939.\n\nSo the claim is about both being 1st time PMs of Albania. From the table, Kostaq Kota is indeed listed as 1st time in the first row, and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is also listed as 1st time in his row. So the claim seems to be saying that both were their respective parties' first-time PMs? Wait, no, the political party for both is listed as \"non - party\". Hmm, but maybe that's a typo.\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\n- The header row says \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" under name, born-died, etc. Then each subsequent row lists specific PMs and their terms.\n\nSo Kostaq Kota (1st time) is one PM, then Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), then Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri as another PM, and then again Kostaq Kota in his 2nd term.\n\nSo the claim says that both Kostaq Kota (in his first term) and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were 1st time PMs. Wait, but looking at the table, Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is listed as \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\", so he was indeed a 1st time PM. Kostaq Kota is also in his first term. So both were 1st time PMs.\n\nWait, but perhaps the confusion comes from whether they are both considered 1st time in the same context. Maybe the claim is incorrect because there's only one Prime Minister at a time, so the idea that both served as 1st time might be conflicting. But no, each term is separate, and each PM has their own first term.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"be both 1st time prime minister of albania.\" So it's stating that both Kostaq Kota (1st) and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were 1st time. But looking at the table, Kostaq Kota is in his first term, while Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is also in his first term as per the row. So maybe the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the user meant that both served as Prime Minister of Albania for their first time during 1928-1939, but Kostaq Kota was PM twice: once in 1st term and again in 2nd. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri only once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that both were first-time PMs at some point, which seems correct based on the table.\n\nBut let me check each cell relevant to the claim. The claim mentions \"kostaq kota mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" being both 1st time PM. So in the table:\n\n- Kostaq Kota (1st time) is at row index 1, columns name, born-died, term start, term end, political party.\n\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is at row index 3, same columns.\n\nSo to check if both were 1st time PMs, the relevant cells would be their respective rows. So in the table, each of these individuals has a (1st time) designation in their name column.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement seems to align with the table: Kostaq Kota was 1st time PM, and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was also 1st time PM. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as both Kostaq Kota (1st time) and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were first-time Prime Ministers of Albania.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant columns are 'name', 'born - died', 'term start', and 'term end'. The claim refers to Albania's first PM starting their term in 1927, so I should look for the first occurrence of a PM whose term started around that time.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows provided:\n\n- Row 0: \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" with various details. Wait, but the names start from Row 1 onwards.\n- Row 1: kostaq kota (1st time), born 1889-1949, term started on September 5, 1928, ended March 5, 1930.\n- Row 2: pandeli evangjeli, 1859-1939, term started March 6, 1930, ended October 16, 1935.\n- Row 3: mehdi bej frash\u00ebri, 1872-1963, term started October 22, 1935, ended November 9, 1936.\n- Row 4: kostaq kota (2nd time), same born-died years, term started November 9, 1936, ended April 8, 1939.\n\nWait a minute, the claim is about Albania's first PM starting their term in 1927. So I should check if any of the PMs had a term start in 1927. However, looking at the table, the earliest term start is September 5, 1928 (Row 1). That would mean the first PM, kostaq kota, started his first term in 1928, not 1927.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rows. The first row is a header for \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939,\" which might be a general category rather than an individual. So perhaps the actual PMs start from Row 1 onwards.\n\nIn that case, kostaq kota's first term started in September 1928, which is after 1927. Therefore, the claim that the first PM began their term in 1927 would be incorrect because it started in 1928. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table's header includes all PMs from 1928-1939, and the individual terms are listed below. If so, the first term of the first PM was in 1928, not 1927.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the first PM, which would be kostaq kota. His term started in September 1928, so he didn't begin in 1927. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's asserting that the first PM started their term a year earlier than they actually did.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Albania's first prime minister began their term in 1927.

The table lists various Albanian Prime Ministers along with their terms and political parties. The claim in question is: \"Albania have be see prime minister come from a political party.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Albania has been seen to have a prime minister who comes from a political party. So, I need to check if there's at least one Prime Minister listed in the table who was affiliated with a political party.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different Prime Minister. The columns relevant here are \"name,\" \"born - died,\" \"term start,\" \"term end,\" and \"political party.\" Since the claim is about whether they come from a political party, the key column to focus on is \"political party.\"\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: This seems to be a header for Prime Ministers in the 1928-1939 period. The political party here is listed as \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939,\" which I think is just categorizing them as part of that time period rather than an actual party name.\n\n2. **Second Row**: Kostaq Kota (1st time). His political party is listed as \"non - party.\" So he wasn't affiliated with any specific political party.\n\n3. **Third Row**: Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time). Again, his political party is marked as \"non - party.\"\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time). His political party is also \"non - party.\"\n\n5. **Fifth Row**: Kostaq Kota (2nd time). Same as before, non - party.\n\nSo, looking at all the rows, none of the listed Prime Ministers are from a specific political party. They're all marked as \"non - party.\" Therefore, the claim that Albania has had a Prime Minister who comes from a political party isn't supported by this table data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. The first row is a header, so it's not providing information about individual Prime Ministers. So, in the actual data rows (from index 1 to 5), all have \"non - party\" as their affiliation. That means none of them are from any political party.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because there's no evidence in the table that any of the listed Prime Ministers were from a political party.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the second oldest prime minister after pandeli evangjeli.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the second-oldest Prime Minister, right after Pandeli Evangjeli. So, in other words, when comparing their ages, Pandeli would be older than Mehdi.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several rows with different prime ministers and their respective terms. The relevant columns here are \"name,\" \"born - died,\" and probably \"term start\" or \"term end\" because age is related to the time of birth and death. But since we don't have individual ages listed, I'll need to calculate the ages at specific points in time.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows**: The claim mentions two names: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri and Pandeli Evangjeli. So, I should look for these in the table.\n   \n   - \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" is listed as the 3rd row (index 3 if we start counting from 0) under the first occurrence with a term start of October 22, 1935, and term end on November 9, 1936.\n   - \"pandeli evangjeli\" is in the second row (index 2), serving from March 6, 1930, to October 16, 1935.\n\n2. **Determine their lifespans**: \n\n   - Pandeli Evangjeli was born in 1859 and died in 1939.\n   - Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was born in 1872 and died in 1963.\n\n3. **Calculate their ages at specific points**:\n\n   - For Pandeli, his term started on March 6, 1930, and ended on October 16, 1935. He was born in 1859.\n     - At the start of his term (March 1930), he would be approximately 71 years old (1930 - 1859 = 71).\n     - His term ended in October 1935, so by then, he would have turned 76.\n\n   - For Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri, his first term started on October 22, 1935, and ended on November 9, 1936. He was born in 1872.\n     - In October 1935, he would be approximately 63 years old (1935 - 1872 = 63).\n     - By the end of his term in November 1936, he'd turn 64.\n\n4. **Compare their ages**:\n\n   - At the time Pandeli was prime minister (starting in March 1930), Mehdi was not yet in office. So, at that point, Pandeli would be older than Mehdi.\n   - When Mehdi took over as prime minister in October 1935, Pandeli had already left office. By this time, Mehdi was 63, and Pandeli would have been around 76 by the end of 1935.\n\n5. **Assess the claim**:\n\n   The claim states that Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli. Looking at their ages during their overlapping terms or relevant periods:\n   \n   - Pandeli was older than Mehdi at the time of his term (71 vs. Mehdi's 63 in 1935).\n   - By the end of 1936, Mehdi would be 64, while Pandeli had died in 1939. So, after Pandeli's death, Mehdi would still not have been a prime minister in that period.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify whether it's about their ages at any specific time or their lifespan. If we're talking about who lived longer, then both were alive beyond each other's terms. Pandeli died in 1939, and Mehdi in 1963. So, Mehdi was older than Pandeli by that measure.\n\nBut the claim is specifically comparing them as prime ministers, not necessarily in their lifespans. It mentions \"second oldest prime minister after.\" So it's about their age during their term or at some point when they were both in office.\n\nI think the key here is to look at their ages while they were serving as prime ministers. Pandeli was older than Mehdi during his term, and when Mehdi took over, he was 63, whereas Pandeli had already been born in 1859, so by then, Pandeli would have been older.\n\nWait, no\u2014Pandeli died in 1939, which is after Mehdi's first term. So, in 1935, when Mehdi started, Pandeli was still alive but not in office yet. Wait, no, Pandeli's term ended in October 1935, and Mehdi started in October 22, 1935. So, by the time Mehdi took over, Pandeli had already stepped down. Therefore, at that point, Mehdi would be older than anyone who had served before him, including Pandeli.\n\nBut wait, let me clarify:\n\n- Pandeli was born in 1859 and died in 1939.\n- Mehdi was born in 1872 and died in 1963.\n\nAt the time of Mehdi's first term (starting October 22, 1935), he would be 63 years old. At that point, Pandeli had already finished his term in October 1935, so Pandeli would have been 76 at that time (1935 - 1859 = 76). So, when Mehdi started, he was 63, making him younger than Pandeli.\n\nHowever, after Pandeli's death in 1939, Mehdi is still alive. So, by the end of their lives, Mehdi would have been older. But the claim is about being the second oldest prime minister \"after\" Pandeli, implying at a point when both were active.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is stating that Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli, meaning that Pandeli was the oldest, and Mehdi was the next. So, in terms of age during their time as PMs, Pandeli would be older than Mehdi. Therefore, the claim would be incorrect because Mehdi was younger when he served.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering lifespan, since Mehdi lived until 1963 and Pandeli died in 1939, Mehdi would have been older. But the table only shows their terms as prime ministers, not their full lifespans beyond that.\n\nBut looking back at the table's \"born - died\" column:\n\n- Pandeli Evangjeli: 1859 - 1939\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: 1872 - 1963\n\nSo, Pandeli was born in 1859 and died in 1939. Mehdi was born in 1872 and lived until 1963.\n\nTherefore, Mehdi was older than Pandeli by about 13 years (1963 - 1939 = 24; 1939 - 1872 = 67). Wait, no\u2014Mehdi's lifespan is longer, but their birth years make Mehdi younger than Pandeli. Pandeli was born in 1859, so he would have been older than Mehdi, who was born in 1872.\n\nBut the claim says Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli. If \"after\" refers to time, like after Pandeli died, then Mehdi was still alive and thus the oldest. But if it's about being a prime minister after each other, meaning during their overlapping terms or as successors, then Mehdi would have been younger than Pandeli.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of who lived longer. Since Pandeli died in 1939 and Mehdi in 1963, Mehdi was older overall. But the claim is about being a prime minister after each other. So, as PMs, when both served, Pandeli was older.\n\nI think the key is that during their overlapping periods as PMs, which would have been when both were active at the same time, but actually, they didn't overlap because Pandeli's term ended before Mehdi's began. So, in 1935, when Mehdi started, Pandeli had already finished his term.\n\nTherefore, in terms of age during their tenure as PMs:\n\n- Pandeli was older than Mehdi by about 13 years (76 vs. 63).\n- After that, Mehdi continued to live until 1963, so he was older overall, but as PMs, they didn't serve at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be incorrect because it implies that Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli as a prime minister, which would mean in terms of age during their overlapping service. But since they didn't overlap, this comparison doesn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simpler: It's about who lived longer. So, if we consider \"oldest\" meaning older at death, then Mehdi was older than Pandeli. Therefore, the claim that Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli would be incorrect because Mehdi was actually older than Pandeli in lifespan.\n\nBut the term \"second oldest\" could also mean in terms of age during their service as PMs. Since they didn't overlap, it's tricky. Alternatively, if considering who was older when both were serving, but since they didn't serve at the same time, this doesn't apply.\n\nI think the most accurate interpretation is that Mehdi lived longer than Pandeli, so he was the oldest after Pandeli died. Therefore, the claim that Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli would be incorrect because he was actually older than Pandeli in lifespan.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"second oldest\" refers to age during their service or overall lifespan. The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the ambiguity, it's likely that the claim is incorrect because Mehdi was older than Pandeli both in lifespan and possibly in age during overlapping periods (if we assume they did serve at similar times, which they didn't). So, the answer would be that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the second oldest prime minister after Pandeli Evangjeli is incorrect. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Pandeli's Tenure:** Pandeli Evangjeli served as Prime Minister and died in 1939 at the age of 80.\n2. **Mehdi's Tenure:** Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri became Prime Minister later, starting his term in October 1935, by which time Pandeli had already left office.\n3. **Age Comparison:** At the start of Mehdi's term, he was 63 years old, making him younger than Pandeli (76 at that time).\n4. **Lifespan Comparison:** Mehdi lived until 1963, surpassing Pandeli in lifespan, but as Prime Ministers, they did not serve concurrently.\n\nTherefore, Mehdi was not the second oldest after Pandeli during their overlapping periods or in terms of age. The claim is based on an incorrect comparison of their lifespans rather than their service timelines.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was not the second oldest prime minister after Pandeli Evangjeli; he was younger during his tenure and later became the longest-lived, but not in relation to Pandeli's term.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the only 1st time minister of albania be pandeli evangjeli\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only first-time minister of Albania. Looking at the table, I see several rows with different names and their terms. The term \"1st time\" might refer to someone holding the position for the first time, but I'm not entirely sure if that's how it's used here.\n\nLet me look at each row in the table:\n\n1. **Prime Ministers 1928 - 1939**: This seems like a header, maybe indicating a specific period of prime ministership.\n2. **Kostaq Kota (1st time)**: His term is from September 5, 1928, to March 5, 1930. He's listed under \"non - party\".\n3. **Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time)**: Born in 1859 and died in 1939, his second term started on March 6, 1930, and ended on October 16, 1935. He's also non-party.\n4. **Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time)**: Born in 1872, died in 1963, term from October 22, 1935, to November 9, 1936. Non-party.\n5. **Kostaq Kota (2nd time)**: His second term started on November 9, 1936, and ended on April 8, 1939. Non-party.\n\nWait, the claim is about being \"the only 1st time minister.\" So I need to check if Pandeli Evangjeli was a first-time minister and whether he's unique in that regard.\n\nLooking at the table, Kostaq Kota has both a 1st and 2nd term. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri also is listed as 1st time. So they have multiple terms. Pandeli Evangjeli is listed as (2nd time), meaning he served before, perhaps in an earlier period not covered by the table.\n\nSo if Pandeli was a minister before and then again in this period, he might have been a first-time minister in another term not shown here. But based on the data given, during 1928-1939, there were multiple first-time ministers: Kostaq Kota (1st time) and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time). Pandeli Evangjeli was already serving for his second time in this period.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he is \"the only 1st time minister\" during this period seems false because there are others who were first-time ministers at the same time or before. So I need to verify if there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the table includes all the relevant ministers from 1928-1939. If Pandeli Evangjeli was a second-term prime minister, then during this period, he isn't a first-time minister anymore. The claim says \"the only 1st time minister,\" but there are others who were first-time ministers in that time or before.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were also first-time ministers during that period. Therefore, it's not true that Pandeli was the only one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Pandeli Evangjeli was the sole first-time minister of Albania during a specific period. However, examining the table reveals that Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were also first-time ministers during that time. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
