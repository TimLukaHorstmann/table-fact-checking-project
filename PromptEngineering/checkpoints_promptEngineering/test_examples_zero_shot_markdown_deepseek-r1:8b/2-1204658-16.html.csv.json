    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on this table. The claim says, \"each game be play at a different venue.\" Hmm, okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row in the table and check where each game was played. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"venue,\" and \"date.\" But since the claim is about venues being different for each game, I should focus on the \"venue\" column specifically.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Fitzroy vs University**: Venue is brunswick street oval.\n2. **Essendon vs Melbourne**: Venue is emcg.\n3. **Collingwood vs St Kilda**: Venue is victoria park.\n4. **South Melbourne vs Richmond**: Venue is lake oval.\n5. **Geelong vs Carlton**: Venue is corio oval.\n\nNow, I need to check if all these venues are unique or not. Let's list them out:\n\n- brunswick street oval\n- emcg\n- victoria park\n- lake oval\n- corio oval\n\nI'm not familiar with all of these, but from what I know, each venue seems different. There's no repetition here; each game is at a separate location. So that would mean the claim is true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure none are the same. Let me see:\n\n- brunswick street oval: Only appears once.\n- emcg: Only once.\n- victoria park: Once.\n- lake oval: Once.\n- corio oval: Once.\n\nYes, all unique. So each game is played at a different venue, which matches the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the \"venue\" column for each row.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"each game be play at a different venue\" is true, we need to check if all venues listed in the table are unique. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The \"venue\" column is crucial for this assessment.\n2. **Extract Venue Information:** List each venue from the table:\n   - Fitzroy vs University: brunswick street oval\n   - Essendon vs Melbourne: emcg\n   - Collingwood vs St Kilda: victoria park\n   - South Melbourne vs Richmond: lake oval\n   - Geelong vs Carlton: corio oval\n3. **Check for Uniqueness:** All listed venues are distinct; none repeat.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since each game is at a unique venue, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is TRUE, and all relevant cells in the \"venue\" column must be checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim made about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"south melbourne score more points than richmond and carlton combine.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this claim are the home team and their scores, as well as the away teams and their scores. The specific data to check will be the points scored by South Melbourne (as the home team) against Richmond and Carlton (both as away teams).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For South Melbourne: Their score is 18.12 (120). That's the points they scored.\n- For Richmond: They are the away team, with a score of 4.4 (28).\n- For Carlton: They are the away team with a score of 6.13 (49).\n\nThe claim states that South Melbourne's score is higher than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So, I'll add their points together.\n\nRichmond scored 4.4 which is 28 points.\nCarlton scored 6.13 which is 49 points.\nAdding these together: 28 + 49 = 77.\n\nNow, South Melbourne scored 18.12 (120) points. \n\nComparing 120 to 77, clearly 120 is greater than 77. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. Each relevant cell should be noted with their row index and column name.\n\n- South Melbourne's score: This is in the \"home team score\" column, which is row 4 (assuming rows start at 0; let me count: fitzroy is 0, essendon 1, collingwood 2, south melbourne 3, geelong 4. Wait, no, wait. The table starts with fitzroy as the first row, so row indices are 0 for fitzroy, 1 for essendon, 2 for collingwood, 3 for south melbourne, and 4 for geelong. So South Melbourne's score is in row 3, column \"home team score\".\n\n- Richmond's score: They are the away team, so their points are in the \"away team score\" column, which is row 5? Wait, let me check the table again.\n\nWait, no. The table has five rows:\n\n1. fitzroy\n2. essendon\n3. collingwood\n4. south melbourne\n5. geelong\n\nSo, each row corresponds to a home team, with their respective away team and scores.\n\nFor Richmond as an away team: Looking at the table, which row is Richmond in? Wait, the table lists the home teams on the left, so when Richmond is the away team, they would be in one of the rows where another team is the home. For example, in the fifth row, geelong is the home team, and their away team is Carlton. So, Richmond must be an away team in some other row.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\n- The first four rows are fitzroy, essendon, collingwood, south melbourne\u2014all as home teams. Their away teams are university, melbourne, st kilda, and richmond respectively. Then the fifth row is geelong with carlton as away team.\n\nSo, for Richmond: they are listed in the fourth row as the away team against south melbourne. So their score (4.4 (28)) is in the \"away team score\" column of that row, which is row 3 (since fitzroy is 0). Wait, no\u2014wait, the rows are:\n\nRow 0: fitzroy\nRow 1: essendon\nRow 2: collingwood\nRow 3: south melbourne\nRow 4: geelong\n\nIn Row 3, south melbourne (home) vs. richmond (away). So Richmond's score is in row 3, column \"away team score\".\n\nSimilarly, Carlton's score is in the fifth row (geelong as home), so row index 4, column \"away team score\".\n\nSo, relevant cells are:\n\n- South Melbourne's home team score: row 3, \"home team score\"\n- Richmond's away team score: row 3, \"away team score\"\n- Carlton's away team score: row 4, \"away team score\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be these three.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the scores of South Melbourne against the combined total of Richmond and Carlton.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I'll look at the table structure and see where the relevant information is stored.\n\nThe table has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date. The claim is about South Melbourne's points, so I should focus on their score. \n\nLooking through the rows, I see that South Melbourne is one of the home teams. Their score is 18.12 (120). To verify if they scored the most points, I need to compare this against all other teams' scores.\n\nI'll extract each team's score:\n\n1. Fitzroy: 13.16 (94)\n2. Essendon: 17.17 (119)\n3. Collingwood: 10.10 (70)\n4. South Melbourne: 18.12 (120)\n5. Geelong: 5.9 (39)\n\nNow, I'll list the scores in order to see which is the highest:\n\n- Fitzroy: 94\n- Essendon: 119\n- Collingwood: 70\n- South Melbourne: 120\n- Geelong: 39\n\nSouth Melbourne has the highest score at 120. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The home team's score for South Melbourne is in row 3 (since it starts from 0). The column name is \"home team score\". \n\nWait, no, looking again: the table has rows starting at index 0. Let me count:\n\n1. Row 0: Fitzroy\n2. Row 1: Essendon\n3. Row 2: Collingwood\n4. Row 3: South Melbourne\n5. Row 4: Geelong\n\nYes, South Melbourne is row 3. The column for their score is the second one, which is \"home team score\". So the relevant cell is row_index 3 and column_name \"home team score\".\n\nI should make sure to list only that cell in the relevant_cells array.

Let me start by understanding the claim. It's stating that in each game listed, no team scored more than 120 points.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five games, all played on 8 August 1908. The \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns list the teams that played against each other, along with their respective scores. My task is to check if any of these scores exceed 120 points.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\n1. First row: Home team Fitzroy scored 13.16 (94), and the away team University scored 11.7 (73). Both are below 120.\n2. Second row: Essendon scored 17.17 (119), Melbourne scored 8.11 (59). Essendon's score is just under 120, so that's okay.\n3. Third row: Collingwood scored 10.10 (70), St Kilda scored 7.9 (51). Both are well below 120.\n4. Fourth row: South Melbourne scored 18.12 (120), Richmond scored 4.4 (28). Here, the home team scored exactly 120 points.\n5. Fifth row: Geelong scored 5.9 (39), Carlton scored 6.13 (49). Both are below 120.\n\nThe claim says \"no team score more than 120.\" So, if any team scored over 120, it's FALSE; otherwise, TRUE. \n\nIn the fourth row, South Melbourne scored exactly 120, which is equal to 120, not exceeding it. The claim specifies \"more than,\" so I think that's acceptable. But wait, sometimes in scoring systems, the total points can be represented as a decimal or combined numbers. Here, 13.16 (94) might represent goals and behinds, but the point value is 94. Similarly, 18.12 (120) likely represents total points scored.\n\nSo, no team scored more than 120 points in any of these games because the highest was exactly 120. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because none of the teams scored more than 120 points in any game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's stating that all games were played on August 8, 1908. So, my task is to check each row in the table and see if the date for each game is indeed that same date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, and date. The key here is the 'date' column. I need to verify that every single game listed has the date \"8 august 1908.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. First row: Fitzyroy vs University of Melbourne? Wait, no, away team is university with a score of 11.7 (73). The venue is brunswick street oval, and the date is 8 August 1908. So that's correct.\n\n2. Second row: Essendon against Melbourne. Their scores are 17.17 (119) vs 8.11 (59). Venue is emcg, but the date here is also 8 August 1908. That matches.\n\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs St Kilda. Scores 10.10 (70) and 7.9 (51), venue at Victoria Park. Date again is 8 August 1908. All good.\n\n4. Fourth row: South Melbourne against Richmond, scores 18.12 (120) and 4.4 (28). Venue is Lake Oval. Date: 8 August 1908. Still matching.\n\n5. Fifth row: Geelong vs Carlton. Their scores are 5.9 (39) and 6.13 (49), played at Corio Oval, with the date being 8 August 1908. So that's correct too.\n\nWait a minute, so all five games have the same date? Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Fitzyroy: 8/8/1908\n- Essendon: same date\n- Collingwood: same\n- South Melbourne: same\n- Geelong: same\n\nYep, all of them have the date August 8, 1908. So the claim is stating that all games were played on that day. Since every game listed indeed has that date, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The 'date' column seems crucial here. Each row's date needs to be checked. So for each row, I'll note the 'row_index' and 'column_name'.\n\nSo, relevant_cells would include all rows where the date is 8 august 1908. That means every single row has this info.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I need to list each cell that's relevant. Each row has a date, so all five dates are relevant. So, for each row from 0 to 4, their 'date' column is what we're checking.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because every game was indeed played on August 8, 1908. And the relevant cells are all the date entries in each row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The second row also has a date of 8 August 1908.\n3. The third row is 8 August 1908 as well.\n4. Fourth row same date, and fifth row same.\n\nNone of the games in the table were played on 5 August 1908; they all took place on 8 August 1908. Therefore, the claim that \"all game be play on 5 august 1908\" is false because none of the games listed are from that date.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"no team score more than 110 points in a game\" is true based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has five columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date. Each row represents a different match between two teams.\n\nThe claim states that no team scored more than 110 points in any game listed in the table. So, my goal is to check all the scores in the 'home team score' and 'away team score' columns to see if any exceed 110.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Fitzroy vs University: Home score is 13.16 (94), away is 11.7 (73). Both are below 110.\n2. Essendon vs Melbourne: Home score is 17.17 (119), which is above 110, and away is 8.11 (59).\n3. Collingwood vs St Kilda: Home is 10.10 (70), away is 7.9 (51). Both under 110.\n4. South Melbourne vs Richmond: Home is 18.12 (120), which is above 110, and away is 4.4 (28).\n5. Geelong vs Carlton: Home is 5.9 (39), away is 6.13 (49). Both under 110.\n\nNow, focusing on the home team scores: \n- Fitzroy: 94\n- Essendon: 119 (exceeds 110)\n- Collingwood: 70\n- South Melbourne: 120 (exceeds 110)\n- Geelong: 39\n\nAnd away team scores:\n- University: 73\n- Melbourne: 59\n- St Kilda: 51\n- Richmond: 28\n- Carlton: 49\n\nSo, the home teams' scores for Essendon and South Melbourne are both over 110.

So there are five home teams in total.\n\nThe claim is about South Melbourne's score being the least among all teams. To verify this, I need to check each team's points against South Melbourne's points.\n\nLooking at the 'away team' column, each row lists a different away team with their scores. However, the claim is about South Melbourne's score as the home team. Wait, in the table, 'home team' and 'away team' are separate columns.

But the claim seems to be about South Melbourne's score relative to all other teams, regardless of whether they are home or away.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table lists five games on 8 August 1908. For each game, one team is home and another is away, with their respective scores. So, in the row for South Melbourne, they are playing Richmond as the away team. Their score is 4.4 (28). Now, I need to check all other teams' total points or just their points when they're home?\n\nWait, no, the claim isn't about their performance at home or away, but rather their overall points compared to every other team's overall points.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each team's score in this table and see if South Melbourne has the lowest. But in this table, each row is a single game, so each team only has one score here. So for example, fitzroy scored 13.16 (94), university scored 11.7 (73). But wait, that might be confusing because the 'away team' is listed as university, but their name doesn't match the home teams.\n\nWait, perhaps the table lists each game, so each row represents a different game between two teams on the same date. So for example, fitzroy hosted university, and South Melbourne hosted Richmond.\n\nIn that case, I need to look at all the points scored by each team in these games. The claim is that South Melbourne scored the least among all teams.\n\nSo let's list out all the scores from the table:\n\n- Fitzy: 13.16 (94)\n- Essendon: 17.17 (119)\n- Collingwood: 10.10 (70)\n- South Melbourne: 18.12 (120) as away against Richmond, but wait, in their own game, they scored 18.12 (120). Wait no, the row for South Melbourne is when they are the home team? Or not.\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nEach row has a home team and an away team. So:\n\n1. Fitzy vs University: Fitzy score 94, Univ 73\n2. Essendon vs Melbourne: Essendon 119, Melb 59\n3. Collingwood vs St Kilda: Colling 70, St K 51\n4. South Melbourne vs Richmond: S.M. 120, Rich 28\n5. Geelong vs Carlton: Geo 39, Carlt 49\n\nWait, but in row 4, the away team is Richmond. So South Melbourne's score when they are home is 18.12 (120). Their point here is higher than all other teams except maybe Collingwood?\n\nWait, let me list all the points:\n\nFitzy:94\nEssendon:119\nCollingwood:70\nSouth Melbourne:120\nGeelong:39\n\nSo South Melbourne has 120, which is actually one of the highest scores. That would contradict the claim that they have the least.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. The columns are home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, date. So each row is a game where a home team plays an away team.\n\nSo in this case, South Melbourne's game is against Richmond as the home team? Or is it that South Melbourne is away?\n\nWait no, looking at the 'home team' column for the fourth row: south melbourne. So they are playing as the home team against Richmond (away). So their score is 18.12 (120), and Richmond scored 4.4 (28).\n\nSo in this game, South Melbourne's points when they were home are 120.\n\nNow, to check all teams' total points across all games. Wait, but in this table, each team only has one score each, either as home or away.\n\nWait no, perhaps the table is listing multiple games on the same date. So for example, five different games happened on 8 August 1908 involving these teams. Each game's result is listed, with the home and away teams and their respective scores.\n\nIn that case, I need to collect all the points scored by each team in their respective games.\n\nSo let's see:\n\n- Fitzy: played as home against University, scored 94\n- Essendon: home vs Melbourne, 119\n- Collingwood: home vs St Kilda,70\n- South Melbourne: home vs Richmond,120\n- Geelong: home vs Carlton,39\n\nBut wait, that's only the home games. What about their away games? The table lists five games on the same date, but it's unclear if these are all the teams or just some.\n\nWait, perhaps each team is playing once here, so their score in this table is only from one game each. So to determine the total points for each team, we need to consider that they might have played multiple games elsewhere, but in this table, each team has only one score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering all teams' scores across these five games, and checking if South Melbourne's score (120) is indeed the lowest among all teams.\n\nLooking at the points:\n\n- Fitzy:94\n- Essendon:119\n- Collingwood:70\n- South Melbourne:120\n- Geelong:39\n\nSo the scores are 94, 119, 70, 120, and 39. The lowest is 39 by Geelong, followed by Collingwood at 70, then Fitzy at 94, Essendon at 119, and South Melbourne at 120.\n\nThus, South Melbourne's score of 120 is not the least; in fact, it's one of the higher scores among these teams. Therefore, the claim that \"south melbourne score the least point out of every team\" is false because Geelong scored lower (39) than South Melbourne (120).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each team's points in the provided table and determine if South Melbourne has the lowest score. The relevant cells are those indicating South Melbourne's score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe claim is false because Geelong scored 39 points, which is lower than South Melbourne's 120.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that every game in the table takes place at the same venue. So, my task is to check each game's venue and see if they're all identical.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five games listed:\n\n1. Fitzroy vs University at Brunswick Street Oval\n2. Essendon vs Melbourne at EMCG\n3. Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park\n4. South Melbourne vs Richmond at Lake Oval\n5. Geelong vs Carlton at Corio Oval\n\nNow, I'll list out the venues for each game:\n\n- Fitzroy: Brunswick Street Oval\n- Essendon: EMCG\n- Collingwood: Victoria Park\n- South Melbourne: Lake Oval\n- Geelong: Corio Oval\n\nNext, I need to check if all these venues are the same. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Brunswick Street Oval**: This is the venue for Fitzroy's game.\n2. **EMCG**: This is where Essendon and Melbourne played.\n3. **Victoria Park**: Home ground for Collingwood vs St Kilda.\n4. **Lake Oval**: South Melbourne's game took place here.\n5. **Corio Oval**: Geelong and Carlton played at this venue.\n\nNow, are all these venues the same? Let me check each one:\n\n- Brunswick Street Oval is a specific venue in Melbourne, commonly known as \"The Oval.\"\n- EMCG stands for Melbourne Cricket Ground, which is another well-known stadium.\n- Victoria Park is indeed another cricket ground in Melbourne, often used for Australian Rules Football matches.\n- Lake Oval is located in South Yarra, also used for various sports events.\n- Corio Oval is in Geelong, a regional city in Victoria.\n\nSo, all these venues are different. Each game was played at unique locations. Therefore, the claim that \"each game be play at the same venue\" is false because they're not all the same; each has its own distinct venue.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because each game was held at a different venue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"south melbourne score less point than richmond and carlton combine\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that South Melbourne's score is less than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So I need to look at their individual scores in the table and add Richmond and Carlton's scores together to see if South Melbourne's is indeed lower.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game where two teams play against each other. The columns are: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, and date.\n\nI'll start by locating South Melbourne in the table. Scanning the \"home team\" column, I see South Melbourne is listed as the home team in the fourth row (row index 3). Their score is 18.12 (120), which in footy terms means 18 goals and 12 behinds, totaling 120 points.\n\nNext, I need to find Richmond and Carlton's scores. From the \"away team\" column, Richmond is the away team for South Melbourne, and their score is 4.4 (28). Carlton is listed as an away team in the fifth row where Geelong plays them; Carlton scored 6.13 (49).\n\nSo now, I'll add Richmond's and Carlton's scores: 28 + 49 equals 77 points.\n\nComparing that to South Melbourne's score of 120 points, it's clear that 120 is greater than 77. Therefore, the claim that South Melbourne's score is less than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
