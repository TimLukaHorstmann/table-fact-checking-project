Bennie Oosterbaan and Mike Tully both play the end position.\n2. Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play the tackle position.\n\nI need to verify each part by checking the relevant cells in the table. The table has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. For the first part, I'm interested in the 'name' and 'position' columns where the names are Bennie Oosterbaan and Mike Tully, and the position is end.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row has position \"ends\" with names \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully.\" So that's one part verified.\n- For the second part about Ed Weir and Ralph Chase playing tackle, I'll look for their names in the 'name' column under 'tackles.'\n\nLooking at the 'tackles' row:\n- The name is \"ed weir ralph chase,\" which includes both Ed Weir and Ralph Chase.

The claim states: \"benny friedman of michigan play the quarterback position while edward l mcmillan of princeton play center.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see where each person is listed. The table has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. Each row corresponds to a specific position played by a player.\n\nStarting with Benny Friedman, according to the claim, he plays the quarterback position for Michigan. Looking at the table, I need to find the row where the name is \"benny friedman.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. ends: bennie oosterbaan mike tully - not him.\n2. tackles: ed weir ralph chase - nope.\n3. guards: carl diehl ed hess - no.\n4. center: edward l mcmillan - different name.\n5. quarterback: benny friedman - yes, this is the one.\n\nSo, Benny Friedman plays quarterback for Michigan. That part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNext, Edward L McMillan is said to play center for Princeton. Checking the table again:\n\nLooking at the row where the name is \"edward l mcmillan.\" The fifth row is center: edward l mcmillan - yes, his position is center and his school is Princeton. That matches.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. For Benny Friedman, he's in row 4 (index 4) under the column \"quarterback.\" For Edward L McMillan, he's in row 3 (index 3) under the column \"center.\"\n\nWait, no. Let me count the rows starting from 0:\n\n1. ends\n2. tackles\n3. guards\n4. center\n5. quarterback\n6. halfbacks\n7. fullback\n\nSo Benny Friedman is at row 4, and Edward L McMillan is at row 3.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 4, column \"quarterback\"\n- Row 3, column \"center\"\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each player's position and school in the table.

In the table, the \"guards\" row has the names Carl Diehl and Ed Hess under the name column, so that's correct. Their school is Dartmouth and Ohio State respectively, but their positions are both listed as guards.\n\nNext, checking if Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play the tackle position. Looking at the \"tackles\" row, the names are Ed Weir and Ralph Chase. Their schools are Nebraska and Pittsburgh, but their positions are both tackles. So that part seems correct too.\n\nNow, I need to make sure there's no inconsistency in their positions as per the table.

The claim states: \"ernie big dog nevers from stanford play the fullback position and andy swede oberlander red grange play the halfback position.\" \n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to verify if these two statements are accurate.\n\nThe table has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim about Ernie Big Dog Nevers:\n- His position is listed as fullback.\n- He attended Stanford.\n- The \"unanimous\" column says \"no.\"\n- In the college hall of fame, it's noted as \"nevers hof profile.\"\n\nSo, looking at the \"name\" and \"position\" columns: Yes, Ernie Big Dog Nevers plays the fullback position at Stanford.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table structure.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"oosterbaan tully both played tackle, and weir and chase play halfback.\" So there are two parts here. The first part says that Oosterbaan and Tully both played tackle. The second part says that Weir and Chase played halfback.\n\nNow, I'll refer to the table to verify each part. The table has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. Each row represents a player with their respective details.\n\nStarting with Oosterbaan and Tully as tackles. Looking through the rows:\n- Row 0: position is 'ends', so not tackle.\n- Row 1: position is 'tackles', names are Weir and Chase, not Oosterbaan or Tully.\n- Wait, I need to find if both Oosterbaan and Tully are listed as tackles. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking for 'oosterbaan' in the name column:\n- Row 0: bennie oosterbaan mike tully \u2014 position is 'ends', not tackle.\nSo, neither of them are listed as tackles here.\n\nWait a minute, that's conflicting with the claim. The first part says they both played tackle, but according to the table, their position is 'ends'. So that might make the entire claim false already, but let me check more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow 0: bennie oosterbaan mike tully are ends. So they didn't play tackle.\n\nLooking for 'tully' in names:\n- Only Row 0 has both Oosterbaan and Tully, as ends.\n\nSo the first part of the claim that Oosterbaan and Tully played tackle seems incorrect because their position is 'ends', not tackle.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 'oosterbaan hof profile no' refers to something else. Let me check the 'college hall of fame' column for both players. For Oosterbaan, it's 'oosterbaan hof profile no', and for Tully, it's part of that same row as ends.\n\nSo in any case, their positions are ends, not tackle. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: Weir and Chase play halfback. Looking at the table:\n- Row 1: position is 'tackles', names Weir and Chase. So they're tackles, not halfbacks.\nWait, but let me check all rows for halfbacks.\n\nLooking through each row's position column:\nRow 0: ends\nRow 1: tackles\nRow 2: guards\nRow 3: center\nRow 4: quarterback\nRow 5: halfbacks (names Swede and Oberlander)\nRow 6: fullback\n\nSo, Weir is in Row 1 as a tackle. Chase is also in Row 1 as a tackle. Therefore, the second part of the claim that Weir and Chase played halfback is false because they're listed as tackles.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The claim says \"weir and chase play halfback.\" But according to the table, their position is 'tackles', so they didn't play halfback. Therefore, both parts of the claim are false.\n\nBut wait, I might have missed something. Let me double-check each row for any mention of halfbacks:\n\nRow 5: halfbacks are Swede and Oberlander, not Weir or Chase.\n\nSo yes, the claim is incorrect on both counts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Oosterbaan and Tully played tackle and that Weir and Chase played halfback. However:\n- Both Oosterbaan and Tully are listed as 'ends', not tackles.\n- Weir and Chase are also listed as 'tackles', not halfbacks.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Friedman plays fullback.\n2. McMullin plays quarterback.\n\nNow, I'll need to check each part against the table provided. The table has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame.\n\nI think the best approach is to go through each position in the table and see if any of them match Friedman or McMullan in the 'name' column with the specified positions (fullback and quarterback).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In row 0 (ends), the name is \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully\". Doesn't mention Friedman or McMullan.\n- Row 1 (tackles): \"ed weir ralph chase\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2 (guards): \"carl diehl ed hess\" \u2013 no match.\n- Row 3 (center): \"edward l mcmillan\". Oh, here's McMullin. Position is center, not quarterback.\n- Row 4 (quarterback): \"benny friedman\". Friedman is listed as the quarterback here.

That doesn't match because he's a quarterback.\n- Row 5 (halfbacks): \"andy swede oberlander red grange\" \u2013 no relevant names.\n- Row 6 (fullback): \"ernie big dog nevers\". The name is Nevers, not Friedman or McMullan.\n\nSo, the claim says Friedman plays fullback. But in the table, Friedman is listed as a quarterback under the 'quarterback' row. That means he's not playing fullback. Additionally, McMullin is a center, so he's not a quarterback either. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nWait, let me double-check the names to make sure I didn't miss any spelling. Friedman is spelled as \"benny friedman\" and McMullin as \"edward l mcmillan\". The claim uses \"mcmillan play quarterback\", but in the table, he's a center, not a quarterback.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false because Friedman isn't a fullback and McMullin isn't a quarterback.

The claim says they played end, but according to the table, they were guards, not ends. That already seems contradictory.\n\nNext part of the claim: weir and chase play halfback. Looking at the table, under 'tackles', it lists ed weir ralph chase as tackles. Then, looking for 'halfbacks' row, it's andy swede oberlander red grange, with no mention of weir or chase there. So if I'm correct, that would mean weir and chase didn't play halfback but rather tackle.\n\nWait, but in the table, under 'tackles', they are listed as tackles. Halfbacks are a different position.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"weir and chase both attended Princeton, whereas Friedman attends Stanford.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a position in college football (like quarterback, halfback, etc.), with columns for name, school, unanimous consent, and college hall of fame. My task is to check if the claim matches the data correctly.\n\nLet's start by identifying the relevant parts of the claim. The claim mentions two players: Weir and Chase, both attending Princeton. Then it says Friedman attends Stanford. \n\nSo I need to find where these individuals are in the table and what their schools are listed as.\n\nLooking at the \"name\" column:\n\n- For \"Ed Weir\" (tackles row) and \"Ralph Chase\" (tackles row), check their respective schools.\n- Then, for \"Benny Friedman\" (quarterback row), check his school.\n\nLet me go through each relevant player:\n\n1. **Ed Weir**: In the tackles row, his name is listed as \"ed weir ralph chase.\" His school is Nebraska and Pittsburgh. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because there are two names here. Oh, looking closer, it's probably \"Ed Weir\" paired with Ralph Chase? Or maybe they both have their own entries? Let me check each row.\n\nWait, actually, the \"tackles\" row lists \"ed weir ralph chase\" as the name. So that might be a single entry combining two individuals. Maybe Ed Weir and Ralph Chase are from different schools. \n\nBut according to the table:\n\n- Ed Weir is listed under school as Nebraska and Pittsburgh? Or wait, no, each row has one school. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the \"school\" column for the tackles row: It says Nebraska and Pittsburgh. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because usually each person would have their own school. Maybe it's a typo or an error in the table? Or perhaps it's indicating both Ed Weir and Ralph Chase attended multiple schools. That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, no, actually looking back, I think each row is one person. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the structure, each row has one name, but sometimes two names are mentioned in the \"name\" column, like \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully.\" So perhaps the \"name\" field can have multiple names per row. But that complicates things.\n\nWait no, looking again, it's more likely that each row is a single player with details. For example:\n\n- The first row has position 'ends' and name 'bennie oosterbaan mike tully.' So maybe those two individuals are both ends players from Michigan and Dartmouth.\n\nBut then in the \"school\" column for that row, it's listed as Michigan and Dartmouth. That makes sense because each name probably belongs to a different player.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table, the \"name\" column sometimes lists multiple names, like 'ed weir ralph chase' under the tackles position. So perhaps each row is a single entry for a position with two players? Or maybe it's a formatting issue where each player has their own row but the name field includes both.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to parse each row properly.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Ends**: Name is 'bennie oosterbaan mike tully.' School: Michigan and Dartmouth.\n   - So, Bennie Oosterbaan from Michigan and Mike Tully from Dartmouth.\n\n2. **Tackles**: Name is 'ed weir ralph chase.' School: Nebraska and Pittsburgh.\n   - Ed Weir from Nebraska and Ralph Chase from Pittsburgh.\n\n3. **Guards**: Name is 'carl diehl ed hess.' School: Dartmouth and Ohio State.\n   - Carl Diehl from Dartmouth and Ed Hess from Ohio State.\n\n4. **Center**: Name is 'edward l mcmillan.' School: Princeton.\n   - Edward L. McMullin from Princeton.\n\n5. **Quarterback**: Name is 'benny friedman.' School: Michigan.\n   - Benny Friedman from Michigan.\n\n6. **Halfbacks**: Name is 'andy swede oberlander red grange.' School: Dartmouth and Illinois.\n   - Andy Swede from Dartmouth and Oberlander/Red Grange from Illinois.\n\n7. **Fullback**: Name is 'ernie big dog nevers.' School: Stanford.\n   - Ernie Big Dog Nevers from Stanford.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Weir and Chase both attended Princeton,\" but looking at their schools:\n\n- Ed Weir's school is Nebraska.\n- Ralph Chase's school is Pittsburgh.\nNeither went to Princeton. That's a problem for the claim.\n\nThen, the claim also says Friedman attends Stanford. But according to the table, Friedman is from Michigan (quarterback row).\n\nSo the claim seems incorrect on both counts: Weir and Chase didn't go to Princeton, and Friedman didn't attend Stanford; he went to Michigan.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Weir and Chase attended Princeton and Friedman attended Stanford.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"nevers from michigan play tackle with swede , and grange play fullback.\" This seems to be about two specific players\u2014probably named Nevers and Grange\u2014and their positions in the game, possibly involving others like Swede.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I see that each row represents a position (like ends, tackles, guards, etc.), with details about the player(s), their school, whether they were unanimously selected, and their college hall of fame status. My task is to check if the claim aligns with this data.\n\nLet me parse the claim sentence by sentence.\n\n1. \"nevers from michigan play tackle with swede\": So, Nevers (from Michigan) plays the tackle position, and does so alongside someone named Swede.\n\n2. \", and grange play fullback\": Grange also plays the fullback position.\n\nNow, I need to look through each row of the table to see if any players match these names and positions.\n\nStarting with the first part: Nevers from Michigan playing tackle. Let me scan each row for a player named Nevers who went to Michigan and is listed as a tackle.\n\nLooking at the \"tackles\" row (row index 1), I see players Ed Weir and Ralph Chase. The schools are Nebraska and Pittsburgh, respectively. No one named Nevers here. Moving on.\n\nNext, the \"guards\" row (row index 2) mentions Carl Diehl and Ed Hess from Dartmouth and Ohio State. Not relevant for tackle or Nevers.\n\nThe \"center\" row (row index 3) is Edward L. McMillan from Princeton. Nope.\n\nThe \"quarterback\" row (row index 4) is Benny Friedman from Michigan, but he's a quarterback, not a tackle.\n\nThe \"halfbacks\" row (row index 5) includes Andy Swede Oberlander and Red Grange from Dartmouth and Illinois. Swede is here as a halfback, not tackle.\n\nWait, the claim mentions Nevers playing tackle with Swede. So perhaps I'm looking for a tackle position where both Nevers and Swede are listed, but I don't see any mention of Swede in the tackle row.\n\nLooking back, maybe I missed something. Let's check each player:\n\n- In the \"tackles\" row: Ed Weir (Nebraska) and Ralph Chase (Pittsburgh). Neither is named Nevers or Swede.\n- \"Guards\" row has Carl Diehl and Ed Hess; no relevant names.\n- \"Center\": Edward L. McMillan, not relevant.\n- \"Quarterback\": Benny Friedman from Michigan; not tackle.\n- \"Halfbacks\": Andy Swede Oberlander (so Swede is here as a halfback) and Red Grange (from Dartmouth). So Swede is a halfback, not tackle.\n- \"Fullback\" row: Ernie Big Dog Nevers from Stanford. Oh wait! That's someone named Nevers, but he's a fullback, not tackle.\n\nWait, the claim says that Nevers plays tackle, but in the table, under fullback (row index 5), we have Ernie Big Dog Nevers as a fullback from Stanford. So there's a Nevers playing fullback, not tackle.\n\nAdditionally, Swede is mentioned as a halfback. The claim seems to suggest that Nevers and Swede are both playing tackle, which doesn't align with the data because:\n\n- There's no player named Nevers playing tackle.\n- Swede is listed as a halfback, not tackle.\n- The fullback row has Nevers, but he's from Stanford, not Michigan. Wait, the claim says \"nevers from michigan\"\u2014so that might be a red flag.\n\nIn the table, under the fullback row (row index 5), the player is Ernie Big Dog Nevers from Stanford. So he's not from Michigan. The claim states \"nevers from michigan,\" which doesn't match this data.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the second part of the claim: Grange plays fullback. Looking at the table, in the halfbacks row (row index 5), Red Grange is listed as a player from Dartmouth and Illinois, but he's a halfback, not a fullback. So Grange isn't playing fullback here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\n- The claim says \"nevers from michigan play tackle with swede , and grange play fullback.\"\n- In the table, under 'fullbacks' (row index 5), we have Ernie Big Dog Nevers as a fullback, but he's from Stanford, not Michigan. So that part doesn't fit.\n- There is no player named Nevers in the tackle row, and Swede is listed as a halfback.\n\nAdditionally, Red Grange is a halfback, not a fullback.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- The claim mentions that Nevers (from Michigan) plays tackle. But in the table:\n  - There's no player named Nevers who plays tackle.\n  - The only Nevers listed is as a fullback from Stanford, not Michigan.\n  \n- Also, Swede is a halfback, not tackle.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because:\n\n1. Nevers isn't playing tackle; he's a fullback from Stanford, not Michigan.\n2. Swede is a halfback, not tackle.\n3. Grange is a halfback, not fullback.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fullback\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"unanimous\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college hall of fame\"}\n]}",
