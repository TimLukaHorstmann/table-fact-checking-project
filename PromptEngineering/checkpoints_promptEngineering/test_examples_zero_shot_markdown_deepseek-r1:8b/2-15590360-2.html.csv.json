The claim says, \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns: class, season, race, podiums, and pole. Each row represents a different class with their respective statistics.\n\nThe specific claim is about the \"moto2\" class having 0 poles. So I should focus on the row where the class is moto2. Let me check each row:\n\n1. The first row is for \"125 cc\" from 2001, so that's not relevant.\n2. The second row is \"250 cc\" spanning seasons 2002-2008, which doesn't apply here.\n3. The third row is \"motogp\" in 2009, so not the target class.\n4. The fourth row is for \"moto2\" starting from 2010 onwards. Here, I need to check the pole column. It shows a value of 0.\n5. The fifth row is \"total\" since 2002, which is a summary but not directly about moto2.\n\nSo, looking at the \"pole\" column under the \"moto2\" class, it's indeed 0. Therefore, the claim is true because there are no poles in the moto2 class as per the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are 0 pole positions in the Moto2 class. Checking the table, under the Moto2 row, the pole column shows 0. This supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that there are 4 instances where a Moto2 class achieved a podium finish in the race. Wait, no, actually, reading it again: \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" Hmm, maybe I misread that. Pole position is when a rider starts first on the grid based on qualifying times. So perhaps the claim is about pole positions, not podiums.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a class with their season, race count, podiums, and poles. The Moto2 class started in 2010 and onwards, with 62 races, 4 podiums, and 0 poles. Wait, so if the claim is about pole positions, then looking for \"pole\" column.\n\nIn the table, under the 'moto2' row, the number of poles is 0. So there are no instances where a Moto2 rider took the pole in any race during those years. The total class also shows 0 poles across all its races from 2002 to present.\n\nThe claim says \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" If it's saying that there are 4 instances where a Moto2 class had a pole, but according to the table, it's 0. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that in Moto2 races, there were 4 podiums. But looking at the table, under 'podiums' for Moto2, it's 4.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim is \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" So maybe the claim is stating that in the context of poles (first positions), the Moto2 class achieved this 4 times. But according to the table, Moto2 has 0 poles. Alternatively, perhaps it's about podiums, and the number being 4.\n\nWait, the 'podiums' column for Moto2 is indeed 4. So maybe the claim is trying to say that there are 4 Moto2 class podiums, which is correct. But then why does it mention \"pole\"? Maybe a typo or misunderstanding in the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misphrased and actually refers to podium finishes, not poles. If so, then checking the 'podiums' column for Moto2 would be 4, which supports the claim if it's about podiums. But since the claim specifically says \"pole,\" that might make it false.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me parse the claim again: \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" So it's saying that in 4 instances, the Moto2 class achieved a pole (first position). From the table, under 'pole' for Moto2, it's 0. Therefore, the claim is false because there are no poles for Moto2.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting the wording. Maybe \"4 pole have\" refers to 4 instances where someone from the Moto2 class achieved a pole. But since the table shows 0, that would make the statement false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of races or something else. Let me check each relevant cell.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The 'pole' column for Moto2 is 0.\n- Total pole across all classes is also 0.\n\nSo if the claim is that there are 4 instances where a Moto2 rider got a pole, it's false because the table says 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Also, to check which cells are relevant: the 'pole' column and the specific class, which is 'moto2'. So in the table, row index 3 (Moto2) has the pole value as 0.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be for the Moto2 row's 'pole' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are 4 instances where a Moto2 class achieved a pole position. However, according to the table, the Moto2 class has 0 poles. This makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
