    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"selkirk - interlake be the rid for the candidate patricia cordner who gain 9506 vote.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what's being claimed.\n\n1. **Riding**: selkirk - interlake\n2. **Candidate**: Patricia Cordner\n3. **Action**: gained votes (specifically 9506)\n4. **Verification**: Need to check if this riding has this candidate with that number of votes.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the riding is \"selkirk - interlake\" and see if there's a candidate named Patricia Cordner. Once found, I should verify the votes and rank.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 0**: Riding: brandon-souris, Candidate: jean luc bouch\u00e9, Votes: 6055\n- **Row 1**: Riding: charleswood-st james-assiniboia, Candidate: fiona shiells, Votes: 7190\n- **Row 2**: Riding: churchill, Candidate: niki ashton, Votes: 8734\n- **Row 3**: Riding: dauphin-swan river-marquette, Candidate: ron strynadka, Votes: 4914\n- **Row 4**: Riding: elmwood-transcona, Candidate: jim maloway, Votes: 14355\n- **Row 5**: Riding: kildonan-st paul, Candidate: ross eadie, Votes: 12093\n- **Row 6**: Riding: portage-lisgar, Candidate: mohamed alli, Votes: 2353\n- **Row 7**: Riding: provencher, Candidate: ross c martin, Votes: 4947\n- **Row 8**: Riding: saint boniface, Candidate: matt schaubroeck, Votes: 5502\n- **Row 9**: Riding: selkirk-interlake, Candidate: patricia cordner, Votes: 9506\n- **Row 10**: Riding: winnipeg centre, Candidate: pat martin, Votes: 12285\n- **Row 11**: Riding: winnipeg north, Candidate: judy wasylycia - leis, Votes: 14097\n- **Row 12**: Riding: winnipeg south, Candidate: sean robert, Votes: 4673\n- **Row 13**: Riding: winnipeg south centre, Candidate: rachel heinrichs, Votes: 5490\n\nFrom this, I can see that in row 9 (index 9), the riding is \"selkirk-interlake\" and the candidate is Patricia Cordner. The votes for this cell are indeed 9506.\n\nNow, checking the claim: It states that selkirk - interlake is the riding for Patricia Cordner who gained 9506 votes. This matches exactly with row 9's data.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the rank column, she is ranked 2nd. However, the claim doesn't mention the rank, so it's not necessary to consider that for this particular check.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table as Patricia Cordner from selkirk - interlake has exactly 9506 votes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"votes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
