    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check the 'record' column for any fighters with a 5-3 record.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: res is win, record is 6-4. Not relevant.\nRow 1: res is loss, record is 5-4. Close but not 5-3.\nRow 2: res is loss, record is 5-3. This matches the claim.\nRow 3: res is win, record is 5-2. Doesn't match.\nRow 4: res is win, record is 4-2. No.\nRow 5: res is loss, record is 3-2. Nope.\nRow 6: nc, record is 3-1. Not relevant.\nRow 7: loss, record is 3-1. Again, not 5-3.\nRow 8: win, record is 3-0. No match.\nRow 9: win, record is 2-0. Nope.\nRow 10: win, record is 1-0. Doesn't fit.\n\nFrom this, I see only one fighter has a 5-3 record, which is in row 2 where the fighter is Dan Severn against Wes Sims with a submission in WeF 9. \n\nSo, the claim states that only one fighter has this record, and based on the table, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows only one fighter with a 5-3 record, fulfilling the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific fight record is TRUE or FALSE by examining the provided table. The claim states: \"when the opponent be dan severn , the method be submission (arm triangle choke) and the event be ufc japan : ultimate japan.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into three conditions:\n1. Opponent's name is Dan Severn.\n2. The method used was a submission via arm triangle choke.\n3. The event is \"ufc japan : ultimate japan.\"\n\nNext, I'll go through each row of the table to find any matches that satisfy all these conditions.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Opponent is Jonathan Ivoryy. Not Dan Severn. So, no match here.\n- Row 1: Opponent is Wes Sims. Again, not Dan Severn.\n- Row 2: Opponent is Dan Severn. This meets the first condition. Now check method and event.\n  - Method: Submission (arm triangle choke). Yes, that's a match.\n  - Event: It says \"wef 9 - world class.\" Not \"ufc japan : ultimate japan.\" So, the event doesn't match.\n\nMoving on:\n- Row 3: Opponent is Maurice Smith. Not Dan Severn.\n- Row 4: Opponent is Patrick Smith. Nope.\n- Row 5: Kazushi Sakuraba. Not Dan Severn.\n- Row 6: Same opponent as above. Doesn't apply.\n- Row 7: Maurice Smith again. No.\n- Row 8: Kazushi Sakuraba. Not Dan Severn.\n- Row 9: Carl Franks. Opponent is different.\n- Row 10: Victor Tatarkin. Opponent doesn't match.\n- Row 11: Gary Myers. Not Dan Severn.\n\nSo, only row 2 has the correct opponent but doesn't satisfy the event condition. The event there is \"wef 9 - world class,\" which isn't what the claim states. There are no other rows that meet all three criteria.\n\nSince none of the relevant cells match all parts of the claim, the statement must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires an opponent named Dan Severn with a specific method and event. Checking each row, only row 2 fits but doesn't match the event. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
