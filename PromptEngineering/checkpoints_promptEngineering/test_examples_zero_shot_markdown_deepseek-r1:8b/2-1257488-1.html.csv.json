    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim says: \"the match hold on january 26 , 2006 , the result be 2 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see if there's any row that matches January 26, 2006 as the date of the match. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the \"date\" column:\n- Row 1: June 7, 2000\n- Row 2: November 17, 2004\n- Row 3: November 17, 2004 (same as row 2)\n- Row 4: November 17, 2004 (again same as row 2 and 3)\n- Row 5: June 8, 2005\n- Row 6: September 7, 2005\n- Row 7: October 26, 2005\n- Row 8: January 26, 2006\n\nSo, only Row 8 has the date January 26, 2006. Now I need to check what the score and result are for that match.\n\nIn Row 8:\n- The \"score\" is listed as \"2 - 1\"\n- The \"result\" is also \"2 - 1\"\n\nWait, so both the score and result columns have \"2 - 1\". That seems to fully support the claim. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Since only Row 8 has the date matching, the relevant columns for that row would be \"date\" (row_index 8), \"score\", and \"result\".\n\nSo the JSON should include these three cells: date, score, result, each with their respective row indices.\n\nI think that's it. The claim is supported by Row 8 in all relevant columns.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",
