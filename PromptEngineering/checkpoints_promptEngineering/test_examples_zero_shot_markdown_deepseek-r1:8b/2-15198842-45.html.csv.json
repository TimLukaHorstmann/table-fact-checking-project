    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says, \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter, with a pick number of 19.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main points: one about the player's position and another about their draft pick number.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various rounds, picks, overall positions, names, positions, and colleges. My goal is to check if Corey Peters is listed as a defensive tackle with a pick number of 19.\n\nI'll start by finding Corey Peters in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Round 1: Sean Weatherspoon is a linebacker from Missouri.\n- Round 3: Corey Peters is a defensive tackle from Kentucky, picked at 19th overall.\n- Round 3: Mike Johnson is a guard from Alabama, but that's not relevant here since we're looking for a defensive tackle.\n- So on and so forth. The other entries are for different positions like guard, wide receiver, safety, etc.\n\nNow, focusing on Corey Peters, his position is listed as defensive tackle, which matches the claim. Next, I need to check his pick number. According to the table, he was picked in Round 3 with a pick number of 19.\n\nSo, the claim says \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter, with a pick number of 19.\" From the table, Corey Peters is indeed the only defensive tackle listed, and his pick number is 19. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for defensive tackles. Only Corey Peters matches that position and has a pick number of 19.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
