Since the claim is about funding by ST2, the relevant columns would be \"funded by st2.\" \n\nLooking at the row for \"redondo / star lake,\" under \"funded by st2,\" it's marked as \"no.\" That means the station isn't funded by ST2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the redondo/star lake station is not funded by ST2.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, I first locate the relevant row and column in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"Bellevue have a station propose at a hospital\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions that Bellevue has a proposed station located at a hospital.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a specific transit station with various details like name, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, and funded by st2. My goal is to find any entries related to Bellevue having a station specifically at a hospital.\n\nI'll go through the table row by row to see which ones mention Bellevue. Scanning each row:\n\n1. Boeing Access Road - Tukwila: Not Bellevue.\n2. Jackson Park - Shoreline: No.\n3. Shoreline - Shoreline: No.\n4. Mountlake Terrace - Mountlake Terrace: No.\n5. Lynnwood - Lynnwood: No.\n6. Alderwood - Alderwood Mall, Lynnwood: No.\n7. 164th / Ash Way - Lynnwood: No.\n8. Everett Station - Everett: No.\n9. Highline Community College - Des Moines: No.\n10. Redondo / Star Lake - Federal Way: No.\n11. Federal Way Transit Center - Federal Way: No.\n12. South Federal Way - Federal Way: No.\n13. Port of Tacoma / Fife - Fife: No.\n14. Rainier - Central District, Seattle: No.\n15. Mercer Island - Mercer Island: No.\n16. South Bellevue - Bellevue: Yes, this is a station in Bellevue.\n17. East Main - Bellevue: Yes, another one.\n18. Bellevue Transit Center - Downtown Bellevue: Yes.\n19. Hospital - Bellevue: Ah, here's one that says \"Hospital\" as the station name and it's located in Bellevue.\n20. 120th - Bellevue: No.\n21. 130th - Bellevue: No.\n22. Overlake Village - Overlake: No.\n23. Overlake Transit Center - Overlake: No.\n24. SE Redmond - Redmond: No.\n\nNow, focusing on the relevant rows for Bellevue. The row with \"Hospital\" is key here. It says \"Hospital\" as the station name and the city/neighborhood is Bellevue. This directly relates to the claim about a hospital having a proposed station in Bellevue. \n\nAdditionally, looking at other stations in Bellevue like South Bellevue and East Main, those don't specifically mention hospitals. The important one is the row labeled \"hospital\" which aligns with the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there's an entry that matches the criteria mentioned in the claim, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones for the \"Hospital\" station.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"station\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"1 park and ride haven't been proposed for overlake village.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any relevant information about \"overlake village\" related to park and ride. \n\nLooking at the table's columns, there's one called \"park and ride,\" which seems directly related to the claim. So I should focus on this column.\n\nNext, I'll scan each row for mentions of \"overlake village.\" The rows are as follows:\n\n- Row 16: overlake village\n- Row 17: overlake transit center\n\nNow, checking the \"park and ride\" column for these rows:\n\n- For row 16 (overlake village), the park and ride status is \"yes.\"\n- For row 17 (overlake transit center), it's also \"yes.\"\n\nWait, that seems contradictory.

But in the table, for overlake village, the park and ride is listed as \"yes.\" So that suggests a park and ride has been proposed.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because there's a \"park and ride\" noted for overlake village.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no park and ride has been proposed for Overlake Village.

So \"overlake village\" is indeed present, which means it's a relevant location to check.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"1 park and ride project propose.\" From the table, there are several columns that might be relevant here: \"park and ride,\" \"projected opening,\" etc. But since we're focusing on whether there's a proposal for a park and ride, I think the \"park and ride\" column is directly related.\n\nLooking at the row where station is \"overlake village,\" which is actually labeled as \"overlake village\" in the city/neighborhood column but the first row under that might be another entry.

Overlake Transit Center\n24. SE Redmond\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm getting confused because the initial markdown table might not have all these rows as separate entries. Let me re-examine the table.\n\nLooking back at the user's provided table:\n\nThe first few lines are:\n\n| station                    | extension             | city / neighborhood        | projected opening     | park and ride   | funded by st2    |\n\nThen the data starts with \"boeing access road\" as station, then \"jackson park,\" \"shoreline,\" etc., up to \"se redmond.\"\n\nNow, I'm looking for a row where the \"city / neighborhood\" is \"overlake village.\" Scanning through the list:\n\nLooking at the last few rows provided by the user, I see:\n\n1. hospital                   | east link             | bellevue                   | 2021                  | no              | yes              |\n2. 120th                      | east link             | bellevue                   | 2021                  | no              | yes              |\n3. 130th                      | east link             | bellevue                   | 2021                  | yes             | yes              |\n4. overlake village           | east link             | overlake                   | 2021                  | yes             | yes              |\n5. overlake transit center    | east link             | overlake                   | 2021                  | yes             | yes              |\n6. se redmond                 | east link             | redmond                    | unknown               | no              | no               |\n\nWait, so the row with \"overlake village\" is number 22 in this list, but looking at the user's table, it's actually listed as:\n\n22. overlake village           | east link             | overlake                   | 2021                  | yes             | yes              |\n23. overlake transit center    | east link             | overlake                   | 2021                  | yes             | yes              |\n\nSo the row where station is \"overlake village\" has city/neighborhood as \"overlake.\" Wait, no, the first column is station, so in this case:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- The rows are:\n\n1. Boeing Access Road\n2. Jackson Park\n3. Shoreline\n4. Mountlake Terrace\n5. Lynnwood\n6. Alderwood\n7. 164th / Ash Way\n8. Everett Station\n9. Highline Community College\n10. Redondo / Star Lake\n11.

Hospital\n20. 120th\n21. 130th\n22. Overlake Village\n23. Overlake Transit Center\n24. SE Redmond\n\nSo the row where station is \"overlake village\" (row 22) has city/neighborhood as \"overlake.\" Wait, but the claim says \"overlake village,\" which might not match exactly.\n\nWait, no: in the table, it's:\n\n| station                  | extension | city / neighborhood        | ... |\n|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------------| ... |\n| Overlake Village          | east link  | overlake                   | ... |\n\nSo the city/neighborhood is \"overlake,\" not \"overlake village.\" So perhaps there's a discrepancy.\n\nBut the claim refers to \"overlake village\" as the location, so maybe the station name is \"Overlake Transit Center\" in the table. Wait, no: let me clarify:\n\nIn row 22: station is Overlake Village, city/neighborhood is overlake.\n\nSo the row where the city/neighborhood is \"overlake village\" doesn't exist; instead, there's a station named Overlake Village with the city/neighborhood as \"overlake.\" Therefore, perhaps the claim is referring to that row, but the city name doesn't exactly match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the user's provided table, the rows are:\n\n1. Boeing Access Road\n2. Jackson Park\n3. Shoreline\n4. Mountlake Terrace\n5. Lynnwood\n6. Alderwood\n7. 164th / Ash Way\n8. Everett Station\n9. Highline Community College\n10. Redondo / Star Lake\n11. Federal Way Transit Center\n12. South Federal Way\n13. Port of Tacoma / Fife\n14. Rainier\n15. Mercer Island\n16. South Bellevue\n17. East Main\n18. Bellevue Transit Center\n19. Hospital\n20. 120th\n21. 130th\n22. Overlake Village\n23. Overlake Transit Center\n24. SE Redmond\n\nSo row 22 is \"Overlake Village,\" and the city/neighborhood is \"overlake.\" Therefore, perhaps the claim is referring to this station, but with a slightly different name.\n\nBut assuming that the user intended to refer to the correct row, I'll proceed.\n\nIn row 22, for Overlake Village:\n\n- park and ride: yes\n\nSo there is a park and ride at Overlake Village.\n\nNow, the claim says \"1 park and ride project propose.\" So perhaps it's referring to whether there was a proposal to add another park and ride, but in this case, the current status is \"yes,\" so maybe the user is asking if they proposed building more.\n\nBut according to the table, as of now, the park and ride exists. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that there is already a park and ride at Overlake Village, so no need for a proposal. But that depends on what exactly the claim is asking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about proposing additional ones, but based solely on the data provided, I can only confirm that there is an existing park and ride.\n\nGiven all this, to answer the question: Is there a proposed park and ride project at Overlake Village?\n\nFrom the table, the \"park and ride\" column says \"yes,\" so perhaps the proposal has already been implemented. Therefore, maybe the answer is no; they have one already.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is that they propose building another one, then it's unclear from the data provided.\n\nBut given the information, I can only say that there is a park and ride at Overlake Village.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, here is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: The task is to determine if a proposed park and ride project exists at Overlake Village. In the table, look for the row corresponding to \"Overlake Village.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row**: Upon examining the table, the station \"Overlake Village\" is found in row 22.\n\n3. **Check the \"park and ride\" Column**: For this row, the value under \"park and ride\" is \"yes,\" indicating that a park and ride facility exists at Overlake Village.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the existence of a park and ride is already confirmed, there is no need for an additional proposed project as per the current data provided.\n\n**Answer**: No, a park and ride is already present at Overlake Village, so no proposal is needed.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"overlake have a propose station of bellevue transit center , an extension of east link , and a propose parking and ride.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. Overlake has a proposed station named Bellevue Transit Center.\n2. This station is part of an extension of East Link.\n3. The station includes a propose parking and ride.\n\nLooking at the table provided, my goal is to find relevant rows that match these points.\n\nStarting with \"overlake\" and \"Bellevue Transit Center.\" I'll scan through each row in the table where the city or neighborhood might be Overlake. However, looking through the columns, I don't see an exact match for \"Overlake\" in the \"city / neighborhood\" column. The closest is \"overlake village\" and \"overlake transit center,\" but the main rows are under station names like \"se redmond\" etc.\n\nNext, checking if any row mentions \"Bellevue Transit Center.\" I find a row with this exact name: \"bellevue transit center.\" Its details show:\n\n- Station: bellevue transit center\n- extension: east link\n- city/neighborhood: downtown bellevue\n- projected opening: 2020\n- park and ride: no\n- funded by st2: yes\n\nSo, this station is indeed part of the East Link extension. But according to the table, it doesn't have a park and ride (park and ride is \"no\"). The claim mentions that there's a propose parking and ride. However, in the table, I don't see any row explicitly stating that Overlake has a proposed station at Bellevue Transit Center with an East Link extension and a park and ride.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is referring to Overlake (as in the village) having a station proposal related to Bellevue Transit Center. Let me check if any row mentions both \"overlake\" and \"Bellevue Transit Center.\" Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- overlake transit center is under city/neighborhood: overlake\n- bellevue transit center is under city/neighborhood: downtown bellevue\n\nSo Overlake village does have a station called \"overlake transit center,\" but that's in the \"east link\" and has a park and ride. However, the claim mentions \"bellevue transit center,\" which is in downtown Bellevue.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- The claim says Overlake has a proposed station named Bellevue Transit Center.\n- In the table, there's a row for \"Bellevue Transit Center\" with extension East Link and park and ride \"no.\"\n- Also, \"Overlake Transit Center\" is in Overlake village under east link, with park and ride \"yes.\"\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because the station in Bellevue doesn't have a park and ride. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the locations.\n\nWait, the claim says Overlake has a propose station at Bellevue Transit Center. But the table shows that the station named Bellevue Transit Center is not in Overlake\u2014it's in downtown Bellevue. So perhaps there's confusion between Overlake and Bellevue locations.\n\nAdditionally, according to the table, \"Bellevue Transit Center\" doesn't have a park and ride, while the claim says it does (or proposes to). Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because either the station is not in Overlake or it lacks the proposed parking.\n\nI'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to check if any other row refers to Overlake having a proposed Bellevue Transit Center. Scanning through, \"overlake transit center\" is a separate entry. So perhaps there's no such thing as Overlake proposing a station at Bellevue Transit Center.\n\nThus, the claim seems to be incorrect because the relevant rows don't support all parts of it. Specifically, the parking and ride status might not align.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Overlake has a proposed station named Bellevue Transit Center with an East Link extension and a proposed park and ride. Upon examining the table:\n\n- There is no row for \"Bellevue Transit Center\" in Overlake; instead, it's located in downtown Bellevue.\n- The \"Bellevue Transit Center\" does not have a park and ride.\n- Overlake has its own transit center with East Link and a park and ride.\n\nSince the claim inaccurately places the station in Overlake and misrepresents the park and ride status, it is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"station\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"extension\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"1 neighborhood doesn't have station propose at a hospital.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that there's one neighborhood where no station is proposed near a hospital. So I need to look for neighborhoods in the table that have a station but are not associated with any hospital.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: station, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, funded by st2. The relevant columns for this claim would probably be \"city / neighborhood\" and maybe \"station,\" but more importantly, perhaps \"park and ride\" or another indicator related to hospitals.\n\nWait, actually, the table doesn't have a column explicitly mentioning hospitals. So I might need to look at the \"city/neighborhood\" and see if any of them are associated with a hospital in their name, like \"hospital\" or similar terms, but looking through the list:\n\nI see entries like:\n- bellevue\n- central district\n- des moines\n- downtown bellevue\n- fife\n- lynnwood\n- mercer island\n- redmond\n- seattle\n- tacoma\n\nWait, none of these have \"hospital\" in their name. So maybe the claim is referring to a neighborhood where a station is not proposed at all near a hospital.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about neighborhoods that don't have any stations related to hospitals. But without a specific column for hospitals, I might need to infer based on other data.\n\nWait, maybe \"hospital\" isn't mentioned, but the claim could be about a neighborhood where a station is not proposed in relation to a hospital. So I should look at each row and see if the neighborhood has a station that's related to a hospital.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For example, bellevue has several entries: east main, bellevue transit center, hospital, 120th, 130th, overlake village, overlake transit center. The \"hospital\" row has a station called \"east link,\" but under park and ride it says \"no.\" So does that mean no park and ride at the hospital station? Or maybe no station is proposed near the hospital?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nEach row represents a station, its extension, the city/neighborhood it's in, when it's projected to open, whether there's a park and ride, and if it's funded by ST2.\n\nSo for example, the \"hospital\" row has:\n- station: hospital\n- extension: east link\n- city/neighborhood: bellevue\n- projected opening: 2021\n- park and ride: no\n- funded by st2: yes\n\nSo this is a proposed station in bellevue called \"hospital,\" but it doesn't have a park and ride. The claim says that one neighborhood doesn't have a station propose at a hospital. Wait, maybe the wording is off. Perhaps it's saying that one neighborhood lacks a proposed station related to a hospital.\n\nIn this case, the \"hospital\" row is in bellevue. It has a station but no park and ride. So does that mean there's no proposal for a station at the hospital? Or is the station still being proposed?\n\nWait, the claim says \"doesn't have station propose at a hospital.\" Maybe it's implying that one neighborhood doesn't have a proposed station near its hospital.\n\nLooking back, bellevue has several stations: east main (no park and ride), bellevue transit center (no park and ride), hospital (no park and ride), 120th (no), 130th (yes), overlake village (yes), and overlake transit center (yes).\n\nSo in the case of the \"hospital\" station, it's in bellevue but has no park and ride. The claim is that one neighborhood doesn't have a proposed station at a hospital.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about having a station near a hospital. If the station is located near the hospital, then it would be relevant. But without knowing where exactly the hospitals are, maybe we need to look for a station in a neighborhood where a hospital is present but no station is proposed there.\n\nAlternatively, the claim might be saying that one neighborhood lacks a station propose at a hospital, meaning that despite having a hospital, there's no proposed station.\n\nBut looking through the table, I don't see any hospitals listed as part of the city/neighborhood column. So perhaps the relevant cells are those where the \"city / neighborhood\" includes a term like \"hospital,\" but I don't see such an entry.\n\nWait, in the row for hospital:\n- station: hospital\n- city/neighborhood: bellevue\n\nSo maybe bellevue has a station called \"hospital.\" But perhaps it's not proposed. Wait, the projected opening is 2021, so it's actually proposed and under construction. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says that in one neighborhood, there's no proposal for a station at a hospital. Maybe in bellevue, even though they have several stations, none of them are near the hospital, or perhaps the hospital isn't served by any station.\n\nWait, but without knowing where the hospitals are located relative to these neighborhoods, it's hard to say. However, looking at the table, I see a row for \"hospital\" in bellevue with a station called \"east link,\" but it has no park and ride. So maybe that implies there's no proposed station at the hospital itself.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about a neighborhood that doesn't have a station that serves its local hospital. In that case, if bellevue has multiple stations but none specifically near the hospital (or none named after the hospital), then maybe the \"hospital\" station isn't actually serving the hospital.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Maybe I need to focus on specific data points in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- The \"hospital\" row: station name is \"hospital,\" which might indicate it's near or related to a hospital, but it lacks a park and ride.\n- Other rows don't mention hospitals.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is that one neighborhood (bellevue) doesn't have a station propose at its hospital. So the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The row for \"hospital\" in bellevue, which has a station proposed but no park and ride.\n2. Maybe other stations in bellevue that don't serve the hospital.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about the absence of a specific type of station (like park and ride) at a hospital, implying it's not proposed there.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the relevant cell is the \"park and ride\" column for the \"hospital\" station, which is \"no.\" So that might indicate that no park and ride is proposed, hence no station is proposed at the hospital in bellevue.\n\nTherefore, the neighborhood in question would be bellevue, specifically the \"hospital\" station, where no park and ride is proposed, meaning perhaps no station is being built there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about other aspects like funding. Since it's funded by ST2, but without a park and ride, it might not be serving the hospital.\n\nSo, putting this together, I think the relevant rows are those in bellevue, particularly the \"hospital\" entry, as it relates to a station propose at a hospital location.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that one neighborhood lacks a proposed station near its hospital. The relevant data points in the table indicate that in bellevue, there's a station named \"hospital\" with a projected opening of 2021 and funding by ST2, but it does not have a park and ride. This absence of a park and ride facility might imply that no station is proposed at the hospital itself.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe neighborhood of bellevue has a station named \"hospital\" that lacks a park and ride, indicating no proposed station at the hospital. Thus, one such neighborhood exists as described in the claim.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is about the SE Redmond station being funded by ST2. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table.\n\nFirst, I should look for the row that corresponds to \"SE Redmond\" in the \"station\" column. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Boeing Access Road\n2. Jackson Park\n3. Shoreline\n4. Mountlake Terrace\n5. Lynnwood\n6. Alderwood\n7. 164th / Ash Way\n8. Everett Station\n9. Highline Community College\n10. Redondo / Star Lake\n11. Federal Way Transit Center\n12. South Federal Way\n13. Port of Tacoma / Fife\n14. Rainier\n15. Mercer Island\n16. South Bellevue\n17. East Main\n18. Bellevue Transit Center\n19. Hospital\n20. 120th\n21. 130th\n22. Overlake Village\n23. Overlake Transit Center\n24. SE Redmond\n\nSo, the SE Redmond station is in row 24. Now, I need to check which columns are relevant to verify the claim. The claim is about funding, so I should look at the \"funded by st2\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, for each row, the \"funded by st2\" status is either \"yes\" or \"no\". For SE Redmond (row 24), what's the value? Looking back, row 24 says:\n\n| se redmond                 | east link             | redmond                    | unknown               | no              | no               |\n\nSo in this row, under \"funded by st2\", it's marked as \"no\". That means the claim that SE Redmond is funded by ST2 is incorrect because the table shows it's not funded.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The station name is in the first column for each row, so row 24, column 1: \"station\" is \"se redmond\". Also, the funding status is in the fifth column (column index might be higher, but according to the table, it's the fifth cell). So I need to include both these cells as relevant.\n\nWait, let me double-check the columns:\n\nThe table has columns:\n1. station\n2. extension\n3. city / neighborhood\n4. projected opening\n5. park and ride\n6. funded by st2\n\nSo for row 24, the \"station\" is SE Redmond (column 1), and \"funded by st2\" is column 6. So I need to include both these columns as relevant.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be FALSE because the funding status for SE Redmond is not yes. The relevant cells are row 24, column 1 (station) and row 24, column 6 (funded by st2).\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the SE Redmond station be funded by ST2\" is **FALSE** based on the table provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"station\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"funded by st2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
