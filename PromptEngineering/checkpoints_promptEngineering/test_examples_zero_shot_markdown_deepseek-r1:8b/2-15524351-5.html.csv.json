    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the lowest attendance figure in a game be 6500\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the lowest number of attendees at any game listed in the table is exactly 6,500. So my task is to look through each attendance figure and identify the smallest one, then check if it matches 6,500.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are multiple rows, each with a date, opponent, location, result, and attendance numbers. My focus should be on the \"attendance\" column to find the minimum value.\n\nLet me list out all the attendance figures from each row:\n\n1. 17,000\n2. 20,175\n3. 66,266\n4. 15,000\n5. 25,000\n6. 27,000\n7. 16,000\n8. 38,689\n9. 18,025\n10. 18,000\n11. 65,000\n\nNow, I'll go through each number to find the smallest one. Starting from the top:\n\n- The first is 17,000.\n- Next is 20,175, which is higher than 17k.\n- Then comes 66,266, way larger.\n- 15,000 is less than 17k but still higher than others we'll see.\n- 25k and 27k are both higher.\n- 16k is lower than 17k.\n- Next, 38k is much higher.\n- 18k is lower than 16k? Wait no, 18k is more than 16k. So 16k is still the lowest so far.\n- Then, 38k again.\n- 18,025 is just under 18k.\n- 18,000 is slightly less than that.\n- Finally, 65,000 and 6,500.\n\nWait, in row 11, it's listed as 6500 without a comma. So that's 6,500. Now, comparing all the numbers: 17k, 20k, 66k, 15k, 25k, 27k, 16k, 38k, 18k, 18k, and then 6,500.\n\nLooking for the smallest number here, I see 6,500 is much lower than all others. So that's the lowest attendance figure in the table.\n\nNow, checking if it's exactly 6,500 as stated in the claim. Yes, row 11 has an attendance of 6,500. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the lowest figure is indeed 6500.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attendance at any game listed is 6,500. By examining each attendance number in the table, we find that 6,500 is present in the last row, making it the minimum attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the demon deacon win 2 game and lose 9",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the demon deacon win 2 game and lose 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"demon deacon\" probably refers to Wake Forest University's Demon Deacons football team. The claim states that they won 2 games and lost 9. So I need to look through the table to see their game results over time.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. I should filter this data to only include games where the Demon Deacons are playing away or home, but maybe that's not necessary because the table doesn't specify which team is the home team. Wait, actually, in college football, typically the away team is denoted with a visit to the opponent's stadium. So for example, when North Carolina State is visiting Winston-Salem, it's likely they are the away team.\n\nSo I need to check each game result and see if Wake Forest (Demon Deacons) have 2 wins and 9 losses in total. Wait, but looking at the opponents: Davidson, SMU, 5 Tennessee (which I think is a typo for Tennessee?), Maryland, North Carolina State, North Carolina, Clemson, South Carolina, Duke, Virginia, and Virginia Tech.\n\nI don't know all the opponents off the top of my head, but let's check each result where Wake Forest might be playing as the home team or away. Hmm, actually, in the table, the location is specified, so I can check for wins and losses based on that.\n\nWait, no, the result is either a win (w) or loss (l), followed by scores. So let's go through each row:\n\n1. 09/09/1972 vs Davidson: Result l 10-56. That's a loss.\n2. 09/16/1972 vs SMU: Result l 10-56. Loss.\n3. 09/23/1972 vs 5 Tennessee: l 6-45. Loss.\n4. 10/07/1972 vs Maryland: l 0-23. Loss.\n5. 10/14/1972 vs North Carolina State: l 13-42. Loss.\n6. 10/21/1972 vs North Carolina: l 0-21. Loss.\n7. 10/28/1972 vs Clemson: l 0-31. Loss.\n8. 11/04/1972 vs South Carolina: l 3-35. Loss.\n9. 11/11/1972 vs Duke: w 9-7. That's a win.\n10. 11/18/1972 vs Virginia: l 12-15. Loss.\n11. 11/25/1972 vs Virginia Tech: l 9-44. Loss.\n\nSo, in the table, the Demon Deacons have only one win (against Duke) and ten losses. Wait, that's 1 win and 10 losses based on this data. But the claim says they won 2 games and lost 9. That doesn't match because there's only 1 win and more than 9 losses.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rows. The first row is a loss, second a loss, third a loss, fourth a loss, fifth a loss, sixth a loss, seventh a loss, eighth a loss, ninth a win, tenth a loss, eleventh a loss.\n\nSo that's 1 win and 11 games played (since 11 rows). Wait, no, the attendance numbers go from 17000 to 6500. So each row is a game they played in September through November. So total of 11 games: 1 win and 10 losses. But the claim says \"lose 9,\" which would mean they lost nine times, but here it's ten. Wait, no, the claim is 2 wins and 9 losses.\n\nWait, in 11 games, if they have 2 wins, that means 9 losses (because 2 + 9 = 11). But according to the table, they only have 1 win and 10 losses, which doesn't add up. So either I'm miscounting or there's a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: l\nRow 1: l\nRow 2: l\nRow3: l\nRow4: l\nRow5: l\nRow6: l\nRow7: l\nRow8: w\nRow9: l\nRow10: l\n\nThat's indeed 11 games. So 1 win and 10 losses. But the claim is 2 wins, 9 losses.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the Demon Deacons are not the only team in some of these matchups. For example, when they play Davidson, Davidson might be the home team, but that's Wake Forest's opponent, so it's a loss for them.\n\nBut looking at the opponents, Wake Forest is playing against Davidson (probably away), SMU (away), 5 Tennessee (away), Maryland (away), North Carolina State (away), North Carolina (away), Clemson (away), South Carolina (away), Duke (away), Virginia (away), and Virginia Tech (away). Wait, no, in the table, each row shows the opponent, so if Wake Forest is playing away, their location would be the opponent's stadium. For example, when Davidson is listed as the opponent, they are at home, so Wake Forest is the visitor.\n\nBut regardless of home or away, the result is for Wake Forest. So in all these 11 games, Wake Forest has 1 win and 10 losses.\n\nSo if the claim says they won 2 and lost 9, that's false because they only have 1 win and more than 9 losses (actually 10).\n\nWait, but wait: 1 win and 10 losses is a total of 11 games. The claim is 2 wins and 9 losses, which would be 11 games as well. So the issue is whether they have exactly 2 wins or 1.\n\nFrom the table, it's only 1 win. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Demon Deacons won 2 games and lost 9 based on the provided data. Upon analyzing each game result in the table, the Demon Deacons actually achieved only 1 win against Duke and a total of 10 losses. This does not align with the claim, thus making it false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The claim is incorrect; the Demon Deacons won only one game.}}",

    "claim": "the deacon be shutout 3 time during the season",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the deacon be shutout 3 time during the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of this claim means.\n\nFirst, \"deacon\" likely refers to Wake Forest University's football team because they are sometimes called Deacons. A \"shutout\" in sports terms means that one team scores zero points while the other scores. So the claim is saying that the Wake Forest Deacons were shut out three times during their season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game against a specific opponent on a particular date. The columns include date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The \"result\" column shows the score in the format like \"w 26 - 20\", which I think stands for Wake Forest winning by 26 points to 20. If it's a loss, it starts with an \"l\". So, for example, \"l 10 - 56\" means Wake Forest lost and scored 10 points while their opponent scored 56.\n\nSo to find out if the Deacons were shut out three times, I need to look through each game result and see how many times the Deacons scored zero points (i.e., they lost with a score of 0- something). \n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **09/09/1972 vs Davidson**: Result is \"w 26 - 20\". So Wake Forest won, scoring 26 and Davidson scored 20. Not a shutout.\n2. **09/16/1972 vs SMU**: Result is \"l 10 - 56\". Here, the Deacons lost (as indicated by 'l'), and their score is 10, while SMU scored 56. So they didn't score zero; it's a loss but not a shutout.\n3. **09/23/1972 vs 5 Tennessee**: Result is \"l 6 - 45\". Again, a loss, but the Deacons scored 6 points. Not a shutout.\n4. **10/07/1972 vs Maryland**: Result is \"l 0 - 23\". Here, the score is 0-23 in favor of Wake Forest? Wait, no, that's the opponent's score against them. So if it's l 0 - 23, does that mean Wake Forest lost and scored zero? Yes. That's a shutout for the Deacons because they didn't score any points.\n5. **10/14/1972 vs North Carolina State**: Result is \"l 13 - 42\". They lost, but scored 13 points. Not a shutout.\n6. **10/21/1972 vs North Carolina**: Result is \"l 0 - 21\". So here again, the Deacons lost and scored zero points. That's another shutout.\n7. **10/28/1972 vs Clemson**: Result is \"l 0 - 31\". Another loss with zero points scored by Wake Forest. Third shutout.\n8. **11/04/1972 vs South Carolina**: Result is \"l 3 - 35\". They lost, but scored 3 points. Not a shutout.\n9. **11/11/1972 vs Duke**: Result is \"w 9 - 7\". They won this game, so not a shutout.\n10. **11/18/1972 vs Virginia**: Result is \"l 12 - 15\". Lost, but scored 12 points. Not a shutout.\n11. **11/25/1972 vs Virginia Tech**: Result is \"l 9 - 44\". They lost and scored 9 points. Not a shutout.\n\nSo from the table, I can see that in three games: 10/07, 10/21, and 10/28, Wake Forest scored zero points. That's three instances where they were shut out. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on these results.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if \"l 0 - x\" always means that the Deacons scored zero or if it's indicating something else. Looking at another example, like 09/16: l 10 - 56, so the Deacons scored 10 points in a loss. So yes, when it starts with 'l' and the first number is zero, they didn't score any points.\n\nTherefore, there are three games where Wake Forest was shut out during the season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Deacons were shut out three times. From the table analysis, there are indeed three games where the Deacons scored 0 points (10/07, 10/21, and 10/28), indicating three shutouts.\n\n**Answer: TRUE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"7 of the game be play in north carolina\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that 7 games were played in North Carolina. So, I need to check each game's location and count how many times \"north carolina\" appears there.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The relevant column here is the \"location\" because that's where the games took place. I'll focus on that column.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. 09/09/1972: Location is \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\". This mentions North Carolina (nc), so this counts as one game in NC.\n2. 09/16/1972: Located in \"texas stadium irving, tx\" \u2013 not NC.\n3. 09/23/1972: \"neyland stadium knoxville, tn\" \u2013 Tennessee, not NC.\n4. 10/07/1972: \"byrd stadium college park, md\" \u2013 Maryland, nope.\n5. 10/14/1972: Back to \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\". That's another one in NC.\n6. 10/21/1972: Again, \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\". Third game in NC.\n7. 10/28/1972: Same location as before \u2013 groves stadium, NC. Fourth game here.\n8. 11/04/1972: Located at \"williams - brice stadium columbia, sc\" \u2013 South Carolina, not NC.\n9. 11/11/1972: At \"wallace wade stadium durham, nc\". That's another in North Carolina. Fifth game.\n10. 11/18/1972: Back to groves stadium, NC. Sixth game there.\n11. 11/25/1972: Groves stadium again \u2013 seventh game in NC.\n\nSo, counting them up, that's seven games played in North Carolina:\n\n- September 9\n- October 14\n- October 21\n- October 28\n- November 11\n- November 18\n- November 25\n\nThat makes seven instances where the location is North Carolina. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on these games.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any rows or miscount. Let me recount:\n\n1. Row 0: NC \u2013 yes\n2. Row 5: NC \u2013 yes (second)\n3. Row 6: NC \u2013 yes (third)\n4. Row 7: NC \u2013 yes (fourth)\n5. Row 8: SC \u2013 no\n6. Row 9: NC \u2013 yes (fifth)\n7. Row 10: NC \u2013 yes (sixth)\n8.

    "claim": "the most point score by a team in 1 game be 56",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"the most point score by a team in 1 game be 56\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. I need to carefully check each condition against the table and identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that there was a game where a team scored 56 points, and this is the highest point score by any team in a single game according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The 'result' column seems important here because it likely contains the scores of both teams for each game. Specifically, the format is something like \"w 26 - 20\" or \"l 10 - 56\". The first character after the letter indicates whether it's a win ('w') or loss ('l'). The numbers following that are the scores.\n\nSo, my main focus should be on the 'result' column. I need to extract the maximum score from any team in a single game and see if it's 56. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 09/09/1972 vs Davidson: Result is w 26 - 20. So, the highest score here is 26.\n2. 09/16/1972 vs SMU: Result is l 10 - 56. Here, the opponent scored 56 points on this team's loss. So, in this game, the opponent (SMU) scored 56, which would be the highest score for that game.\n3. 09/23/1972 vs 5 Tennessee: Result is l 6 - 45. The opponent scored 45 here.\n4. 10/07/1972 vs Maryland: Result is l 0 - 23. Opponent scored 23.\n5. 10/14/1972 vs North Carolina State: Result is l 13 - 42. Opponent scored 42.\n6. 10/21/1972 vs North Carolina: Result is l 0 - 21. Opponent scored 21.\n7. 10/28/1972 vs Clemson: Result is l 0 - 31. Opponent scored 31.\n8. 11/04/1972 vs South Carolina: Result is l 3 - 35. Opponent scored 35.\n9. 11/11/1972 vs Duke: Result is w 9 - 7. This team scored 9, opponent scored 7. So, the highest here is 9.\n10. 11/18/1972 vs Virginia: Result is l 12 - 15. Opponent scored 15.\n11. 11/25/1972 vs Virginia Tech: Result is l 9 - 44. Opponent scored 44.\n\nFrom this, the highest score in any game by a team is 56, which occurred on September 16, 1972 against SMU. So, the claim that \"the most point score by a team in 1 game be 56\" seems to be supported by the table.\n\nHowever, I should verify if there are multiple games with this score or only one. From the table, it appears there's only one such game where the opponent scored 56 points against SMU. The claim doesn't specify which team, just that a team scored 56 in a single game. Since the table shows that at least one game meets this criterion, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to identify which specific cells contain data that supports the claim. Specifically, the 'result' column for the row where the opponent scored 56 points, as that's the maximum. That would be the second row (index 1), and the column is 'result'.\n</think>\n\nThe highest score in a single game was indeed 56 points by the opponent against SMU on September 16, 1972.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the game with an attendance of 6500 be the fourth lowest attendance.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to understand its structure. The table has several columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different game with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions an attendance of 6500 being the fourth lowest. So, my main goal is to find out which rows have attendances lower than or equal to 6500 and then check their order to see if 6500 falls as the fourth one from the bottom.\n\nI'll start by listing all the attendance numbers from the table:\n\n- 17000\n- 20175\n- 66266\n- 15000\n- 25000\n- 27000\n- 16000\n- 38689\n- 18025\n- 18000\n- 6500\n\nNow, I'll sort these attendance numbers in ascending order to see their rankings. Lower numbers mean lower attendances.\n\nLet me list them out sorted from lowest to highest:\n\n1. 6500 (this is the one we're focusing on)\n2. 15000\n3. 16000\n4. 18000\n5. 18025\n6. 20175\n7. 25000\n8. 27000\n9. 38689\n10. 66266\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me recount all the attendances again to make sure I didn't skip any:\n\nFrom the table:\n17000, 20175, 66266, 15000, 25000, 27000, 16000, 38689, 18025, 18000, 6500.\n\nSo that's 11 games in total. Now sorting them properly:\n\nThe smallest is 6500, followed by 15000, then 16000, next is 18000, then 18025, then 20175, then 25000, then 27000, 38689, and the largest is 66266.\n\nWait, that's only 10 numbers. Oh no, I missed one: 17000. So adding that in:\n\nSorted attendances:\n6500 (1st), 15000 (2nd), 16000 (3rd), 18000 (4th), 18025 (5th), 20175 (6th), 25000 (7th), 27000 (8th), 38689 (9th), 17000 (10th), 66266 (11th).\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I list them again:\n\nFrom the table:\n6500,\n15000,\n16000,\n18000,\n18025,\n20175,\n25000,\n27000,\n38689,\n17000,\n66266.\n\nWhen sorted correctly, it's 6500, 15000, 16000, 17000, 18000, 18025, 20175, 25000, 27000, 38689, 66266. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier by including 17000 out of place.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\nThe correct sorted list from lowest to highest attendance would be:\n1. 6500\n2. 15000\n3. 16000\n4. 17000\n5. 18000\n6. 18025\n7. 20175\n8. 25000\n9. 27000\n10. 38689\n11. 66266\n\nWait, but in the original table, there's a row with attendance 15000 and another with 17000, then 16000, 18000, etc.\n\nSo, if I arrange them correctly:\n\n1. 6500\n2. 15000\n3. 16000\n4. 17000\n5. 18000\n6. 18025\n7. 20175\n8. 25000\n9. 27000\n10. 38689\n11. 66266\n\nSo, the attendance of 6500 is indeed the lowest with 1st place.\n\nBut the claim says it's the fourth lowest. Wait, that doesn't align. Because if the lowest is first, then the second lowest would be next, and so on. So, to find the fourth lowest, we need to look at the four highest attendances? No, wait, no\u2014lowest attendance means lower numbers are worse.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen someone refers to \"the lowest attendance,\" they mean the smallest number of people attending a game. The \"fourth lowest\" would mean the fourth smallest attendance number.\n\nSo in this case, the attendances sorted from lowest (1st) to highest (11th) are as I listed above. So the 4th lowest attendance is 17000 because:\n\n1. 6500\n2. 15000\n3. 16000\n4. 17000\n\nTherefore, the game with 6500 has the LOWEST attendance, not the fourth lowest.\n\nSo the claim says that the game with 6500 is the fourth lowest, but in reality, it's actually the first (lowest). So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to examine the 'attendance' column. The claim states that a game with attendance of 6500 is the fourth lowest. \n\nFirst, we list all attendances:\n- 17000\n- 20175\n- 66266\n- 15000\n- 25000\n- 27000\n- 16000\n- 38689\n- 18025\n- 18000\n- 6500\n\nSorting these from lowest to highest attendance:\n1. 6500\n2. 15000\n3. 16000\n4. 17000\n5. 18000\n6. 18025\n7. 20175\n8. 25000\n9. 27000\n10. 38689\n11. 66266\n\nThe game with attendance 6500 is the first lowest, not the fourth. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the demon deacon win as many game as they lose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim. It seems like it's saying that the Demon Deacons (which I believe is a nickname for Wake Forest's sports teams) have won as many games as they've lost in their season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The 'result' column shows whether they won (w) or lost (l) each game, along with the score. My goal is to count how many times they won and how many times they lost based on this table.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. 09/09/1972 vs Davidson: Result is w 26-20 \u2192 Win\n2. 09/16/1972 vs SMU: Result is l 10-56 \u2192 Loss\n3. 09/23/1972 vs 5 Tennessee: Result is l 6-45 \u2192 Loss\n4. 10/07/1972 vs Maryland: Result is l 0-23 \u2192 Loss\n5. 10/14/1972 vs North Carolina State: Result is l 13-42 \u2192 Loss\n6. 10/21/1972 vs North Carolina: Result is l 0-21 \u2192 Loss\n7. 10/28/1972 vs Clemson: Result is l 0-31 \u2192 Loss\n8. 11/04/1972 vs South Carolina: Result is l 3-35 \u2192 Loss\n9. 11/11/1972 vs Duke: Result is w 9-7 \u2192 Win\n10. 11/18/1972 vs Virginia: Result is l 12-15 \u2192 Loss\n11. 11/25/1972 vs Virginia Tech: Result is l 9-44 \u2192 Loss\n\nNow, I'll count the number of wins and losses.\n\nWins: Rows 0 (09/09) and 8 (11/11) \u2192 Total of 2 wins.\nLosses: The rest are losses. From row 1 to 7, and rows 9 to 10, 11? Wait, no, let me recount:\n\nFrom the list above, each game is a loss except for two. So total games played are 12 (from 0 to 11). Wins are 2, so losses would be 10.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, there are 11 games listed. Wait, no, the first date is 09/09, then each week, up to 11/25, which is 11 rows. So total of 12 games? Let me check: September has 4 weeks (4 entries?), October has 5, November has 3. Wait, actually, looking at the dates:\n\n- September: 9/9, 9/16, 9/23 \u2192 three games\n- October: 10/7, 10/14, 10/21, 10/28 \u2192 four games\n- November: 11/4, 11/11, 11/18, 11/25 \u2192 four games. Wait, but the table shows up to row 11 (11/25). So that's 3+4+4=11 rows? Or is it 12?\n\nWait, let me count:\n\n1. 09 / 09 \u2192 0\n2. 09 /16 \u21921\n3.09/23\u21922\n4.10/07\u21923\n5.10/14\u21924\n6.10/21\u21925\n7.10/28\u21926\n8.11/04\u21927\n9.11/11\u21928\n10.11/18\u21929\n11.11/25\u219210\n\nWait, the table starts with index 0 as 09/09, so it's row 0 to row 10, making 11 games in total.\n\nIn that case, Wins: rows 0 and 8 \u2192 2 wins.\nLosses: 11-2=9 losses.\n\nSo, according to the table, the Demon Deacons won 2 games and lost 9. Therefore, they did not win as many games as they lost (since 2 \u2260 9). So the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each result:\n\nRow 0: w\nRow1: l\nRow2: l\nRow3: l\nRow4: l\nRow5: l\nRow6: l\nRow7: l\nRow8: w\nRow9: l\nRow10: l\n\nYes, that's two wins and nine losses. So the claim is definitely FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows 11 games where the Demon Deacons won twice and lost nine times. Since they didn't win as many games as they lost, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various games from September to November 1972. The claim is that \"the highest number of points anyone scored be below 50.\" Hmm, I need to check if every team's highest score in these games is under 50.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row and identify the 'result' column because that shows the points scored by the home team. Wait, no\u2014the result is written as something like \"w 26 - 20\" which probably means the home team won 26-20, so they scored 26 points. But sometimes it's \"l 10 - 56\", meaning the away team scored 56.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify: in each game, two teams play, and the result is listed as Home Team vs Away Team. For example, the first row has Davidson playing at Groves Stadium, winning 26-20. So that means Davidson scored 26 points, and their opponent scored 20. But wait, no\u2014that might not be right. If the result is \"w 26 - 20\", then maybe it's the home team's score minus the away team's? Or is it total points?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about the highest number of points anyone scored being below 50. So for each game, I need to see what was the higher score between the two teams and check if it's below 50.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 09/09/1972: Davidson (home) vs SMU. Result is l 10-56. Wait, so Davidson lost 10-56. That means SMU scored 56 points. So the highest in this game was 56.\n2. 09/16/1972: SMU vs Tennessee. Result is w 10-56? No, wait, looking again: it's SMU at Texas Stadium, result l 10-56. So SMU lost 10-56, meaning the opponent (Tennessee) scored 56.\n3. 09/23/1972: 5 Tennessee vs North Carolina. Result is l 6-45. So their score was 6, and they lost 6-45, so opponent scored 45.\n4. 10/07/1972: Maryland at Byrd Stadium. Result is l 0-23. Opponent scored 23.\n5. 10/14/1972: North Carolina State vs NC. Result is l 13-42. Opponent scored 42.\n6. 10/21/1972: North Carolina vs NC. Result is l 0-21. Opponent scored 21.\n7. 10/28/1972: Clemson at Groves Stadium. Result is l 0-31. Opponent scored 31.\n8. 11/04/1972: South Carolina vs SC. Result is l 3-35. Opponent scored 35.\n9. 11/11/1972: Duke vs NC. Result is w 9-7. So Duke won 9-7, meaning they scored 9 points, opponent scored 7. Highest here was 9.\n10. 11/18/1972: Virginia at Groves Stadium. Result is l 12-15. Opponent scored 15.\n11. 11/25/1972: Virginia Tech vs NC. Result is l 9-44. Opponent scored 44.\n\nNow, looking for the highest score in each game. The maximum scores are:\n\n- 56 (SMU vs Davidson)\n- 56 (Tennessee vs SMU)\n- 45 (5 Tennessee vs NC)\n- 23\n- 42\n- 21\n- 31\n- 35\n- 9\n- 15\n- 44\n\nSo the highest score in any game is 56. That's above 50, so the claim that \"the highest number of points anyone scored be below 50\" is FALSE because there are games where scores went up to 56.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we analyzed each game's result and identified the maximum score in any game. Since one game had a score of 56 (which is above 50), the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Deacon being shutout three times but never by more than ten points is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says two main things:\n1. The Deacon was shutout three times.\n2. In those three shutouts, the opponent never scored by more than ten points.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several games with details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. My task is to find if there are three instances where the Deacon was shut out (i.e., their score is 'l' in the result column, indicating a loss) and that in each of those games, the opponent's score didn't exceed ten points.\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table and see which ones fit these criteria.\n\nLet me list all the games:\n\n1. 09/09/1972 vs Davidson: Result is w 26-20. So Deacon won; not a shutout.\n2. 09/16/1972 vs SMU: Result is l 10-56. Deacon lost, opponent's score is 56. That's way above ten, so this doesn't count towards the claim.\n3. 09/23/1972 vs 5 Tennessee: Result is l 6-45. Opponent scored 45; again over ten.\n4. 10/07/1972 vs Maryland: Result is l 0-23. Opponent scored 23, which is more than ten.\n5. 10/14/1972 vs North Carolina State: Result is l 13-42. Opponent scored 42; way over.\n6. 10/21/1972 vs North Carolina: Result is l 0-21. Opponent scored 21; that's over ten.\n7. 10/28/1972 vs Clemson: Result is l 0-31. Opponent scored 31, which is above ten.\n8. 11/04/1972 vs South Carolina: Result is l 3-35. Opponent scored 35; way over.\n9. 11/11/1972 vs Duke: Result is w 9-7. Deacon won; not a shutout.\n10. 11/18/1972 vs Virginia: Result is l 12-15. Opponent scored 15, which is more than ten.\n11. 11/25/1972 vs Virginia Tech: Result is l 9-44. Opponent scored 44, way over.\n\nNow, let's identify the Deacon's losses where the opponent didn't score more than ten points. From the above, looking for 'l' results and opponent scores <=10.\n\nLooking through each game:\n\n- Game 2: Opponent scored 56 >10 \u2192 Doesn't count.\n- Game3: 45>10 \u2192 No.\n- Game4:23>10\u2192No\n- Game5:42>10\u2192No\n- Game6:21>10\u2192No\n- Game7:31>10\u2192No\n- Game8:35>10\u2192No\n- Game10:15>10\u2192No\n\nWait, in none of the Deacon's losses did the opponent score ten points or less. The lowest was a shutout (0 points), but that's only one game.\n\nWait, actually, looking at each game:\n\nWait, in the table, when the result is 'l x - y', does 'x' represent the Deacon's score and 'y' the opponent's? So, for example, in row 2: l 10-56. Does that mean Deacon scored 10, opponent scored 56? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, I think I might have misunderstood the result column. Typically, in sports, the first number is the home team's score, and the second is the visitor's. But here, since the table is about the Deacon (the home team), perhaps 'l 10-56' means Deacon scored 10, opponent scored 56.\n\nBut wait, if that's the case, then in the games where the result is a loss, the Deacon's score would be the first number. So for example:\n\nIn row2: l 10-56 \u2192 Deacon lost, scoring 10, opponent scored 56. So opponent scored way over ten.\n\nRow3: l6-45 \u2192 Opponent scored 45.\n\nRow4: l0-23\u2192Opponent scored 23.\n\nSimilarly, in all the 'l' results, the opponent's score is more than ten except for one game where Deacon was shutout (opponent scored zero). So:\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n1. 09/09/1972 \u2192 Win. Not relevant.\n2. 09/16/1972 \u2192 Loss; Opponent scored 56. >10.\n3. 09/23/1972 \u2192 Loss; Opponent 45>10.\n4. 10/07/1972\u2192Loss; opponent 23>10.\n5. 10/14/1972\u2192Loss; opponent42>10.\n6. 10/21/1972\u2192Loss; opponent21>10.\n7. 10/28/1972\u2192Loss; opp31>10.\n8. 11/04/1972\u2192Loss; opp35>10.\n9. 11/11/1972\u2192Win; not a loss.\n10.11/18/1972\u2192Loss; opp15>10.\n11.11/25/1972\u2192Loss; opp44>10.\n\nWait, in none of the Deacon's losses did the opponent score ten points or less. The only time Deacon was shut out (opponent scored zero) is on 10/21 and 11/18? Wait, no, looking at row6: result l0-21\u2192Deacon lost, opponent scored21; that's not a shutout for the opponent. A shutout would mean the Deacon scored zero. So in rows where the result is 'l x - y', if x is 0, then it's a shutout by the opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood. Let me clarify: in sports terminology, a shutout occurs when the home team scores zero points. So for example, if Deacon (home) scored 0 and lost, that would be a shutout by the opponent.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row2: l10-56 \u2192 Deacon lost, but not a shutout.\n- Row3: l6-45\u2192Not a shutout.\n- Row4:l0-23\u2192Deacon scored 0, so opponent didn't score. Wait no: if it's 'l0-23', that would mean Deacon scored 0, and the opponent scored 23. So that is a shutout for the home team (Deacon). Similarly:\n\nRow6: l0-21 \u2192 Deacon scored0, opp21\u2192Shutout.\n\nRow7:l0-31\u2192Shutout.\n\nSo in rows where it's 'l x - y' and x=0, it means Deacon was shutout by the opponent. So let's identify those:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- Row4: l0-23 \u2192 Shutout.\n- Row6: l0-21 \u2192 Shutout.\n- Row7:l0-31\u2192Shutout.\n\nSo in these cases, the opponent scored y points, but it doesn't matter for our purpose because the question is about the Deacon's shutouts, i.e., when the Deacon didn't score any points. So regardless of how many points the opponent scored, if the Deacon scored zero, that's a shutout.\n\nNow, looking through all the games:\n\nDeacon had 4 losses where he was shut out (opponent scored points but Deacon didn't). Wait no: actually, in each of these 'l x - y' with x=0, it's a shutout. So how many times did that happen?\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nRow2:l10-56\u2192Not a shutout.\n\nRow3:l6-45\u2192No.\n\nRow4:l0-23\u2192Shutout.\n\nRow5:l13-42\u2192Deacon scored13, so not a shutout.\n\nWait, no: 'l x - y' where x is Deacon's score. So if x=0, it's a shutout.\n\nSo in the 11 games:\n\nGame2: l10-56 \u2192 Not.\n\nGame3:l6-45\u2192Not.\n\nGame4:l0-23\u2192Yes.\n\nGame5:l13-42\u2192No.\n\nGame6:l0-21\u2192Yes.\n\nGame7:l0-31\u2192Yes.\n\nGame8:l3-35\u2192Deacon scored3, not a shutout.\n\nGame9:Win\u2192No.\n\nGame10:l12-15\u2192Deacon scored12\u2192Not.\n\nGame11:l9-44\u2192Deacon scored9\u2192Not.\n\nSo total of three games where Deacon was shut out by the opponent:\n\nRow4 (10/07), Row6 (10/21), and Row7(10/28).\n\nIn each case, the opponent scored 23,21,31 respectively. So in none of these did the opponent score ten or fewer points.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the Deacon was shut out with the opponent scoring ten or fewer.\n\nIn all three cases, the opponent scored more than ten. Therefore, the Deacon did not have any home games where he was shutout and the opponent scored 10 or fewer points.\n\nThus, the answer is that there were zero such games.\n</think>\n\nThe Deacon experienced three shutouts during the season, but in each instance, the opposing team scored more than ten points. Therefore, there are no instances of the Deacon being shut out with the opponent scoring ten or fewer points.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{0}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"7 game be play in north carolina , and they be all at the same stadium\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. **Seven games are played in North Carolina.**\n2. **All these seven games take place at the same stadium.**\n\nTo verify this, I need to examine each relevant cell in the table. Let's go through each row and see where \"North Carolina\" appears as the opponent or location.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying rows where the term \"north carolina\" is present either in the opponent column or the location column. The claim mentions both the opponent (if they are North Carolina) and the location (stadium). \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- **09/09/1972**: Opponent is Davidson, Location is Groves Stadium Winston-Salem, NC. This is one game in North Carolina.\n  \n- **09/16/1972**: Opponent is SMU, Location is Texas Stadium Irving, TX. Not relevant.\n\n- **09/23/1972**: Opponent is 5 Tennessee, Location is Neyland Stadium Knoxville, TN. Not relevant.\n\n- **10/07/1972**: Opponent is Maryland, Location is Byrd Stadium College Park, MD. Not relevant.\n\n- **10/14/1972**: Opponent is North Carolina State, Location is Groves Stadium Winston-Salem, NC. This is another game in NC.\n\n- **10/21/1972**: Opponent is North Carolina, Location is Groves Stadium Winston-Salem, NC. Third game in NC.\n\n- **10/28/1972**: Opponent is Clemson, Location is Groves Stadium Winston-Salem, NC. Fourth game in NC.\n\n- **11/04/1972**: Opponent is South Carolina, Location is Williams-Brice Stadium Columbia, SC. Not relevant.\n\n- **11/11/1972**: Opponent is Duke, Location is Wallace Wade Stadium Durham, NC. Fifth game in NC.\n\n- **11/18/1972**: Opponent is Virginia, Location is Groves Stadium Winston-Salem, NC. Sixth game in NC.\n\n- **11/25/1972**: Opponent is Virginia Tech, Location is Groves Stadium Winston-Salem, NC. Seventh game in NC.\n\nSo, there are indeed seven games involving North Carolina either as the opponent or the location. Now, I need to check if all these games are played at the same stadium. \n\nLooking at the locations:\n\n- Groves Stadium Winston-Salem, NC appears in rows: 0, 5, 6, 7.\n- Wallace Wade Stadium Durham, NC is row 8.\n  \nWait, no, let me recount the rows where \"north carolina\" is involved and their locations. Specifically, looking for all games involving North Carolina (either as opponent or location):\n\n- Row 0: Davidson vs NC in Groves Stadium.\n- Row 14: NC State vs someone in Groves Stadium.\n- Row 21: NC vs someone in Groves Stadium.\n- Row 28: Clemson vs NC in Groves Stadium.\n- Row 11: Duke vs NC in Wallace Wade.\n- Row 18: Virginia vs NC in Groves.\n- Row 25: Virginia Tech vs NC in Groves.\n\nSo, the games are:\n\n1. Davidson (opponent) at Groves Stadium.\n2. NC State (opponent) at Groves.\n3. NC (opponent) at Groves.\n4. Clemson (opponent) at Groves.\n5. Duke (opponent) at Wallace Wade.\n6. Virginia (opponent) at Groves.\n7. Virginia Tech (opponent) at Groves.\n\nSo, out of seven games:\n\n- Five are at Groves Stadium.\n- One is at Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham, NC.\n\nThis means not all seven games are played at the same stadium\u2014Duke's game is at a different venue. Therefore, the claim that \"they be all at the same stadium\" is FALSE because one game was held at a different location.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: The claim says \"7 game be play in north carolina , and they be all at the same stadium.\" So, the games are either where North Carolina is the opponent or the location. But looking back, the claim might only refer to games where North Carolina is the opponent. That could change things.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is specifically about seven games where North Carolina is the opponent, all played at the same stadium. Let's check that.\n\nLooking for rows where the opponent is \"north carolina\":\n\n- Row 21: Opponent is NC.\n- Row 18: Opponent is NC.\n\nWait, in the table, I need to check each row:\n\nRow 0: Davidson\nRow 1: SMU\nRow 2: 5 Tennessee\nRow 3: Maryland\nRow 4: NC State\nRow 5: NC\nRow 6: Clemson\nRow 7: South Carolina\nRow 8: Duke\nRow 9: Virginia\nRow 10: Virginia Tech\n\nSo, rows where the opponent is \"north carolina\" (as per the table's 'opponent' column):\n\n- Row 5: Opponent NC at Groves Stadium.\n- Row 21: Opponent NC at Groves Stadium.\n\nWait, that's only two games. Maybe I misread earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Davidson (not NC)\nRow 1: SMU\nRow 2: 5 Tennessee\nRow 3: Maryland\nRow 4: NC State\nRow 5: NC \u2013 so opponent is NC.\nRow 6: Clemson\nRow 7: South Carolina\nRow 8: Duke\nRow 9: Virginia\nRow 10: Virginia Tech\n\nSo, only row 5 and row 9 (wait, row 9 is Virginia Tech vs someone). Wait no, in row 9, the opponent is Virginia Tech. So, the opponents are:\n\nLooking at 'opponent' column:\n\n- Row 0: Davidson\n- Row 1: SMU\n- Row 2: 5 Tennessee\n- Row 3: Maryland\n- Row 4: NC State\n- Row 5: NC\n- Row 6: Clemson\n- Row 7: South Carolina\n- Row 8: Duke\n- Row 9: Virginia\n- Row 10: Virginia Tech\n\nSo, only row 5 has opponent as NC. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused between 'opponent' and 'location.' Let me re-examine:\n\nIn the table, each row seems to list a team vs another team, with the first being the opponent.\n\nLooking at row 0: Davidson is the opponent of someone (maybe NC? But the team isn't specified in the headers. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.)\n\nWait, the user didn't provide clear table formatting. It's unclear if each row lists a game where the first team is the opponent or the home team.\n\nAssuming that the first team is the opponent:\n\nRow 0: Davidson (opponent) vs someone at Groves Stadium.\nRow 1: SMU vs someone at some stadium.\nEtc.\n\nBut without knowing which team is playing whom, it's hard to determine. Alternatively, perhaps each row lists a game where the location is specified as the venue.\n\nBut regardless, the user's task is to find if seven games involving North Carolina (either as opponent or location) are all played at the same stadium.\n\nFrom earlier analysis, there are indeed seven such games:\n\n1. Davidson vs NC: Groves\n2. NC State vs someone: Groves\n3. NC vs someone: Groves\n4. Clemson vs NC: Groves\n5. Duke vs NC: Wallace Wade\n6. Virginia vs NC: Groves\n7. Virginia Tech vs NC: Groves\n\nThus, five at Groves and one at Wallace Wade, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, if considering only games where North Carolina is the opponent:\n\nOnly row 5 (NC as opponent) and row 9? Wait no, in row 9, the opponent is Virginia Tech. So maybe only two games where NC is the opponent.\n\nThis makes it conflicting with the initial analysis. Therefore, I think the key is that there are seven games where either North Carolina is playing at Groves Stadium or being played by someone else at Groves. But since one game (Duke vs NC) is at a different venue, the claim is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be that not all seven games are at the same stadium; only six are, with one at Wallace Wade.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether seven games involving North Carolina as either the opponent or location are all played at the same stadium. Upon examining the data:\n\n- Five games are held at Groves Stadium.\n- One game is at Wallace Wade Stadium.\n\nThus, not all seven games are at a single venue.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because not all seven games involving North Carolina are played at the same stadium.",
