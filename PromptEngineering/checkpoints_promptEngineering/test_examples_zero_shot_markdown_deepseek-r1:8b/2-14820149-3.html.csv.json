    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that in 1988 for the 250cc class, the player had 221 points, and in 1989 for the same class, they only had 98 points.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. It has columns: year, class, team, points, and wins. Each row represents a specific year, class, team, their points, and wins.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two years: 1988 and 1989, both in the 250cc class. So I need to focus on those rows where the class is 250cc for those years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 1988, under 250cc, the points are 221.\n- For 1989, under 250cc, the points are 98.\n\nSo both of these points match exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is true based on the given data.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant columns are 'year' and 'class'. For each year mentioned (1988 and 1989), we look at the class which is 250cc.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- 1988 row, 'points' column because it's 221.\n- 1989 row, 'points' column because it's 98.\n\nWait, but in the instructions, the relevant cells should include both row indices and column names. So each relevant cell is an object with \"row_index\" (the index of the row) and \"column_name\".\n\nBut wait, the claim refers to points for two specific years. So do I need to include all columns related to those rows? Or just the points?\n\nThe instruction says: check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\n\nIn this case, the conditions are about points in 1988 (250cc) being 221 and in 1989 (250cc) being 98. So for each of those points, I need to identify their respective row indices and column names.\n\nSo for 1988, it's row index 4, points column. For 1989, it's row index 5, points column.\n\nWait, let me count the rows:\n\nLooking at the markdown table:\n\n1. 1984: row 0\n2. 1985: row 1\n3. 1986: row 2\n4. 1987: row 3\n5. 1988: row 4\n6. 1989: row 5\n7. 1990: row 6\n8. 1991: row 7\n9. 1992: row 8\n10. 1993: row 9\n\nSo yes, 1988 is row index 4, and 1989 is row index 5.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n\nI think that's it. So in the JSON, I need to include these two objects under \"relevant_cells\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data for both years and points mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim again: \"team ducados - yamaha have the same number of point in 1990 and 1991 for the 500cc class with 121.\" So they're saying that in 1990 and 1991, Ducs had 121 points each in the 500cc class.\n\nI need to check the table for these years and see if that's correct. Let me look at the table columns: year, class, team, points, wins.\n\nLooking at the 500cc class first because the claim is about that. So I'll scan through the rows:\n\nIn 1990 (row 9), team is ducados - yamaha, and points are 121.\nIn 1991 (row 10), same team, and points are also 121.\n\nSo both years have 121 points. That seems to match the claim. Therefore, it should be TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to find which specific cells in the table confirm this. So for 1990, it's row index 9 (since counting starts at 0), column \"points\". For 1991, row index 10, same column.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include both of these points columns for those rows.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the 500cc class points for 1990 and 1991.

The claim states: \"the year with the most win in the 250cc class with team ducados - yamaha be 1988 with 3 win.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that in the 250cc class, for the team named \"ducados - yamaha,\" the year with the most wins is 1988, and those wins amount to 3.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the relevant columns: year, class, team, points, and wins. The claim specifically mentions the 250cc class and the team \"ducados - yamaha.\"\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to check for entries that match these criteria.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- 1984 | 250cc | yamaha | ... | 0\nThis is a different team, so it doesn't fit.\n\nSecond row:\n- 1985 | 250cc | jj cobas | ... | 0\nAgain, not the correct team.\n\nThird and fourth rows are for other classes (500cc) or different years but also don't match the criteria until we reach:\n\nFifth row:\n- 1988 | 250cc | ducados - yamaha | 221 points | 3 wins\nThis matches both the class and team. The number of wins is 3.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other year in the same class and team has more than 3 wins. If another year has a higher number of wins, then the claim would be false. Let's look through all the years for the 250cc class with \"ducados - yamaha.\"\n\n- 1987: 46 points, 0 wins\n- 1988: 221 points, 3 wins\n- 1989: 98 points, 0 wins\n- 1990: 121 points, 0 wins\n- 1991: 121 points, 0 wins\n- 1992: 61 points, 0 wins\n\nNone of the other years for that team and class have more than 3 wins. Therefore, 1988 is indeed the year with the highest number of wins (3) in the specified category.\n\nSo, the claim is supported by the data presented in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine if a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"there be 8 point for the 1985 250cc class , but only 4 point for the 1986cc class.\"\n\nI need to parse this into two main parts. The first part is about the 1985 250cc class having 8 points. The second part says that in 1986, the 500cc class (since the table doesn't have an '86cc class, it's probably a typo for 500cc) has only 4 points.\n\nLet me check the table year by year.\n\nStarting with 1985: The row is for 1985 and the class is 250cc. Looking at the points column, it shows 8 points. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, looking for 1986 in the table. The years go from 1984 to 1993. In 1986, the class is 500cc, and the points are 4. So yes, that matches the claim's second part.\n\nWait, but the original table doesn't have a typo; it correctly lists the classes as 250cc or 500cc. The user probably meant 500cc for 1986. Since the table has 4 points for 500cc in 1986, that supports the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are true based on the table data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table as both points mentioned are correctly listed for their respective years and classes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the year with the most point for the 250cc class be 1988 with a total of 221 points.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and understand what each column represents. The columns are Year, class, team, points, and wins. The claim is specifically about the 250cc class, so I'll focus on that.\n\nLooking through the table, I see rows for different years. For each year, under \"class\" it's either 250cc or 500cc. So I need to only consider the rows where \"class\" is 250cc because the claim is about that specific class.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n1984: class is 250cc, points are 0.\n1985: class is 250cc, points are 8.\n1986: not 250cc.\n1987: 250cc, points 46.\n1988: 250cc, points 221.\n1989: 250cc, points 98.\n1990: 500cc, so not relevant.\n1991: 500cc, not relevant.\n1992: 500cc, not relevant.\n1993: 500cc, not relevant.\n\nSo the relevant rows for 250cc are from 1984 to 1993, excluding the years where class is 500cc. Now I need to check which of these has the highest points.\n\nLooking at their points:\n1984: 0\n1985:8\n1987:46\n1988:221\n1989:98\n\nSo the points for 250cc in those years are: 0,8,46,221,98. The highest among these is 221 in 1988.\n\nThe claim says it's 1988 with 221 points. So that seems correct based on the table.\n\nNow I need to make sure there isn't a higher value elsewhere. But from what I see, 1988 has the highest points for the 250cc class. There are no other entries in the 250cc column after 1992 except for 1993, which is under 500cc.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be true. The relevant cells would be the row for 1988 and \"points\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in 1988, the 250cc class had the highest points of 221. No other year's 250cc entry has a higher point value. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has columns: year, class, team, points, and wins. Each row represents a specific year, class, team, their points, and their number of wins.\n\nI need to check two specific points from the claim:\n1. In 1988, did the player have 221 points in the 250cc class?\n2. In 1989, did the player have 78 points in the 250cc class?\n\nLet me go through each year step by step.\n\nStarting with 1984: It's a 250cc class for Yamaha with 0 points and 0 wins. Not relevant since we're looking at 1988 and 1989.\n\n1985: Also 250cc, but for JJ Cobas with 8 points. Doesn't match the claim's team name, which is \"ducados - yamaha,\" so probably not relevant unless I'm missing something.\n\n1986: 500cc class for Cagiva with 4 points. Not relevant as we're looking at 250cc in 1988 and 1989.\n\n1987: 250cc for Ducados - Yamaha with 46 points. This is a different year than the claim, so not relevant yet.\n\n1988: Here's the first data point from the claim. Looking at the table, in 1988, under 250cc class, the team is \"ducados - yamaha\" and points are 221. That matches the first part of the claim. So the 1988 row is definitely relevant because it has the 221 points for 250cc.\n\nNow, checking 1989: The claim says 78 points in 250cc. Let me look at the table. In 1989, under 250cc, the team is again \"ducados - yamaha,\" but the points are listed as 98. Wait, that's a discrepancy because the claim states 78 points.\n\nSo there's a conflict here. According to the table, in 1988, they had 221 points for 250cc, which supports the first part of the claim. However, in 1989, the table shows 98 points, not 78 as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim is incorrect based on the table data. So the overall statement isn't entirely true because it incorrectly states that there were only 78 points in 1989 when actually it was 98.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if I'm looking at the correct rows and columns. Let me go through each relevant row again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 1988: year=1988, class=250cc, team=ducados - yamaha, points=221. Correct.\n\nFor 1989: year=1989, class=250cc, team=ducados - yamaha, points=98. Yes, that's what the table shows. So the claim says 78, but it should be 98.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because one of its data points doesn't match the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the player having 221 points in 1988 and 78 points in 1989 for the 250cc class is only partially accurate. The 1988 figure matches, but the 1989 figure does not; it's actually 98 points.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

The user probably meant to say that the team Ducados-Yamaha had the same points in both 1990 and 1991 in the 500cc class, and the number mentioned is 61.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nThe columns are year, class, team, points, wins.\n\nI need to check for the years 1990 and 1991, in the 500cc class, what the points were for Ducados-Yamaha.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row one by one.\n\nStarting with 1990: \n- Year is 1990.\n- Class is 500cc.\n- Team is Ducados - yamaha.\n- Points are 121.\n- Wins are 0.\n\nNext, 1991:\n- Year is 1991.\n- Class is 500cc.\n- Team is Ducados - yamaha.\n- Points are also 121.\n- Wins are 0 again.\n\nSo, for both 1990 and 1991, the points are 121 each. The claim says \"61,\" which doesn't match. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the table, looking at 1992:\n- Year is 1992.\n- Class is 500cc.\n- Team is Ducados - yamaha.\n- Points: 61.\n- Wins: 0.\n\nSo in 1992, their points were 61. But the claim refers to 1990 and 1991 having 61 each, which isn't correct because those years have 121.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: I need to list the cells that confirm this. So, looking at the team Ducados-Yamaha in 500cc class:\n\nFor 1990, it's row index 8 (since the first row is 1984), but wait, let me count the rows properly.\n\nWait, the table starts with 1984 as row 0 or row 1? Let me check:\n\nThe markdown table starts with | year | class | team ... So the first data row is for 1984, which would be row index 0. Then each subsequent year increments by one in the row index.\n\nSo:\n\n1984: row 0\n1985: row 1\n...\n1990: let's see. From 1984 to 1990 is 6 years later (including 1984). Wait, no, 1990 -1984 = 6, so it's row 6? Let me count:\n\nRow 0:1984\nRow1:1985\nRow2:1986\nRow3:1987\nRow4:1988\nRow5:1989\nRow6:1990\nYes.\n\nSo for 1990 and 1991:\n\n- 1990 is row 6, points column.\n- 1991 is row7, points column.\n\nEach of these has points as 121. The claim says 61, which is incorrect because in 1992 (row9), points are 61.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be for 1990 and 1991, checking their points, to show that they have higher points than claimed, thus making the statement false.\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are those where row index is 6 and 7, column_name 'points'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me look at the columns: year, class, team, points, wins.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1984: 250cc, Yamaha, points 0, wins 0\n- 1985: 250cc, jj cobas, points 8, wins 0\n- 1986: 500cc, Cagiva, points 4, wins 0\n- 1987: 250cc, Ducados - Yamaha, points 46, wins 0\n- 1988: 250cc, Ducados - Yamaha, points 221, wins 3\n- 1989: 250cc, Ducados - Yamaha, points 98, wins 0\n- 1990: 500cc, Ducados - Yamaha, points 121, wins 0\n- 1991: 500cc, Ducados - Yamaha, points 121, wins 0\n- 1992: 500cc, Ducados - Yamaha, points 61, wins 0\n- 1993: 500cc, Cagiva, points 7, wins 0\n\nSo I need to focus on the rows where class is \"250cc\" and team is \"ducados - yamaha\". From the table, that's 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989. \n\nLooking at the 'wins' column for these:\n\n- 1984: 0\n- 1985: 0\n- 1987: 0\n- 1988: 3 wins\n- 1989: 0\n\nSo in 1988, Ducados - Yamaha had 3 wins in the 250cc class. The claim says it's 2 wins. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check 1988. Yes, points are 221 and wins are 3. So the claim states 2 wins, but the table shows 3. That would mean the claim is incorrect because the actual number of wins was higher than stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's a typo or something. Let me see: the claim says \"the year with the most win... be 1988 with 2 win.\" So it's saying in 1988, they had 2 wins, but according to the table, it's 3.\n\nSo that would make the claim false because the actual number of wins is higher than what's claimed. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nAlso, looking for relevant cells: I need to mark all rows where class is 250cc and team is Ducados - Yamaha. Those are row indices 4 (1988), 5 (1989). Wait, no, let me count:\n\nRow index starts at 0. So the years are:\n\nrow 3: 1984\nrow 4: 1985\nrow 5: 1986\nrow 6: 1987\nrow 7: 1988\nrow 8: 1989\nrow 9: 1990\nrow 10: 1991\nrow 11: 1992\nrow 12: 1993\n\nWait, no. Wait, the table has 10 rows from 1984 to 1993. So each row corresponds to a specific year.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- row 0: 1984\n- row 1: 1985\n- row 2: 1986\n- row 3: 1987\n- row 4: 1988\n- row 5: 1989\n- row 6: 1990\n- row 7: 1991\n- row 8: 1992\n- row 9: 1993\n\nSo for class \"250cc\" and team \"ducados - yamaha\", the relevant rows are:\n\nrow 3 (1984): no, because it's Yamaha.\nWait, wait. Let me list all the entries properly.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n0: year=1984, class=250cc, team=yamaha\n1: 1985, 250cc, jj cobas\n2: 1986, 500cc, cagiva\n3: 1987, 250cc, ducados - yamaha\n4: 1988, 250cc, ducados - yamaha\n5: 1989, 250cc, ducados - yamaha\n6: 1990, 500cc, ducados - yamaha\n7: 1991, 500cc, ducados - yamaha\n8: 1992, 500cc, ducados - yamaha\n9: 1993, 500cc, cagiva\n\nSo rows with class 250cc and team \"ducados - yamaha\" are:\n\nrow 3 (1987), row4 (1988), row5 (1989).\n\nIn each of these, the wins are 0,3,0 respectively.\n\nThe claim is specifically about 1988 having 2 wins. So in row4 (1988), the 'wins' column has 3.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check would be:\n\n- row index=4 (1988): class, team, and wins columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1988, Ducados - Yamaha had 2 wins in the 250cc class. However, according to the table, they had 3 wins that year. This discrepancy means the claim is false.\n\nAnswer: \"FALSE\"\n\nRelevant cells:\n- row index 4 (1988), columns 'class', 'team', and 'wins'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"there be 8 point for the 1991 250cc class , but only 4 point for the 1986cc class.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim is saying. It's making two assertions about two different classes in specific years: \n\n1. In 1991, the 250cc class has 8 points.\n2. In 1986, the 500cc class (since 250cc isn't mentioned here) has 4 points.\n\nWait, no, actually, the claim refers to 250cc and 1986cc, but looking at the table, there's no 1986cc class. The columns are year, class, team, points, wins. Let me check each row:\n\n- 1984: 250cc\n- 1985: 250cc\n- 1986: 500cc\n- 1987: 250cc\n- 1988: 250cc\n- 1989: 250cc\n- 1990: 500cc\n- 1991: 500cc\n- 1992: 500cc\n- 1993: 500cc\n\nSo, the 250cc class only exists from 1984 to 1991, with some years missing. Wait, actually, looking at each row, the classes are either 250cc or 500cc.\n\nWait, but in 1991, the class is 500cc for ducados - yamaha. So the claim refers to 1991 and 250cc, which doesn't make sense because in 1991, the team is under 500cc. Therefore, maybe I misread the claim. Let me recheck.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 8 point for the 1991 250cc class , but only 4 point for the 1986cc class.\" So it's saying two things:\n\na) In 1991, the 250cc class had 8 points.\nb) In 1986, the 500cc (since that's what's in the table) class had 4 points.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the claim, it's written as \"1986cc\", which might be a typo. But looking at the table, in 1986, there's a 500cc class with cagiva having 4 points. So maybe the claim is trying to say that in 1986, the 500cc had 4 points.\n\nSo let me parse the claim more carefully:\n\n- \"there be 8 point for the 1991 250cc class\" \u2192 In 1991, under 250cc, points are 8.\n- \"but only 4 point for the 1986cc class\" \u2192 In 1986, under 500cc (since 250cc doesn't exist in 1986), points are 4.\n\nNow, I need to check both parts against the table.\n\nFirst part: 1991 and 250cc. Looking at the table:\n\n- 1991 is a row with year 1991, class 500cc, team ducados - yamaha, points 121, wins 0. There's no entry for 250cc in 1991. So the claim says there are 8 points for 1991 250cc, but according to the table, in 1991, it's 500cc with 121 points.\n\nWait, that means the first part of the claim is incorrect because 1991 doesn't have a 250cc entry; it only has 500cc. Therefore, the claim is making an error there, which would make the entire statement false.\n\nBut let me double-check. The table has:\n\n- 1984: 250cc\n- 1985: 250cc\n- 1986: 500cc\n- 1987: 250cc\n- 1988: 250cc\n- 1989: 250cc\n- 1990: 500cc\n- 1991: 500cc\n- 1992: 500cc\n- 1993: 500cc\n\nSo, in 1991, it's definitely 500cc. Therefore, the claim's first part is incorrect because there are no points for a 250cc class in 1991.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the team names. Let me check each row:\n\n1984: yamaha \u2192 250cc, points 0\n1985: jj cobas \u2192 250cc, points 8\n1986: cagiva \u2192 500cc, points 4\n1987: ducados - yamaha \u2192 250cc, points 46\n1988: ducados - yamaha \u2192 250cc, points 221, wins 3\n1989: ducados - yamaha \u2192 250cc, points 98\n1990: ducados - yamaha \u2192 500cc, points 121\n1991: ducados - yamaha \u2192 500cc, points 121\nWait, that's the same as 1990 and 1992. So in 1991, it's definitely 500cc with 121 points.\n\nSo the claim says 1991 250cc has 8 points, which is incorrect because 250cc doesn't exist in 1991; it only exists in certain years: 1984-1989 (for 250cc) and 1990-1993 for 500cc. So, the first part of the claim is wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the second part says that in 1986, there are 4 points for 1986cc. But looking at the table, 1986 has a 500cc class with cagiva having 4 points. So if we interpret \"1986cc\" as a typo and they meant 500cc, then the second part is correct.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"1986cc\", which doesn't match any column in the table because the columns are year, class (which includes 250cc and 500cc), team, points, wins. So \"1986cc\" isn't a column or class name; it's probably a typo for 500cc.\n\nBut regardless of that, since the first part is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that in 1991, the 250cc class had 8 points. However, the table shows that in 1991, there was no 250cc class\u2014it only lists the 500cc class for that year with 121 points. Additionally, while it may be a typo, referring to the 1986cc class doesn't align correctly since the table uses \"year\" and \"class.\" Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"the year with the most point for the 250cc class be 1985 with a total of 221 point.\" Hmm, wait a minute, I think there might be a typo here. The claim says \"point\" but looking at the table, the columns are points and wins. So, maybe it's supposed to be \"points\". That makes more sense.\n\nNow, focusing on the 250cc class. I need to find out which year had the highest points in this category. Let me look through each row where the class is 250cc.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1984: 250cc, yamaha, 0 points\n- 1985: 250cc, jj cobas, 8 points\n- 1986: 500cc, cagiva, 4 points (so not relevant for 250cc)\n- 1987: 250cc, ducados - yamaha, 46 points\n- 1988: 250cc, ducados - yamaha, 221 points\n- 1989: 250cc, ducados - yamaha, 98 points\n- 1990: 500cc, ducados - yamaha, 121 points (not relevant)\n- 1991: 500cc, ducados - yamaha, 121 points (not relevant)\n- 1992: 500cc, ducados - yamaha, 61 points (not relevant)\n- 1993: 500cc, cagiva, 7 points (not relevant)\n\nSo, for the 250cc class, the years are 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1989. Now, I need to check which of these has the highest points.\n\nLooking at each year's points:\n\n- 1984: 0\n- 1985: 8\n- 1987: 46\n- 1988: 221\n- 1989: 98\n\nClearly, 1988 has the highest points for the 250cc class with 221 points. The claim mentions 1985 with 221 points, which doesn't match because in 1985, it's only 8 points.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the table. Oh, looking at row 1988: year is 1988, class is 250cc, team is ducados - yamaha, points are 221. So that's correct.\n\nThe claim says the year with the most points in 250cc is 1985, but it should actually be 1988. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because 1988 has more points than 1985.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]}",
