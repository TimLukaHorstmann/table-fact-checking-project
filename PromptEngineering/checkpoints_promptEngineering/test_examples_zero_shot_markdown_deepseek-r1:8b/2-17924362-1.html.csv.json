    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 be at the San Diego Stadium.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about the lowest attendance in a game that took place in 1975 for the Denver Broncos at San Diego Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a week of games, starting from Week 1 to Week 14. The columns include 'week', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', 'game site', 'record', and 'attendance'.\n\nI need to check if there's a game in 1975 where the Denver Broncos played at San Diego Stadium with the lowest attendance.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, all the games listed are from September to December 2019. None of these dates are in 1975. So that immediately makes me think something is off. The claim refers to a game in 1975, but the table doesn't have any data for that year.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the claim is about the lowest attendance at games played by the Denver Broncos at San Diego Stadium, regardless of the year. But no, the claim specifically mentions \"in 1975,\" which is a specific year.\n\nIn the table provided, all dates are in September and October, up to December, but none in 1975. So there's no data here that relates to 1975. Therefore, it's impossible for the claim to be based on the information given because the relevant games aren't present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is incomplete, but according to what's provided, all game dates are after September 21, 2019, so definitely not in 1975.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data supporting the claim about 1975 attendance at San Diego Stadium, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game in 1975, but the table only includes games from 2019 onwards. Since there are no relevant entries for 1975, the claim cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"in 1975, the Denver Bronco never have more than 2 wins in a row.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being claimed here. It says that during 1975, the Broncos didn't have more than two consecutive wins at any point. So, I need to check the team's performance week by week in 1975 and see if there are any instances where they won three games back-to-back.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list the games from week 1 to week 14 of a season, with each row containing details like the opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The dates range from September 21 to December 20, which likely spans multiple months, so this could be part of a single season, possibly in 1975.\n\nI need to focus on the 'result' column to see how many wins they had in a row each week. Let's go through each week sequentially:\n\n- Week 1: They won (record 1-0). So that's one win.\n- Week 2: Another win (2-0). Now, two consecutive wins.\n- Week 3: Lost, so the streak breaks at two wins.\n- Week 4: Lost again, so no streak here.\n- Week 5: Won (3-2). So now they have one win after a loss.\n- Week 6: Lost. Streak is broken.\n- Week 7: Lost. No streak.\n- Week 8: Lost. No streak.\n- Week 9: Won (4-5). One win.\n- Week 10: Lost. Streak broken.\n- Week 11: Won (5-6). Now, after a loss, they have one win.\n- Week 12: Lost. Streak is just one.\n- Week 13: Won (6-7). So now, after losing week 12, they get their first win.\n- Week 14: Lost. Streak broken.\n\nWait, but in this table, it goes up to week 14, and the dates suggest that weeks are numbered starting from week 1 on September 21. But I'm not sure if this is the entire season or just part of it. However, since the claim is about 1975, I assume these are all the games played in 1975.\n\nLooking at each win streak after a loss:\n\n- Week 2: They won again after week 1, so that's two in a row (weeks 1 and 2). But then they lost in week 3. So the maximum was two.\n- Then, week 5: After losing in week 4, they won weeks 5, but it's only one win before losing again.\n- Similarly, other wins are isolated or followed by losses.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the results and track consecutive wins:\n\nWeek | Result\n-----|-------\n1    | W\n2    | W\n3    | L\n4    | L\n5    | W\n6    | L\n7    | L\n8    | L\n9    | W\n10   | L\n11   | W\n12   | L\n13   | W\n14   | L\n\nSo, the maximum number of consecutive wins in this table is two (weeks 1 and 2). Then, they lose. After that, week 5 is a win but preceded by a loss. Similarly for weeks 9,11,13: each followed by a loss except maybe if there's a streak I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking at the exact results:\n\nWeek 1: W (record 1-0)\nWeek 2: W (2-0) \u2192 two in a row\nWeek 3: L \u2192 streak broken\nWeek 5: W after losing week 4\nWeek 9: W after losing week 8\nWeek 11: W after losing week 10\nWeek 13: W after losing week 12\n\nSo, each time they have a win, it's only one in a row because the next game is a loss. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive wins in 1975 was two.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are more weeks not listed here. The table goes up to week 14, but if that's all the games played in 1975, then yes, they never had three in a row.\n\nWait another thought: the claim says \"never have more than 2 wins in a row.\" So as per this, it's TRUE because the maximum was two. But I should make sure there are no other weeks not shown here where they might have had three in a row.\n\nAssuming that the table lists all games for 1975, then the claim is TRUE. If not, and if there were more games elsewhere, maybe with more consecutive wins, but without that info, we can only go by what's provided.\n\nBut wait, the dates are from September 21 to December 20, which covers several months. However, the table stops at week 14, so perhaps the season ended around then. If all games are accounted for and they never had three wins in a row, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the ones showing each win followed by a loss or another outcome that prevents three in a row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Denver Broncos did not have more than two consecutive wins in 1975. By examining the table, the maximum number of consecutive wins observed is two (weeks 1 and 2). Since there are no instances where they won three games back-to-back, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"The Denver Broncos did not have more than two consecutive wins in 1975.\",\n  \"explanation\": \"By examining the provided results, the maximum number of consecutive wins observed was two (weeks 1 and 2).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 21.\" \n\nFirst, I should check when the data in this table actually occurs. Looking at the 'week' and 'date' columns, week 1 is September 21, and it goes up through week 14 on December 20. So all these games are in 1975 because that's the only year covered here.\n\nNext, I need to find any losses where the Broncos scored points close to or equal to 21. The claim mentions the \"most points\" they scored in a loss being 21, so we're looking for whether there was a game where they lost and scored exactly 21 points.\n\nLooking through each week:\n\n- Week 1: They won with 37 points.\n- Week 2: Won with 23.\n- Week 3: Lost 14-38. They only scored 14 here, which is less than 21.\n- Week 4: Lost 9-20. Score was 9, not 21.\n- Week 5: Won 16-15. So no loss here.\n- Week 6: Lost 13-26. Their score was 13.\n- Week 7: Lost 17-42. They scored 17.\n- Week 8: Lost 16-17. Score was 16.\n- Week 9: Won 27-17. No loss.\n- Week 10: Lost 21-35. Here, the Broncos scored 21 points in a loss. That fits the claim because they lost but scored 21.\n\nThen I check weeks beyond that:\n\n- Week 11: Won in overtime with 13-10. So no loss here.\n- Week 12: Lost 10-17. Their score was 10, not 21.\n- Week 13: Won 25-10. No loss.\n- Week 14: Lost 13-14. They scored 13.\n\nSo the only game where they lost and scored exactly 21 points is Week 10 on November 23 against the Atlanta Falcons. The claim says \"the most point,\" which might be a typo for \"points.\" Assuming it's about the highest, this week fits.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there was at least one loss in 1975 where they scored 21 points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco finish the season with a loss at the miami orange bowl\". So, I need to check if in 1975, the Denver Broncos played their last game (regular season finale) against Miami at the Miami Orange Bowl and lost.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists games from week 1 to week 14, with each row representing a week, the date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. However, I notice that all the dates in the table are from September to December, which aligns with the 1975 NFL season (typically running through January, but the last game might be in late December).\n\nWait, the claim mentions finishing the season with a loss at the Miami Orange Bowl. So, I need to check if there's a game against the Miami Dolphins in December or early January? But looking at the table, the latest date is December 20 for week 14, which was against the Miami Dolphins, but that was a loss (13-14). However, week 14 is the 14th week, which might be their last game of the season.\n\nWait, no\u2014NFL seasons usually end in January, so perhaps the table only goes up to week 14, and the actual last game is in January. But the claim specifies a loss at the Miami Orange Bowl, which is in Miami. So I need to check if there's a game against Miami in December or January where they lost.\n\nLooking through the table: Week 12 is December 8 against Oakland Raiders, week 13 on December 14 against Philadelphia Eagles, and week 14 on December 20 against Miami Dolphins. The result for week 14 was a loss (13-14). So that would be their last game of the season in 1975.\n\nTherefore, the Denver Broncos did play their last game in week 14, which was a loss to the Miami Dolphins at the Miami Orange Bowl. That matches the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row_index for the Miami game (week 14) and the opponent column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the Denver Broncos played their final game of the 1975 season against the Miami Dolphins with a loss at the Miami Orange Bowl.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time.\" So, the key points here are:\n\n1. Year: 1975\n2. Team: Denver Broncos\n3. They went into overtime exactly once that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week of games for what I assume is the 2023 season because the dates start from September 21 and go through December. However, the team names don't match any real NFL teams except for some like Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, etc., which are real teams but in different years. Wait, no, actually, the Broncos are a real team, but this table seems to be from a fictional context or perhaps an older season because 2023 is the current year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that the claim refers to 1975, which would likely be before 2023, so the table provided doesn't directly reflect 1975. However, the user might have included a sample table for instructions, and perhaps the actual data needed is elsewhere. But since the problem statement says \"given in markdown format\" as the table, I need to work with that.\n\nBut wait, the claim refers to 1975, but the table provided starts from September 2023, so it's not relevant. Therefore, perhaps there's an error here because the table doesn't contain data for 1975. Alternatively, maybe the table is part of a larger dataset and I need to find cells related to the Broncos in 1975.\n\nHowever, looking at the column names: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance. There's no year column. Therefore, the table provided doesn't include the year, so it's impossible to verify if any of these games were played in 1975.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The claim is about the Broncos going into overtime only once in 1975. But the table doesn't have data for 1975, so how can we check this? Unless the table is supposed to represent a different year or there's a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is not directly related because it's from 2023, but the claim is about a historical event in 1975. Since the table doesn't include any games from 1975, I can't find any relevant cells that would support or contradict the claim.\n\nWait, but perhaps the claim is about the Broncos going into overtime only once in the season referenced by the table. For example, if the table represents the 2023 season, then how many times did the Broncos go into overtime? Let's check the 'result' column for any games that went into overtime.\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n- Week 1: No overtime mentioned.\n- Week 2: No overtime.\n- Week 3: No overtime.\n- Week 4: No overtime.\n- Week 5: No overtime.\n- Week 6: No overtime.\n- Week 7: No overtime.\n- Week 8: No overtime.\n- Week 9: No overtime.\n- Week 10: No overtime.\n- Week 11: It says \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\", so that's an overtime game. So, in week 11, they went into overtime and won.\n- Weeks 12-14: No overtime mentioned.\n\nSo, in the 2023 season, the Broncos have only one game that went into overtime, which is week 11 against the Chargers. Therefore, if the claim was about 2023, it would be true because there's only one overtime game.\n\nBut wait, the claim refers to 1975, not 2023. So if the table doesn't include any games from 1975, then we can't verify the claim based on this data. Therefore, the relevant cells are none because the information needed (games in 1975) isn't present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the table is part of a dataset where each row represents a game, and if I look for games played by the Broncos in overtime in 1975, but since the table doesn't include the year, it's impossible to confirm or deny.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about the team going into overtime only once in their history, not necessarily in 1975. But that would be a different claim, and again, the table doesn't show enough info.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table's context. The problem says \"determining whether a claim about the following table is TRUE or FALSE.\" So the table must contain data relevant to the claim, which is about the Broncos going into overtime once in 1975.\n\nBut since the table starts from September 21 (likely 2023) and goes through December 2023, it's for the 2023 season. Therefore, any games in the table are from 2023, not 1975. So there's no way to verify the claim based on this data because the claim refers to a different year.\n\nHowever, looking again at the 'result' column, week 11 had an overtime game. So if the claim was about the Broncos having only one overtime game in 2023, then it would be TRUE. But since the claim is specifically about 1975, and the table doesn't include data from that year, I can't confirm or deny.\n\nWait, but maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the table is supposed to represent 1975. Or perhaps the team names are different. Wait, no, the opponent names don't match 1975 either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the Broncos going into overtime only once in their history, which would require checking historical data, not present here. But since the problem says \"about the following table,\" I have to assume that the relevant data is within the table.\n\nTherefore, if the table includes any games from 1975 involving the Broncos, then we can check. But looking at the opponents and dates, it's all 2023. So no, there are no relevant cells because the claim refers to a different year.\n\nThus, I think the answer is that there are no relevant cells in the table to verify or deny the claim about the Broncos going into overtime once in 1975.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires evaluating a claim about the Denver Broncos playing only one overtime game in 1975. The provided table lists games from September 2023 onwards, not including any from 1975. Therefore, there is no data within the table to verify or deny the claim.\n\n**Answer:** There are no relevant cells in the table to confirm or disprove the claim about the Denver Broncos playing only one overtime game in 1975.",

The claim is: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco never have more than 1 win in a row.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. The Broncos are the team in question here. The claim is about their performance in 1975. It's saying that during that season, they never had more than one consecutive win at any point.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list games played by weeks from September to December in 1975. Each row has details like the week number, date, opponent, result, game site, and attendance. The \"result\" column indicates whether they won (w) or lost (l). There's also a \"record\" column that shows their cumulative wins and losses.\n\nWait, but the claim is about consecutive wins, not the overall record. So I need to check if there are any instances where the Broncos had two or more consecutive wins at any point in the season.\n\nLooking through each week:\n\nWeek 1: They won (1-0). Since it's the first week, no previous win to consider for a streak of two.\n\nWeek 2: They won again (2-0). So that's two consecutive wins. This would mean that the claim is false because they had at least two in a row here.\n\nBut let me check further to see if there are more instances beyond Week 2.\n\nWeek 3: Lost, so no issue there.\n\nWeek 4: Lost again. \n\nWeek 5: Won (3-2). So from Week 2 to Week 5, they have Week 2 as a win and Week 3 as a loss, then Week 4 as another loss, and Week 5 as a win. That doesn't make a streak longer than one.\n\nWait, but the key point is whether there was any time when they had two wins in a row. From Week 1 to Week 2: W, W\u2014so that's two in a row. Therefore, the claim should be false because they did have at least two consecutive wins in the season.\n</think>\n\nThe Broncos won their first two games of the 1975 season (weeks 1 and 2), which constitutes two consecutive wins.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 15.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see what information it has. The table lists each week of the season, with details like date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different game.\n\nThe key here is to find games where the Broncos lost, because the claim is about their highest point total in a loss. So I'll go through each row and check the 'result' column for losses (denoted by 'l').\n\nStarting from week 1: They played the Kansas City Chiefs and won. So that's not a loss.\n\nWeek 2: Against the Green Bay Packers, they also won. Not relevant.\n\nWeek 3: Buffalo Bills game. Result is a loss with a score of 14 - 38. So Broncos scored 14 points in this loss.\n\nWeek 4: Lost to Pittsburgh Steelers 9-20. So their points here are 9.\n\nWeek 5: Won against Cleveland Browns, so not a loss.\n\nWeek 6: Lost to Kansas City Chiefs, 13-26. Broncos scored 13.\n\nWeek 7: Lost to Oakland Raiders, 17-42. Score was 17.\n\nWeek 8: Lost again, this time 16-17. So 16 points.\n\nWeek 9: They won, so not relevant.\n\nWeek 10: Lost to Atlanta Falcons, 21-35. Score is 21.\n\nWeek 11: Won in overtime against San Diego Chargers, 13-10. Not a loss.\n\nWeek 12: Lost to Oakland Raiders again, 10-17. Broncos scored 10.\n\nWeek 13: Won against Philadelphia Eagles, so no.\n\nWeek 14: Lost to Miami Dolphins, 13-14. Score is 13.\n\nSo looking at all the losses in 1975 (I assume this table is from that season), the highest points they scored in a loss are:\n\nLooking through each loss:\n- Week 3: 14\n- Week 4: 9\n- Week 6:13\n- Week 8:16\n- Week 10:21\n- Week 12:10\n- Week 14:13\n\nThe highest is 21 in week 10. So the claim says the most points they scored in a loss was 15, but according to this table, it's actually 21.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if this table is from 1975. The dates go up to December 14 and 20, which might be mid-late '75. So maybe that's correct.\n\nBut the claim says \"in 1975,\" so perhaps the highest loss points were higher than 15. Since the table shows a loss with 21 points, the claim is false because it claims 15 as the maximum when actually it was 21.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos' highest points scored in a loss was 15. However, according to the provided table, there was a game where they lost with 21 points. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco go in overtime only 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this claim is saying. It's about the Denver Broncos playing in overtime only twice during the 1975 season. So I need to check if the table shows that they played more than two overtime games or not.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a week of the season with various details like date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The key here is to find out how many times the Broncos played in overtime during 1975.\n\nWait, but looking at the 'result' column, it just shows the outcome, not whether it went into overtime. So maybe I'm missing something. Hmm, perhaps the term \"overtime\" refers to games that were decided in overtime. So a game result ending in overtime would have a specific notation, like \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\" as in week 11.\n\nSo I need to scan through each row's 'result' to see if it includes \"(ot)\" which indicates an overtime game. Let me go through the table:\n\n- Week 1: result is w 37 - 33\n- Week 2: w 23 - 13\n- Week 3: l 14 - 38\n- Week 4: l 9 - 20\n- Week 5: w 16 - 15\n- Week 6: l 13 - 26\n- Week 7: l 17 - 42\n- Week 8: l 16 - 17\n- Week 9: w 27 - 17\n- Week 10: l 21 - 35\n- Week 11: w 13 - 10 (ot)\n- Week 12: l 10 - 17\n- Week 13: w 25 - 10\n- Week 14: l 13 - 14\n\nFrom this, only week 11's result includes \"(ot)\", which means that was the only overtime game in the season. Therefore, the Broncos went into overtime only once, not twice.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 2 times\". Since there's only one overtime game, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Denver Broncos played only one overtime game during the 1975 season (week 11). Therefore, the claim stating they went into overtime only two times is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"in 1975, the Denver Bronco finish the season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. Let's break it down. The key points are:\n\n1. Year: 1975\n2. Team: Denver Broncos\n3. Season result: Finish the season (so probably their overall record for the year)\n4. Specific game location: Miami Orange Bowl\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a week of the season with details like opponent, date, result, game site, record, and attendance. The \"record\" column shows the team's wins and losses up to that week.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about finishing the entire season, not just a single week. So I need to check the overall performance for 1975. However, the table only goes up to week 14 of December 20, 1974 (since in the table, week 1 is September 21, and each week increments by a few days). Wait, hold on. The claim is about 1975, but the table seems to be from 2023 or later because it includes opponents like \"kansas city chiefs\" which are current teams. Hmm, that's confusing. \n\nWait, no, perhaps the table is hypothetical for a season in question, maybe not necessarily real. But let me think again. The claim is about 1975. So if the table is for the 2023 Broncos, then it doesn't relate to 1975 at all. But that can't be right because the table includes opponents like \"kansas city chiefs\" which are still around today, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check the dates in the table again. The earliest date is September 21, and it goes up to December 20, so that's a full season, likely from 2023 or 2024 because of current teams. So if the claim is about 1975, but the table is for a different year, perhaps I need to check whether the Broncos played in the Miami Orange Bowl in 1975.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't have any information about 1975. It's all within a single season, probably from 2023 or so, given the game sites like Mile High Stadium and others. So the claim is about 1975, which would be a different season altogether.\n\nSo maybe I need to check if in 1975, the Denver Broncos played at the Miami Orange Bowl and finished the season with a win there. But since the table doesn't have data from 1975, perhaps the answer is that it's false because the table doesn't support it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe the claim is referring to a game in week 14 against the Miami Dolphins at the Miami Orange Bowl, but looking at the table, there's no such week 14 in 1975. The table only goes up to week 14, which was December 20, but that's for a different year.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if the Broncos played at the Miami Orange Bowl in any game listed here. Looking through the \"game site\" column, there's one entry for the Miami Orange Bowl, which is against the Atlanta Falcons on November 23, 1974 (week 10). But that's not 1975, and it's a loss.\n\nBut the claim is about finishing the season in 1975 with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl. Since the table doesn't include any games from 1975, especially at the Miami Orange Bowl, I can infer that the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is supposed to represent a hypothetical season in 1975. But looking at the opponents and dates, it's clear they are modern teams playing in late 2023/early 2024, so not relevant to 1975.\n\nTherefore, since the table doesn't include any games from 1975 or the Miami Orange Bowl where the Broncos won, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
