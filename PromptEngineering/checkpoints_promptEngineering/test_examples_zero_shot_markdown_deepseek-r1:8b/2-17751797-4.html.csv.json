    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the score be 2 - 3 when the away team be liverpool on the date of 30 / 01 / 1991.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n- The score is 2 - 3.\n- The away team is Liverpool.\n- The match occurred on 30 / 01 / 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find a row where all three conditions are met. \n\nI notice that there are two possible scenarios because the table has both \"tie no\" and \"replay\" entries, which likely refer to the initial match and a replay. So, each tie number might have an initial game and possibly a replay.\n\nLet me go through each row step by step:\n\n1. Row 1: Tie No 1\n   - Home team: Liverpool\n   - Score: 2-2\n   - Away team: Brighton & Hove Albion\n   - Date: 26/01/1991\n   - This doesn't match because the away team is not Liverpool, and the score isn't 2-3.\n\n2. Row 2: Replay for Tie No 1\n   - Home team: Brighton & Hove Albion\n   - Score: 2-3\n   - Away team: Liverpool\n   - Date: 30/01/1991\n   - This matches all criteria. The away team is Liverpool, score is 2-3, and the date is correct.\n\nSince I found a matching row, the claim should be TRUE. However, to be thorough, I'll check other rows to ensure no other match meets these conditions.\n\nLooking through the rest of the table:\n\nRows 3-16 don't have any where the away team is Liverpool with a score of 2-3 on that specific date. The only match that fits is the replay for Tie No 1 on 30/01/1991, which confirms the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a football match is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"the score be 1 - 0 when the away team be bolton wanderer.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It seems like it's saying that in a match where Bolton Wanderers are the away team, the score was 1-0 in favor of their opponent.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. My task is to find any row where the away team is Bolton Wanderers and check if the score is 1-0.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Liverpool, away team is Brighton & Hove Albion. Score is 2-2. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Home team is Notts County, away team is Oldham Athletic. Score is 2-0. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Home team Crewe Alexandra vs Rotherham United. Score 1-0. Away team isn't Bolton Wanderers.\n\nRow 4: Luton Town vs West Ham United. Score 1-1. No.\n\nRow 5: Woking vs Everton. Score 0-1. Away team is Everton, not Bolton.\n\nRow 6: Shrewsbury Town vs Wimbledon. Score 1-0. Away team is Wimbledon.\n\nRow 7: Newcastle United vs Nottingham Forest. Score 2-2. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Tottenham Hotspur vs Oxford United. Score 4-2.\n\nRow 9: Coventry City vs Southampton. Score 1-1.\n\nRow10: Portsmouth vs Bournemouth. Score5-1.\n\nRow11: Manchester United vs Bolton Wanderers. Wait, here we go! Home team is Man U, away team is Bolton Wanderers. Score is 1-0. So this matches the claim exactly. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other rows with Bolton Wanderers as away team. Looking ahead:\n\nRow12: Norwich City vs Swindon Town.\n\nRow13: Millwall vs Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nRow14: Port Vale vs Manchester City.\n\nRow15: Arsenal vs Leeds United.\n\nThen replays for some matches, but those are additional games or perhaps rescheduled matches. I should focus on the initial matches where tie numbers are given (like 1-16) and not the replay rows which have 'replay' as tie number.\n\nIn row11, it's tie number5: away team is Bolton Wanderers, score is 0-1? Wait, no, let me check again. The table shows:\n\nRow11: woking                 | 0 - 1   | everton                | 27 / 01 / 1991\n\nWait, row11 is Woking vs Everton, so that's not Bolton Wanderers. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait no, let me recount the rows properly. Let me list all the away teams to see if any are Bolton Wanderers.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow1: Brighton & Hove\nRow2: Oldham Athletic\nRow3: Rotherham United\nRow4: West Ham United\nRow5: Everton\nRow6: Wimbledon\nRow7: Nottingham Forest\nRow8: Oxford United\nRow9: Southampton\nRow10: Bournemouth\nRow11: Bolton Wanderers (away team)\nRow12: Swindon Town\nRow13: Sheffield Wednesday\nRow14: Manchester City\nRow15: Leeds United\nRow16: Middlesbrough\n\nSo row11 is the only one where the away team is Bolton Wanderers. The score there is 0-1, not 1-0. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So in row11, home team Woking scored 0, away Everton? No, wait no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in row11, the tie number is 5, home team is woking, score is 0 - 1, away team is everton. So not Bolton Wanderers. Wait, then where does Bolton Wanderers appear?\n\nLooking back, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each row properly:\n\nRow1: away team is Brighton\nRow2: Oldham\nRow3: Rotherham\nRow4: West Ham\nRow5: Everton\nRow6: Wimbledon\nRow7: Forest\nRow8: Oxford\nRow9: Southampton\nRow10: Bournemouth\nRow11: Bolton Wanderers as away team? Wait, no. Let me check row11 again.\n\nWait, the table shows:\n\n| 5        | woking                 | 0 - 1   | everton                | 27 / 01 / 1991 |\nSo row11's home team is Woking, away team is Everton, score 0-1.\n\nLooking further down, row12: away team is Swindon Town.\n\nWait, did any of the matches have Bolton Wanderers as the away team? Because in my initial scan, I thought row11 was Bolton, but upon closer look, it's not. Maybe I misread. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nRow1: Home: Liverpool, Away: Brighton\nRow2: Notts County vs Oldham\nRow3: Crewe Alexandra vs Rotherham\nRow4: Luton vs West Ham\nRow5: Woking vs Everton\nRow6: Shrewsbury vs Wimbledon\nRow7: Newcastle vs Forest\nRow8: Tottenham vs Oxford\nRow9: Coventry vs Southampton\nRow10: Portsmouth vs Bournemouth\nRow11: Man U vs Bolton Wanderers? No, row11 is woking vs everton.\n\nWait, I must have confused rows. Let me list all away teams:\n\n1. Brighton\n2. Oldham\n3. Rotherham\n4. West Ham\n5. Everton\n6. Wimbledon\n7. Forest\n8. Oxford\n9. Southampton\n10. Bournemouth\n11. Bolton Wanderers? No, row11 is Woking vs Everton.\n\nWait then when does Bolton Wanderers appear as away team?\n\nLooking at the rest of the rows:\n\nRow12: Norwich vs Swindon Town (away team is Swindon)\nRow13: Millwall vs Sheffield Wed (Sheffield Wed as away)\nRow14: Port Vale vs Man City\nRow15: Arsenal vs Leeds United (Leeds as away)\nRow16: Middlesbrough as away.\n\nSo perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe there are no matches where Bolton Wanderers are the away team in this table.\n\nWait, but row11 is Woking vs Everton, so maybe I missed that. Let me check if any other rows have Bolton Wanderers.\n\nLooking through all the 'away' teams:\n\n- Row1: Brighton\n- Row2: Oldham\n- Row3: Rotherham\n- Row4: West Ham\n- Row5: Everton\n- Row6: Wimbledon\n- Row7: Forest\n- Row8: Oxford\n- Row9: Southampton\n- Row10: Bournemouth\n- Row11: ?\nWait, in row11 the home team is Woking, away team is Everton.\n\nSo perhaps I was mistaken. Maybe the only time Bolton Wanderers is an away team is somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a match where Bolton Wanderers are the home team and scored 1-0, but that's not what the claim says. The claim specifically mentions the away team as Bolton Wanderers with a 1-0 score.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at row11: woking | 0 -1 | everton\n\nSo in this match, Woking is home, Everton is away, score is 0-1. So not matching.\n\nIs there any other row where Bolton Wanderers are away?\n\nI don't see it in the list I made earlier. So perhaps the claim is FALSE because there's no such match in the table.\n\nWait but let me double-check to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table has more rows beyond 16, but looking at the provided data, it goes up to tie number16.\n\nSo in all these matches, I don't see any where the away team is Bolton Wanderers with a score of 1-0. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if there's a match where the away team is Bolton Wanderers and the score is 1-0 based on the provided table. After examining each row, no such match exists.\n\nAnswer: **FALSE**",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the score be 2 - 2 when the away team be brighton and heave albion.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: the score and the away team. The score mentioned is 2-2, and the away team is Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any matches where the away team is Brighton & Hove Albion and the score is 2-2. \n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. Row 1: tie no 1. Home team is Liverpool, score is 2-2, away team is Brighton. So this seems to match both the score and the away team.\n\nWait, but there's a replay for tie no 1 (row 2) where Brighton scores 2-3 against Liverpool. That doesn't fit 2-2. So only row 1 fits both criteria.\n\nAnother thing: Sometimes the same teams can have multiple matches. I should check all rows to see if any other instance meets these conditions, but from a quick scan:\n\nRow 4 is Luton vs West Ham with a score of 1-1, not 2-2.\nReplay in row 6 (West Ham 5-0 Luton) doesn't fit.\nLooking through the rest, I don't see another instance where the away team is Brighton and the score is 2-2 except for row 1.\n\nWait, but in row 1, it's tie no 1, home is Liverpool. So when the away team is Brighton, they played against Liverpool with a 2-2 score. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where the away team is Brighton and the score is 2-2. From the table, I don't see another instance beyond row 1. \n\nSo based on this, the claim is supported by row 1's data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by the match in row 1 where the away team was Brighton & Hove Albion and the score was 2-2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the score be 1 - 0 when the home team be shrewsbury town.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: the home team and the score. The home team should be Shrewsbury Town, and the score should be 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to search for rows where the \"home team\" is Shrewsbury Town. From the table, I see that there are a few entries:\n\n- Row 6: Home team is Shrewsbury Town vs Wimbledon. The score is 1 - 0.\n- Then, looking further down, I see other matches, but they might be replays or different home teams.\n\nWait, let me check each row. \n\nRow 6 has \"shrewsbury town\" as the home team and a score of 1-0 against Wimbledon. That's one match. Are there any other Shrewsbury Town matches in the table?\n\nLooking through the rows, I see that Row 14 is Port Vale vs Manchester City, Row 15 and onwards are Arsenal and Leeds United, so no more Shrewsbury Town.\n\nSo, for the home team part of the claim, we have at least one row where the home team is Shrewsbury Town with a score of 1-0. That seems to fit.\n\nNow, checking if there's only that one instance. Since the claim doesn't specify anything else about the match (like date or away team), just that the score was 1-0 when they were the home team, it's sufficient because there is such a row in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there exists at least one match where Shrewsbury Town was the home team with a 1-0 score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 5: Home team is Woking vs. Everton. The score here is 0 - 1.\n- Then, checking further down, there's a replay for Woking in another row? Wait, no, looking back, I see that the home teams are listed with their respective matches. So, only one entry for Woking as the home team.\n\nSo, the tie number for Woking is 5, and the score is indeed 0 - 1. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The tie no column has '5' for Woking's match, and the score column shows '0 - 1'.

The claim is: \"1 - 0 be the score when the home team be wimbledon.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions a score of \"1 - 0\" and specifies that this occurs when Wimbledon is the home team.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents either a regular match or a replay. Each row has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, date.\n\nI'll start by searching for any rows where the home team is Wimbledon. I'll scan through each row's home team column:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is liverpool \u2192 Not Wimbledon.\n2. Row 1: Home team is brighton & hove albion \u2192 No.\n3. Row 2: notts county \u2192 No.\n4. Row 3: crewe alexandra \u2192 No.\n5.

Row 14: port vale \u2192 No.\n16. Rows 15-17 are replays, so I'll check those too:\n   - Row 15: home team is arsenal \u2192 No.\n   - Row 16: home team is cambridge united \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the rows have Wimbledon as the home team. Wait, did I miss any? Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Looking again at each row's home team column:\n  - Row 0 to 17 don't list Wimbledon in the home team column. So, there are no matches where Wimbledon is the home team.\n\nSince the claim states that \"1 - 0 be the score when the home team be wimbledon,\" and there are no such matches in the table, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant to support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be those where Wimbledon is the home team because the claim refers to that specific condition. However, since none of the rows have Wimbledon as the home team, these cells don't exist in the table.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I should list the cells that are relevant regardless of whether they support or contradict the claim. So even if there's no match where Wimbledon is the home team with a 1-0 score, those rows (if any) would be relevant because they're tied to Wimbledon as home.\n\nBut in this case, since there are no such rows, the relevant cells list will be empty because none of the data supports the claim. Therefore, I don't need to include any cells because there's nothing to check against. Alternatively, if the table had a row where Wimbledon was the home team with a 1-0 score, those would be the relevant cells.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim is FALSE because there are no matches in the table where Wimbledon is the home team with a 1-0 score. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE\" and since there are no relevant cells (as none of the rows meet the condition), I'll return an empty list for relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Also, this should occur on or after 30 January 1991.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list football matches with columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date.

So, the home team is Manchester United, not Bolton.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me double-check. In tie no11: Home team is manchester united, score 1-0, away team bolton wanderers. So the home team isn't Bolton; they're the visitors here. So that doesn't match the claim where the home team is Bolton Wanderers.\n\nContinuing:\n\nTie no12: Norwich vs Swindon. No.\n\nTie no13: Millwall vs Sheffield Wednesday. Score 4-4, then replay. Not relevant.\n\nTie no14: Port Vale vs Manchester City. Home team Port Vale, score 1-2. No.\n\nTie no15: Arsenal vs Leeds. Home team Arsenal, score 0-0.\n\nReplay: Leeds and Arsenal draw again. But the original tie no15 has home team as Arsenal, so not Bolton.\n\nThen there are more replays for ties 15 and 16 involving Arsenal and Leeds, but those aren't relevant either.\n\nTie no16: Cambridge United vs Middlesbrough. No match.\n\nWait, did I miss any row where the home team is Bolton Wanderers? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: liverpool vs brighton\n\nRow1: brighton replay vs liverpool\n\nRow2: notts county\n\nRow3: crewe alexandra\n\nRow4: luton town\n\nRow5: woking vs everton\n\nRow6: shrewsbury\n\nRow7: newcastle\n\nRow8: tottenham\n\nRow9: coventry city\n\nRow10: portsmouth\n\nRow11: manchester united vs bolton wanderers (away team)\n\nWait, so in tie no11, the away team is Bolton Wanderers. The home team is Manchester United.\n\nSo, is there any row where the home team is Bolton Wanderers?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nI don't see any row with \"bolton wanderer\" as the home team. The only mention of Bolton is as an away team in tie no11 and maybe others, but not as a home team.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the score is 1-0 for the home team being Bolton Wanderers isn't found in the table. There's no row where the home team is Bolton with a 1-0 score against them.\n\nSo, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row of the provided table for matches where the home team is Bolton Wanderers and the score is 1-0. None of the rows meet both conditions. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is not supported by the provided data, making it false.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that in the fifth tie (tie number 5), the home team was Woking and the away team was someone else, but looking at the table, I need to see if that matches.\n\nWait, actually, the structure is a bit different. The table has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, date. Each row represents either a normal tie or a replay. So for tie number 5, I should look up row where \"tie no\" is 5.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow with tie no 5 says:\n- home team: woking\n- score: 0 - 1\n- away team: everton\n\nSo in this case, the home team is Woking and the away team is Everton. So the claim says \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" Wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nI think the claim is trying to say that in tie number 5, the away team was Woking. But according to the table, in tie number 5, the home team was Woking, and the away team was Everton. So if the claim is that in tie 5, the away team was Woking, that would be incorrect because the away team was Everton.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the wording of the claim. The user wrote it as \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" Maybe they mean that in tie number 5, the home team is Woking and the away team is someone else, but then the next part isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is asserting that in a specific tie (maybe not necessarily 5), when the away team was Woking, it was tie number 5. But I think the exact wording is \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" So perhaps it's saying that tie number 5 occurred before the away team being Woking in some other context.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for rows where the away team was Woking. Scanning through:\n\n- Tie 1: home is liverpool vs brighton\n- Tie 2: notts county vs oldham\n- Tie3: crewe vs rotherham\n- Tie4: luton vs west ham\n- Tie5: woking vs everton\n- Tie6: shrewsbury vs wimbledon\n- Tie7: newcastle vs nottingham forest\n- Tie8: tottenham vs oxford\n- Tie9: coventry vs southampton\n- Tie10: portsmouth vs bournemouth\n- Tie11: manchester united vs bolton\n- Tie12: norwich vs swindon\n- Tie13: millwall vs sheffield wednesday\n- Tie14: port vale vs manchester city\n- Tie15: arsenal vs leeds\n- Then there are replays for some ties.\n\nLooking through the away teams, I see that in tie 5, the home team is Woking and the away is Everton. So where else does Woking appear as the away team? Let me check each row:\n\nLooking for \"woking\" in the 'away team' column:\n\n- Tie5: woking is home team\n- Any others? No, I don't see another entry where away team is woking.\n\nSo if the claim is that tie number 5 was when Woking was the away team, that's incorrect because in tie 5, Woking was the home team. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The claim says \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" Maybe it's implying that tie number 5 occurred after Woking became the away team? But in the table, Woking is only the home team in tie 5 and nowhere else as away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that in a tie numbered 5, the home team was someone and the away was woking. But according to the table, tie 5's away team is Everton, not Woking.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because in tie number 5, Woking was the home team, not the away team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in tie number 5, the away team was Woking. However, upon reviewing the table, it's clear that in tie number 5, the home team was Woking against Everton as the away team. Since Woking is listed as the home team for tie 5 and not the away team, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The user claims that tie number 5 had Woking as the away team.\n2. **Locate Tie Number 5 in the Table:** Find the row where \"tie no\" is 5.\n3. **Analyze Home and Away Teams for Tie 5:** The home team is Woking, and the away team is Everton.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Woking was the home team in tie 5, not the away team, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is incorrect because in tie number 5, Woking was the home team, not the away team.\n\n\\boxed{false}",
