    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"kweku adoboli work for ubs in london, united kingdom.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find the row corresponding to Kweku Adoboli. Let me scan through the rows:\n\n1. Yasuo Hamanaka\n2. Kweku Adoboli\n3. Nick Leeson\n4. Toshihide Iguchi\n5. Boris Picano - Nacci\n6. John Rusnak\n\nYes, Kweku Adoboli is row 2.\n\nNow, I need to look at the columns that might be relevant. The claim mentions \"work for\" so I should check the 'institution' column and possibly the 'country' column to confirm the location.\n\nLooking at row 2, the 'name' is Kweku Adoboli, country is London, United Kingdom, date (s) is 2011, loss is 2.3 billion, institution is UBS, market activity includes S&P 500, DAX, and Eurostoxx futures, and sentence is 7 years in prison.\n\nSo, the 'institution' column says \"ubs\" which stands for Union Bank of Switzerland, a major Swiss bank. However, Kweku Adoboli was working in London, as per the country column. But I'm wondering if that's correct because sometimes companies have offices in multiple countries. So UBS is based in Switzerland but has branches elsewhere.\n\nWait, the claim says he worked for UBS in London. From the table, it's clear that his institution is UBS and his location is London, UK. So yes, he did work for UBS in London, as per the table.\n\nI should also check if there's any discrepancy between the 'country' and 'institution'. Since UBS is a Swiss bank but has operations in London, it makes sense that Kweku Adoboli worked there in London.\n\nSo all relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index: 2 (since he's row 2)\n- column_name: institution\n- column_name: country\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as the table confirms that Kweku Adoboli worked for UBS in London.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
