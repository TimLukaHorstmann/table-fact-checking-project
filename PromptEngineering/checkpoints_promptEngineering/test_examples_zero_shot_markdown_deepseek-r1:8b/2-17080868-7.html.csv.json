    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"minnesota have an attendance of 11921 at the target center.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to specific columns in the table. The claim mentions \"attendance\" and \"target center,\" so those are two key points. In the table, the relevant columns for attendance would be \"location attendance,\" but looking closely, it seems like each row has a single value under \"location attendance.\" So I need to check if Minnesota's game was played at Target Center with an attendance of 11921.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The first row (game 35) is about Minnesota and their game details on January 2nd. The location for this game is \"target center\" with an attendance of 11921. \n\nSo, I should check if the team in that row is Minnesota and the location matches Target Center with the correct attendance. From the table, game 35 has all those specifics: team is Minnesota, date is January 2nd, location is Target Center, and attendance is indeed 11921.\n\nTherefore, this data fully supports the claim. So, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones for game 35 where Minnesota played at Target Center with an attendance of 11921.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
