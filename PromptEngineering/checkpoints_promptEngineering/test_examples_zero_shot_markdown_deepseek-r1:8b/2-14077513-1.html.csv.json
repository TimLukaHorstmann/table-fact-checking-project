    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"there be 0 drawn for 7 game with 4 loss , 19 - 19 point differential and 6 point\". Let me break this down into parts to check against the table.\n\nStarting with \"0 drawn\": Looking at the 'drawn' column in the table. Each row has a number, so I need to find rows where 'drawn' is 0. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: drawn=1\n- Row 1: drawn=4\n- Row 2: drawn=1\n- Row 3: drawn=2\n- Row 4: drawn=1\n- Row 5: drawn=0 \u2192 This is one.\n- Row 6: drawn=0 \u2192 Another.\n- Row 7: drawn=1\n\nSo, there are two rows where 'drawn' is 0. That means the claim's assertion of \"0 drawn\" is not accurate because it should be 2 instances, not 0.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. The claim says \"there be 0 drawn for 7 games\", which might mean that across all 7 games, total drawn is 0. But in the table, each game has a 'drawn' value, and the sum of 'drawn' per game would actually be more than 0 since multiple rows have non-zero values. However, the wording isn't entirely clear. It could mean per game or overall. If it's per game, then indeed some games have 0 drawn, but others don't. So the claim seems incorrect either way.\n\nNext, \"7 games with 4 loss\": Looking at the 'lost' column for each row. Let's check if any row has a 'lost' value of 4.\n\n- Row 0: lost=0\n- Row 1: lost=0\n- Row 2: lost=2\n- Row 3: lost=2\n- Row 4: lost=3\n- Row 5: lost=6\n- Row 6: lost=6\n- Wait, no row has 'lost' equal to 4. So that part is also incorrect.\n\nThen, \"19 - 19 point differential\": Looking for a row where points difference is exactly 19 - 19, which is 0. Scanning the 'points difference' column:\n\n- Row 0: 41-16=25\n- Row 1:30-21=9\n- Row2:24-20=4\n- Row3:23-28=-5\n- Row4:22-15=7\n- Row5:19-19=0 \u2192 Here it is, row5.\n- Row6:13-26=-13\n- Row7:13-40=-27\n\nSo only row5 has a points difference of 0. That part checks out.\n\nLastly, \"6 point\": Looking for the 'points' column where the value is 6. Checking each row:\n\n- Row0:13\n- Row1:10\n- Row2:9\n- Row3:8\n- Row4:7\n- Row5:6 \u2192 Found here.\n- Row6:2\n- Row7:1\n\nYes, row5 has points=6.\n\nSo summarizing the claim's parts:\n\n- 0 drawn: Incorrect (there are 2 rows with 0 drawn)\n- 7 games with 4 loss: Incorrect (no game has 4 losses)\n- 19 -19 point diff: Correct (row5)\n- 6 points: Correct (row5)\n\nSince two of the four parts are incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes inaccuracies regarding the number of drawn games and losses. Only the points differential and points align with a specific row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
