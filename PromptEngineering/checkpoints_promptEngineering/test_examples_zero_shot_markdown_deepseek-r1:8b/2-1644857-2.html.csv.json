    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Scotland be the country that have stolen end less than 9 and a Craig Brown as the skip.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. Scotland has stolen ends less than 9.\n2. The skip for Scotland is Craig Brown.\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a country and various statistics. The columns relevant here are \"stolen ends\" and \"skip.\" \n\nStarting with the first part: stolen ends less than 9 for Scotland.\n\nIn the table, for Scotland (row index 1), under \"stolen ends,\" the value is 10. Wait, that's not less than 9. So that part of the claim seems to be incorrect because 10 is greater than 9. \n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe I misread it. Let me count again: for Scotland, stolen ends are 10. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow the second part: the skip for Scotland is Craig Brown. Looking at the table, under \"skip,\" Scotland has David Murdoch as the skip. So that doesn't match either.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim don't hold true based on the table data. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm looking at the right columns and rows. The \"stolen ends\" column for each country is indeed listed after \"ends lost.\" For Scotland, it's 10, which is more than 9. And the skip is David Murdoch, not Craig Brown. So both conditions are not met.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}]}",
