The claim is: \"the power plant located at ramakkalmedu has a total capacity (MWE) of 25.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate the row in the table where the location is ramakkalmedu. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first few rows have locations like satara district, kanyakumari, kayathar, etc.\n2. Then I see a row where the location is \"ramakkalmedu\" under the \"location\" column. Scanning down, yes, there's an entry for ramakkalmedu in the 4th row.\n\nNow, I check the total capacity (MWE) corresponding to this location. The number next to ramakkalmedu is 25. \n\nSo, the claim says that the power plant at ramakkalmedu has a total capacity of 25 MWE. According to the table, it matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches the data in the table for \"ramakkalmedu\" location with a total capacity of 25 MW.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"total capacity (mwe)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the chennai mohan power plant be produced by the mohan breweries & distilleries ltd company.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the specific row in the table where the power plant is \"chennai mohan\". Scanning through the table, I see that the seventh entry from the top is \"chennai mohan\" under \"producer\", which is listed as \"mohan breweries & distilleries ltd\". \n\nWait, let me double-check. The table has several entries. The row for \"chennai mohan\" shows that the producer is indeed \"mohan breweries & distilleries ltd\". So, this matches exactly with the claim.\n\nBut I should make sure there are no other entries or conflicting information. Scanning further, another entry like \"shah gajendragarh\" has two producers listed, but that's a different power plant. Also, checking for any typos in names, everything seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"producer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the poolavadi power plant be produced by the chettinad cement corp, ltd.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row that corresponds to \"poolavadi.\" Scanning through the table, I see a row with \"poolavadi chettinad\" in the power plant column. That's probably it.\n\nNext, I need to check who the producer is for this power plant. The table lists \"chettinad cement corp ltd\" as the producer in that specific row.\n\nSo, the claim matches the table exactly. There\u2019s no discrepancy or missing information here. \n\nNow, about the relevant cells: the claim references two entities\u2014the power plant name and the producer.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"25 be the total capacity (mwe) at the power plant located in cape comorin.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n1. Total capacity is 25 MW.\n2. The power plant is located in Cape Comorin.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different power plant with various details like producer, location, state, and total capacity.\n\nI need to find the row where the location is Cape Comorin and check what the total capacity is for that specific power plant. \n\nNow, scanning through the table:\n- The first few rows are about wind parks and other facilities. I notice that in the table, each row has the following columns: power plant name, producer, location, state, and total capacity (mwe).\n\nLooking specifically for \"cape comorin\" in the location column:\n\nI go down each row until I find a match. Let's see:\n- Row 0: van kusawade wind park\n- Row1: cape comorin \u2013 this is the one!\n- Then there are other rows, but focusing on Row1.\n\nNow, for Row1, the power plant is \"cape comorin.\" The producer is aban loyd chiles offshore ltd, located in tamil nadu, and the state is tamil nadu. The total capacity is 33 MW.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says the capacity is 25 MW, but here it's 33. That doesn't match. So the total capacity at Cape Comorin is 33 MW, not 25. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo to support this conclusion, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that confirm the location and capacity for Cape Comorin.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about the power plant's total capacity at Cape Comorin is TRUE or FALSE, we first locate the row corresponding to \"cape comorin\" in the table. The row shows a total capacity of 33 MW instead of the claimed 25 MW.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"total capacity (mwe)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"bs be the company that be the producer at the poolavadi location.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is stating that a company named \"BS\" is the producer located at \"Poolavadi\". So, looking for \"BS\" as the producer and \"Poolavadi\" as the location.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any row where both these conditions are met. The table has several columns: power plant name, producer, location, state, and total capacity.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. vankusawade wind park - Suzlon Energy Ltd, Satara district, Maharashtra. Producer is Suzlon, not BS. Location is Satara, not Poolavadi.\n2. cape comorin - Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Ltd, Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Aban Loyd, not BS. Location is Kanyakumari.\n3. kayathar subhash - Subhash Ltd, Kayathar, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Subhash, location is Kayathar.\n4. ramakkalmedu - Subhash Ltd, Ramakkalmedu, Kerala. Producer is Subhash.\n5. muppandal wind - Muppandal Wind Farm, Muppandal, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Muppandal.\n6. gudimangalam - Gudimangalam Wind Farm, Gudimangalam, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Gudimangalam.\n7. puthlur rci - WesCare (India) Ltd, Puthlur, Andhra Pradesh. Producer is WesCare.\n8. lamda danida - Danida India Ltd, Lamba, Gujarat. Producer is Danida.\n9. chennai mohan - Mohan Breweries & Distilleries Ltd, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Mohan.\n10. jamgudrani mp - MP Wind Farms Ltd, Dewas, Madhya Pradesh. Producer is MP Wind Farms.\n11. jogmatti bses - BSES Ltd, Chitradurga district, Karnataka. Producer is BSES.\n12. perungudi newam - Newam Power Company Ltd, Perungudi, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Newam.\n13. kethanur wind farm - Kethanur Wind Farm, Kethanur, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Kethanur.\n14. hyderabad apsrtc - Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Producer is APSC.\n15. muppandal madras - Madras Cements Ltd, Muppandal, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Madras.\n16. shah gajendragarh - MMTCL, Gadag, Karnataka.

Producer is Chettinad.\n20. shalivahana wind - Shalivahana Green Energy Ltd, Tirupur, Tamil Nadu. Producer is Shalivahana.\n21. dangiri wind farm - Oil India Ltd, Jaiselmer, Rajasthan. Producer is Oil India.\n\nAfter going through all rows, I see that the only row related to \"Poolavadi\" is row 19: poolavadi chettinad. The producer for this row is Chettinad Cement Corp Ltd. There's no entry where the producer is \"BS\" at Poolavadi location. Therefore, the claim that \"BS be the company that be the producer at the poolavadi location\" is not supported by the table.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"producer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"mmtcl be the company known as the producer at the kethanur location.\" So, I need to check each part of this statement against the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts: \n1. The producer is MMTCL.\n2. This producer is associated with the Kethanur location.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for cells related to Kethanur and see which producers are listed there. From the table, under \"producer,\" I need to find all entries where the location is Kethanur.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Van kushade wind park, Suzlon Energy Ltd, Satara district, Maharashtra.\n- Row 2: Cape Comorin, Aban Loyd Chiles offshore ltd, Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 3: Kayathar Subhash, Subhash Ltd, Kayathar, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 4: Ramakkalmedu, Subhash Ltd, Kerala.\n- Row 5: Muppandal wind, Muppandal Wind Farm, Muppandal, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 6: Gudimangalam, Gudimangalam Wind Farm, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 7: Puthlur RCI, Wescare (India) Ltd, Andhra Pradesh.\n- Row 8: Lamda Danida, Danida India Ltd, Gujarat.\n- Row 9: Chennai Mohan, Mohan Breweries & Distilleries Ltd, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 10: Jamgudrani MP, MP Windfarms Ltd, Dewas, Madhya Pradesh.\n- Row 11: Jogmatti BSES, BS E Ltd, Chitradurga district, Karnataka.\n- Row 12: Perungudi Newam, Newam Power Company Ltd, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 13: Kethanur wind farm, Kethanur Wind Farm, Kethanur, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 14: Hyderabad APSRTC, Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.\n- Row 15: Muppandal Madras, Madras Cements Ltd, Muppandal, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 16: Shah Gajendragarh, MMTCL, Gadag, Karnataka.\n- Row 17: Shah Gajendragarh, Sanjay D Ghodawat, Gadag, Karnataka.\n- Row 18: Acciona Tuppadahalli, Tuppadahalli Energy India Pvt Ltd, Chitradurga district, Karnataka.\n- Row 19: Poolavadi Chettinad, Chettinad Cement Corp Ltd, Poolavadi, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 20: Shalivahana Wind, Shalivahana Green Energy Ltd, Tirupur, Tamil Nadu.\n- Row 21: Dangiri Wind Farm, Oil India Ltd, Jaiselmer, Rajasthan.\n\nFrom this, the Kethanur location is in row 13. The producer for that entry is \"Kethanur wind farm.\" Now, looking through other rows, I see another Shah Gajendragarh entry with MMTCL as the producer and location Gadag, Karnataka. So, MMTCL is a producer at Gadag, not Kethanur.\n\nNow, checking the claim: It says MMTCL is the producer at Kethanur. From row 13, the producer is Kethanur wind farm, which is different from MMTCL. Therefore, the claim is false because MMTCL isn't listed as the producer for Kethanur in the table.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the ones where location is Kethanur (row 13) and the producer column.
