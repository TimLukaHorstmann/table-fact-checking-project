    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"pittsburgh be the visitor for the game with more than 24 points and have an attendance of 14995.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts: \n1. Pittsburgh being the visitor in a game where their score was more than 24 points.\n2. The attendance at that specific game is exactly 14,995.\n\nTo verify this, I need to look through each row of the table and find where these conditions are met.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding games where the visitor is Pittsburgh AND their score is over 24. I'll go through each row:\n\n- December 1: Visitor is Detroit, so no.\n- December 4: Visitor is NY Rangers, no.\n- December 5: Visitor is Pittsburgh. Their score is 3 - 5, which is 3 points. That's not more than 24.\n- December 8: Visitor is California, no.\n- December 11: Visitor is Buffalo, no.\n- December 12: Visitor is Pittsburgh again, but their score is 1 - 6 = 1 point. Still low.\n- December 15: Visitor is Toronto, no.\n- December 18: Visitor is Boston, no.\n- December 19: Visitor is Pittsburgh with a score of 2 - 2, which is 2 points. Not enough.\n- December 22: Visitor is NY Rangers, no.\n- December 25: Visitor is Montreal, no.\n- December 26: Visitor is Philadelphia, no.\n- December 28: Visitor is Toronto, no.\n- December 31: Visitor is Buffalo, no.\n\nWait a minute, I didn't find any games where Pittsburgh is the visitor with more than 24 points. That's odd. Did I miss something? Let me double-check each row to make sure.\n\nLooking again at December 26: The home team is Philadelphia, so visitor is Pittsburgh, but their score is 1 - 6, which equals 1 point. Still not over 24.\n\nHmm, maybe the claim is incorrect because there are no such games where Pittsburgh as the visitor scored more than 24 points.\n\nNow, looking at the second part: attendance of 14,995. I need to check if any game where Pittsburgh was the visitor had exactly that number.\n\nFrom the table, I see:\n\n- December 19: Attendance is 14,995, and the visitor is Pittsburgh. Their score was 2 - 2, which is 2 points. So the attendance matches, but their score isn't over 24.\n\nIs there another game where they were visitors with both high attendance and high score? From my initial check, no such row exists. Therefore, the claim has two issues: first, there's no game where Pittsburgh as a visitor scored more than 24 points, and second, even if there was, the attendance would need to match.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because both conditions aren't met in any of the games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Pittsburgh was the visitor in a game with over 24 points and an attendance of 14,995. Checking each row, no such game exists where these conditions are both satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "pittsburgh be the montreal visit with more than 24 point and 14995 attendee after december 19",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"pittsburgh be the montreal visit with more than 24 point and 14995 attendee after december 19.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this claim is saying. It's talking about a game where Pittsburgh is playing against Montreal. After December 19, there should have been a game where Pittsburgh had more than 24 points and the attendance was exactly 14,995.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all the games after December 19. So, the dates after December 19 are December 22, December 25, December 26, December 28, and December 31. \n\nNow, let me go through each of these dates one by one and check if Pittsburgh scored more than 24 points and if attendance was 14,995.\n\nStarting with December 22: The game is against NY Rangers. Pittsburgh's score is 2 - 4, which is 2 points. That's less than 24, so it doesn't meet the criteria. Attendance is 17,250, not 14,995 either.\n\nNext, December 25: Opponent is Montreal. Score for Pittsburgh is 2 - 4, so 2 points again. Not enough. Attendance here is 7,778, which is way below 14,995.\n\nMoving on to December 26: Pittsburgh is playing Philadelphia. Their score is 1 - 6, totaling 1 point. Not meeting the points requirement. Attendance is 14,626, close but not exactly 14,995.\n\nThen December 28: Against Toronto. Score is 4 - 2 for Pittsburgh, so 4 points. Attendance is 11,158. Neither matches what's needed.\n\nLastly, December 31: Buffalo visitors. Pittsburgh scores 3 - 3, which is 3 points. Not enough. Attendance is 7,908, not matching.\n\nWait a minute, I just realized that the claim mentions \"pittsburgh be the montreal visit.\" So, it should specifically be when Pittsburgh is playing against Montreal. Looking back at the table, December 25 is the only game where Pittsburgh plays Montreal after December 19.\n\nIn that game, as I saw earlier, Pittsburgh scored 2 points and attendance was 7,778. That doesn't meet both conditions: more than 24 points and exactly 14,995 attendees.\n\nWait again, maybe I misread the table columns. Let me check each relevant column for each row after December 19. The columns we need to check are \"visitor\", \"score\", \"attendance\". \n\nFor December 22:\n- Visitor: Buffalo (so it's not Montreal)\n- Score: 3 - 3 = 3 points\n- Attendance: 7,908\n\nDecember 25:\n- Visitor: Montreal\n- Score: 2 - 4 = 2 points\n- Attendance: 7,778\n\nSo, in this case, the only time Pittsburgh plays Montreal after December 19 is on December 25. But their score was 2 and attendance was less than required.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"pittsburgh be the montreal visit with more than 24 points and 14995 attendee.\" So it's not just about being a Montreal game, but in that specific game, Pittsburgh must have scored over 24 and attendance exactly 14,995. \n\nLooking through all games after December 19 where Pittsburgh is the home team (since it says \"montreal visit\", so maybe the perspective is from Montreal visiting Pittsburgh?), let's see if any of them have the required points and attendance.\n\nWait, actually, the claim might be phrased as Pittsburgh hosting Montreal, but I need to check all games after December 19 where the visitor is Montreal. But in the table, December 25 is the only game where Pittsburgh hosts Montreal.\n\nIn that game:\n- Visitor: Montreal\n- Score: 2 - 4 (so Pittsburgh's score is 2)\n- Attendance: 7,778\n\nNeither meets the criteria. Therefore, there's no such game after December 19 where Pittsburgh plays against Montreal with more than 24 points and exactly 14,995 attendees.\n\nSo the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that after December 19, there was a game where Pittsburgh played Montreal with over 24 points and an attendance of 14,995. Reviewing the table, no such game exists as both conditions aren't met in any relevant match. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
