    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"tie no 8 be with the away team , wrexham.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this means. The claim seems to state that in tie number 8, the away team is Wrexham. So, I need to look at the table and find the entry for tie number 8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"tie no\" column, which indicates the match number. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Tie 1: Chesterfield vs Nottingham Forest\n- Tie 2: Leicester City vs Chelsea\n- Tie 3: Derby County vs Coventry City\n- Tie 4: Manchester City vs Middlesbrough\n- Tie 5: Bradford City vs Sheffield Wednesday\n- Tie 6: Wimbledon vs Queens Park Rangers\n- Tie 7: Leeds United vs Portsmouth\n- Tie 8: Birmingham City vs Wrexham\n\nWait, tie 8 is \"Birmingham city | 1 - 3 | wrexham.\" So the away team for tie 8 is indeed Wrexham. That seems to support the claim.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the table structure. The relevant columns are:\n\n- tie no (which is the row index)\n- home team\n- away team\n\nSo, for tie 8, both the away team column and the tie no column are relevant because they directly relate to the claim.\n\nPutting it all together: the claim is TRUE because Wrexham is listed as the away team in tie number 8. The relevant cells are row index 8 for both the home and away team columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the \"tie no\" column for 8, which shows that the away team is indeed Wrexham.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"chelsea be the away team , when they play leicester city\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Chelsea should be the away team when they play Leicester City. So, I'm looking for a match-up between Chelsea and Leicester City where Chelsea is listed as the away team.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row represents a different game. \n\nI need to go through each row and check if there's any instance where Chelsea is the away team against Leicester City. Let me start by looking at each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Chesterfield, away is Nottingham Forest. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Home is Leicester City, away is Chelsea. So here, Chelsea is the away team, and they're playing Leicester City as the home team. That seems to fit the claim.\nWait, but in this row, the tie number is 2, date 16 Feb 1997. But let me check if there's a replay or any other instance where they play again.\n\nRow 3: Home is Chelsea, away is Leicester City. So here, Chelsea is home and Leicester is away. That doesn't fit because the claim says Chelsea should be away.\nRow 4: Not relevant.\nRow 5: Not relevant.\nRow 6: Not relevant.\nRow 7: Not relevant.\nRow 8: Not relevant.\n\nSo in row 2, Chelsea is the away team against Leicester City (home). That seems to support the claim. But wait, I should check if there's any other instance where they play each other. Specifically, looking for when Chelsea is away.\n\nIn row 3, it's Chelsea vs Leicester City again, but Chelsea is home in that case. So that doesn't fit the claim because the claim says Chelsea is away.\n\nSo only row 2 matches the condition where Chelsea is away against Leicester City. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the scores to make sure there's no confusion. Row 2: Leicester City (home) vs Chelsea (away), score 2-2. That seems correct.\n\nSo yes, Chelsea was indeed the away team when they played Leicester City on 16 February 1997.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one instance where Chelsea is listed as the away team against Leicester City in row 2 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the home team be leeds united and the away team be portsmouth.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. It has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row represents a match between a home team and an away team with their respective scores and attendance details.\n\nThe claim is about two specific teams: Leeds United as the home team and Portsmouth as the away team. So I need to check if there's any tie where this pairing exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Home team Chesterfield vs. Nottingham Forest\n- Row 2: Leicester City vs. Chelsea\n- Row 3: Derby County vs. Coventry City (replay)\n- Row 4: Manchester City vs. Middlesbrough\n- Row 5: Bradford City vs. Sheffield Wednesday\n- Row 6: Wimbledon vs. Queens Park Rangers\n- Row 7: Leeds United vs. Portsmouth\n- Row 8: Birmingham City vs. Wrexham\n\nI can see that row 7 has the home team as Leeds United and the away team as Portsmouth. So, this directly matches the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The table has a few entries where the same teams might play in different roles, but here we're specifically looking for when Leeds United is home and Portsmouth is away. Only row 7 fits that exactly.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the ones in row 7 under \"home team\" and \"away team.\" Therefore, those two columns are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because there's a match where Leeds United is the home team against Portsmouth as the away team in row 7 of the table.

The table has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row represents a different match.\n\nThe claim is about tie number 1, so I should focus on the first row of the table. Let me check what's in that row.\n\nLooking at tie no column for row 0 (since indexing starts from 0), it says \"1\". So tie number 1 is indeed the first row.\n\nNow, checking the home team for this row: the cell under \"home team\" is \"chesterfield.\" That matches the claim's first part.\n\nNext, the away team for tie number 1 should be nottingham forest. Checking the \"away team\" column in the first row, it says \"nottingham forest.\" So that also matches.\n\nSince both the home and away teams in tie number 1 match the claim, the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if chesterfield is the home team and nottingham forest is the away team for tie number 1. \n\n- **Tie No**: The first row (index 0) has \"1\" in the tie no column.\n- **Home Team**: The \"home team\" cell in this row is \"chesterfield.\"\n- **Away Team**: The \"away team\" cell in this row is \"nottingham forest.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and map it to possible cells in the table. The claim has three main parts: \"leicester city play chelsea\", \"at home\", and \"on 16 february 1997\".\n\nStarting with \"leicester city play chelsea\". In the table, the 'home team' and 'away team' columns are relevant here. I need to find if there's a match where Leicester City is playing against Chelsea.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Home team is Chesterfield, away is Nottingham Forest. Not our teams.\n- Row 2: Home team is Leicester City, away is Chelsea. This matches part of the claim.\n- Row 3: Replay game involving Chelsea vs Leicester City again.\n- Rows 4-8 don't have either team mentioned in the claim.\n\nNext, the claim specifies \"at home\". So I need to check if the match is at Leicester City's home ground. Looking at row 2, the home team is Leicester City and the away team is Chelsea. That means the game was played at Leicester City's home stadium. So this part checks out.\n\nLastly, the date given in the claim is 16 February 1997. I'll check each row for that date:\n\n- Row 1: 15 Feb\n- Row 2: 16 Feb\n- Rows 3-8 have dates on other days or are replays.\n\nSo the match between Leicester City and Chelsea at home on 16 Feb 1997 definitely happened as per the table.

The claim is: \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Portsmouth is not the away team in a match where Leeds United is the home team. So I need to look for matches where Leeds United is the home team and check if Portsmouth is listed as the away team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Chesterfield, away is Nottingham Forest. So not relevant because Leeds isn't the home team here.\n\nRow 2: Home team is Leicester City, away Chelsea. Not relevant for our claim.\n\nRow 3: Home is Chelsea, away Leicester City. Again, not about Leeds United.\n\nWait, actually, no\u2014Leeds is a different team, so this doesn't apply.\n\nRow 4: Home Manchester City vs Middlesbrough. No.\n\nRow 5: Home Bradford City vs Sheffield Wednesday. No.\n\nRow 6: Wimbledon vs Queens Park Rangers. No.\n\nRow 7: Home Leeds United vs Portsmouth. Oh, here we go. The home team is Leeds United, and the away team is Portsmouth.\n\nSo in this match, Leeds United is at home, and Portsmouth is the away team. The claim says that \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\" Wait, no\u2014that's the opposite. The claim seems to suggest that when Leeds is home, Portsmouth shouldn't be the away team. But in row 7, Portsmouth is indeed the away team when Leeds is home.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\" So if Leeds is home, then Portsmouth shouldn't be away. But according to the table, in row 7, when Leeds is home, Portsmouth is the away team.\n\nThat means that the claim is saying that this situation does NOT happen. So if the table shows that it does happen, then the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow 7: Home team Leeds United, away Portsmouth. So yes, in this case, when Leeds is home, Portsmouth is the away team. Therefore, the claim that \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united\" would be false because Portsmouth is indeed the away team when Leeds is at home.\n\nBut wait, could there be another match where Leeds United is the home and Portsmouth is the away? Let me check all rows again quickly.\n\nRows 1-8: Only row 7 has Leeds as home. So only one relevant match here.\n\nTherefore, since in that match Portsmouth is the away team when Leeds is home, the claim is incorrect because it states that Portsmouth shouldn't be the away team in such a scenario. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the table shows that Portsmouth was indeed the away team when Leeds United was the home team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

There's also a \"home team\" and an \"away team\" column. \n\nI'll start by locating tie number 8 in the \"tie no\" column. Scanning through the rows, I see that tie 8 is indeed present. The home team for tie 8 is Birmingham City, and the away team is Wrexham. \n\nNow, checking if the away team is Chelsea. In tie 8's row, the away team is listed as Wrexham, not Chelsea. So this doesn't match the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check to ensure I didn't misread any other rows. Let me go through each tie number again.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"nottingham forest be the away team without a tie number 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It's saying that Nottingham Forest was an away team in a match where the tie number is 1. So I need to find a row with tie no 1 where the home team isn't Nottingham Forest and the away team is Nottingham Forest.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n| tie no | home team       | score   | away team           | attendance       |\n|:---------|:----------------|:--------|:--------------------|:-----------------|\n| 1        | chesterfield    | 1 - 0   | nottingham forest   | 15 february 1997 |\n| 2        | leicester city  | 2 - 2   | chelsea             | 16 february 1997 |\n| replay   | chelsea         | 1 - 0   | leicester city      | 26 february 1997 |\n| 3        | derby county    | 3 - 2   | coventry city       | 26 february 1997 |\n| 4        | manchester city | 0 - 1   | middlesbrough       | 15 february 1997 |\n| 5        | bradford city   | 0 - 1   | sheffield wednesday | 16 february 1997 |\n| 6        | wimbledon       | 2 - 1   | queens park rangers | 15 february 1997 |\n| 7        | leeds united    | 2 - 3   | portsmouth          | 15 february 1997 |\n| 8        | birmingham city | 1 - 3   | wrexham             | 15 february 1997 |\n\nStarting with tie no 1: the home team is Chesterfield, and the away team is Nottingham Forest. So in this case, the away team is indeed Nottingham Forest. Now, does this match have a tie number of 1? Yes, tie no 1.\n\nSo the claim says that Nottingham Forest was an away team without a tie number 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because tie no 1 is exactly the tie where Nottingham Forest was the away team. So if someone claims they're the away team \"without\" a tie number of 1, that would be incorrect since there's a tie number 1 where they were the away team.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's saying that in all ties without number 1, Nottingham Forest wasn't the away team. Let me check if any other tie has a number different from 1 and see if Nottingham Forest is the away team there.\n\nLooking through the rest of the table:\n\ntie no 2: home Leicester City, away Chelsea\ntie no 3: home Derby County, away Coventry City\ntie no 4: home Manchester City, away Middlesbrough\ntie no 5: home Bradford City, away Sheffield Wednesday\ntie no 6: home Wimbledon, away Queens Park Rangers\ntie no 7: home Leeds United, away Portsmouth\ntie no 8: home Birmingham City, away Wrexham\n\nNone of these have Nottingham Forest as the away team except for tie no 1. So in all ties that aren't number 1, Nottingham Forest isn't the away team. Therefore, if the claim is stating that they are an away team without a tie number 1, it's incorrect because there is exactly one tie (no 1) where they were the away team.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"without a tie number 1,\" which might mean in ties that don't have the number 1. So if someone claims Nottingham Forest is an away team in any tie that isn't numbered 1, is that true?\n\nLooking at the other ties (2-8), there's no instance where Nottingham Forest is the away team except tie 1. Therefore, in all ties without a tie number of 1, Nottingham Forest is not the away team. So if someone claims that they are an away team without tie number 1, it would mean that in those other ties, they aren't present. But does that make the claim true?\n\nThe phrasing is tricky. Let me parse the claim again: \"nottingham forest be the away team without a tie number 1.\" So perhaps it's saying that Nottingham Forest is an away team and in their matches, there are no tie numbers of 1. But actually, they were the away team in tie 1, so the presence of tie 1 contradicts that statement.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is stating that in all ties where Nottingham Forest is the away team, none have a tie number of 1, which isn't true because tie 1 exists where they are the away team.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect. However, I need to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly.\n\nAnother approach: does \"without a tie number 1\" mean that in their matches as an away team, there's no match with tie no 1? But in this case, they have one match where tie no 1 occurred, so the claim would be false because they do have a tie number 1.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is trying to say that they are an away team and the tie numbers don't include 1 for their matches, which isn't the case here. So yes, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify which cells support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be where the home team is Chesterfield in tie no 1, because that's the match where Nottingham Forest was the away team with tie no 1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there exists a tie (tie no 1) where Nottingham Forest is the away team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Wait, the table has a row labeled \"replay\" which is row index 2 (since markdown tables start counting from 0?), but that's probably not relevant here because the claim refers to tie numbers like 1,2,3 etc., so replay might be an additional match but not tied as a separate tie number.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure:\n\n| tie no | home team       | score   | away team           | attendance       |\n|:---------|:----------------|:--------|:--------------------|:-----------------|\n| 1        | chesterfield    | 1 - 0   | nottingham forest   | 15 february 1997 |\n| 2        | leicester city  | 2 - 2   | chelsea             | 16 february 1997 |\n| replay   | chelsea         | 1 - 0   | leicester city      | 26 february 1997 |\n| 3        | derby county    | 3 - 2   | coventry city       | 26 february 1997 |\n| 4        | manchester city | 0 - 1   | middlesbrough       | 15 february 1997 |\n| 5        | bradford city   | 0 - 1   | sheffield wednesday | 16 february 1997 |\n| 6        | wimbledon       | 2 - 1   | queens park rangers | 15 february 1997 |\n| 7        | leeds united    | 2 - 3   | portsmouth          | 15 february 1997 |\n| 8        | birmingham city | 1 - 3   | wrexham             | 15 february 1997 |\n\nWait, in row 8, the home team is Birmingham City and away is Wrexham. So the claim is that the tie number with home team Wrexham is 8, but here Wrexham is the away team.\n\nSo there's no row where Wrexham is the home team. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I might have misread. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 1: Home Chesterfield\nRow 2: Leicester City\nRow 3: Derby County\nRow 4: Manchester City\nRow 5: Bradford City\nRow 6: Wimbledon\nRow 7: Leeds United\nRow 8: Birmingham City\n\nNone of these home teams are Wrexham. Therefore, there is no tie with home team Wrexham, so the claim is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not show a match where Wrexham is the home team, specifically for tie number 8 or any other number. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"chelsea be the away team with the home team of coventry city.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The first part is about Chelsea being the away team. That means in some match, Chelsea is playing as the away side. The second part mentions the home team being Coventry City, so in that same match, Coventry City would be on their home ground.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row to see if there's a match where Chelsea is listed as the away team and Coventry City is the home team. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Home team is Chesterfield, score 1-0 against Nottingham Forest. Neither team is Chelsea or Coventry City.\n2. **Row 2**: Leicester City vs. Chelsea. Here, Chelsea is listed as the home team, but we're looking for Chelsea being away. So this doesn't fit.\n3. **Row 3**: Derby County vs. Coventry City. Coventry City is the away team here, so that's not what we need. We need Coventry City as the home team.\n4. **Row 4**: Manchester City vs. Middlesbrough. Neither team is Chelsea or Coventry City.\n5. **Row 5**: Bradford City vs. Sheffield Wednesday. No match for Chelsea or Coventry City.\n6. **Row 6**: Wimbledon vs. Queens Park Rangers. Again, no Chelsea or Coventry City.\n7. **Row 7**: Leeds United vs. Portsmouth. Still not matching.\n8. **Row 8**: Birmingham City vs. Wrexham. Neither team is in question.\n\nWait a second, I might have missed something. Let me double-check the table. The claim says \"chelsea be the away team with the home team of coventry city.\" So I need to find a row where Chelsea is the away team and Coventry City is the home team.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- In **Row 3**, Derby County is home, Coventry City is away.\n- In **Row 4**, Manchester City is home, Middlesbrough is away. No.\n- Wait, did I miss a row where Chelsea is away against Coventry City? Let me check each row's \"away team\" and \"home team.\"\n\nWait, maybe I confused the columns. The table has 'tie no', 'home team', 'score', 'away team', and 'attendance'. So for each tie, home team is first, away is second.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Tie 3: Home team Derby County, away Coventry City.\n- Is there any tie where Chelsea is the away team against Coventry City as home?\n\nI don't see that in the table. The only time Coventry City is the away team is in Tie 3, but then their home would be someone else.\n\nWait, no rows have Chelsea as the away and Coventry City as home. So maybe the claim is false because there's no such match in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Chelsea is the away team when Coventry City is the home team. Checking each row, none of them show Chelsea as the away against Coventry City.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
