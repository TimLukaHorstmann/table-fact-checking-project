The claim says, \"punt road oval have a crowd of 30000 , the biggest 1 with western oval next at 20000.\" \n\nFirst, I should look into the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. My focus is on the \"crowd\" column because the claim talks about crowd numbers.\n\nI need to find out if punt road oval's crowd is 30,000 according to the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. south melbourne vs hawthorn at lake oval had a crowd of 13,000.\n2. richmond vs geelong at punt road oval had a crowd of 30,000.\n3. fitzroy vs essendon at brunswick street oval had a crowd of 14,000.\n4. footscray vs st kilda at western oval had a crowd of 20,000.\n5. carlton vs melbourne at princes park had a crowd of 32,000.\n6. north melbourne vs collingwood at arden street oval had a crowd of 18,000.\n\nSo, punt road oval's game indeed had the highest crowd of 30,000. The next highest is western oval with 20,000. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the biggest 1\" and \"next at 20000.\" It doesn't specify whether that's the only maximum or if there are others. In the table, punt road oval has the highest crowd at 30,000, which makes it the biggest. Then, western oval is next with 20,000.\n\nHowever, the claim mentions \"punt road oval have a crowd of 30000 , the biggest 1 with western oval next at 20000.\" There's no mention of other venues, so as per the table, the claim holds true because punt road oval has 30,000 and western oval follows with 20,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"Hawthorn's away team score of 9.6 (60) be lower by 1.5 than that of Geelong.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'm searching for two specific pieces of information:\n\n1. Hawthorn's away team score.\n2. Geelong's away team score.\n\nI'll start by identifying their respective rows and columns.\n\nIn the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"home team score,\" and \"away team score.\" \n\nFocusing on Hawthorn, it's listed as the away team in the first row (row index 0). Their score is 9.6 (60), which matches the claim.\n\nFor Geelong, they're also an away team but in a different row. Looking through the table, I find Geelong in row index 1, where their score is 10.11 (71).\n\nNow, I need to compare these scores: Hawthorn's 9.6 (60) and Geelong's 10.11 (71). To check if Hawthorn's score is lower by exactly 1.5 points:\n\nCalculate the difference: 71 - 60 = 11.\n\nThe claim states a difference of 1.5, but here it's 11, which is much larger. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n\nSince the claim isn't supported by the table, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about South Melbourne as a home team having a score of 10.13 (73), being the lowest among all home team scores in the table is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it says \"south melbourne as home team have a score of 10.13 (73) , the lowest home team score.\" So, my task is to check if South Melbourne's score is indeed the lowest among all home teams listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are five home teams: south melbourne, richmond, fitzroy, footscray, and carlton. Their respective scores as home teams are:\n\n- south melbourne: 10.13 (73)\n- richmond: 13.10 (88)\n- fitzroy: 19.11 (125)\n- footscray: 12.11 (83)\n- carlton: 13.13 (91)\n\nNow, I need to compare these scores to see if 10.13 (73) is the lowest.\n\nLet me list them numerically:\n\n1. south melbourne: 73 points\n2. footscray: 83 points\n3. richmond: 88 points\n4. carlton: 91 points\n5. fitzroy: 125 points\n\nSo, 73 is indeed the lowest among all home team scores. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for this verification.\n\nThe table has the following columns for each row:\n\n- home team\n- home team score\n- away team\n- away team score\n- venue\n- crowd\n- date\n\nSince we're comparing home team scores, the relevant columns are \"home team\" and \"home team score\". So, I should extract these two pieces of information for each relevant row.\n\nTherefore, for South Melbourne's case:\n\n- The row index is 0 (assuming rows start from 0).\n- Columns involved: \"home team score\".\n\nI need to list all the cells that are part of this verification. That would be the cell in the \"home team\" column and the \"home team score\" column for South Melbourne.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include:\n\n1. row_index=0, column_name=\"home team\"\n2. row_index=0, column_name=\"home team score\"\n\nWait, but according to the example given, each relevant_cell is an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So for South Melbourne's case, there are two columns to check: home team (to confirm it's indeed South Melbourne) and home team score.\n\nBut wait, in the table provided, South Melbourne is the first row. So, yes, checking their score and that it's correct as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For row 0: \"home team\" and \"home team score\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify that South Melbourne's home team score of 10.13 (73) is indeed the lowest among all home teams listed in the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - We are interested in the \"home team\" and their respective scores.\n   - The claim specifies South Melbourne as a home team, so we'll focus on their row.\n\n2. **Extract Home Team Scores:**\n   - south melbourne: 10.13 (73)\n   - richmond: 13.10 (88)\n   - fitzroy: 19.11 (125)\n   - footscray: 12.11 (83)\n   - carlton: 13.13 (91)\n\n3. **Compare Scores:**\n   - South Melbourne's score is 73, which is lower than all other home team scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince South Melbourne's score of 10.13 (73) is the lowest among all listed home teams, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells Identified:**\n\n- The cells in row 0 for \"home team\" and \"home team score\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the crowd numbers in the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the crowd in arden street oval be 4000 more than the crowd who watch at the brunswick street oval.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim is comparing two venues: arden street oval and brunswick street oval. So I need to find the crowd numbers for these two venues in the table.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n1. The first row has south melbourne as the home team at lake oval with a crowd of 13000.\n2. The second row is richmond at punt road oval with 30000 spectators.\n3. The third row is fitzroy at brunswick street oval, which had 14000 people.\n4. The fourth row is footscray at western oval with 20000.\n5. The fifth row is carlton at princes park with 32000.\n6. The sixth row is north melbourne at arden street oval with a crowd of 18000.\n\nSo, the relevant rows for the claim are fitzroy's game at brunswick street oval (crowd 14000) and north melbourne's game at arden street oval (crowd 18000).\n\nThe claim states that arden street oval had 4000 more people than brunswick street oval. So I need to check if 18000 is equal to 14000 plus 4000. Let me do the math: 14000 + 4000 = 18000. That's exactly what arden street oval has.\n\nWait, but in the table, fitzroy is at brunswick street oval with 14000, and north melbourne is at arden street oval with 18000. So yes, arden had 14000 more than brunswick? Wait no, the claim says \"4000 more.\" Oh wait, 18000 - 14000 = 4000 exactly. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because 18,000 is indeed 4,000 more than 14,000.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The home team for arden street oval is north melbourne, and the crowd is 18000. That's row index 5 (since it's the sixth entry but starts at 0). For brunswick street oval, the home team is fitzroy with a crowd of 14000, which is row index 2.\n\nSo relevant_cells would be:\n\n- Row 5, column \"crowd\" for arden street oval.\n- Row 2, column \"crowd\" for brunswick street oval.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date. So the 'crowd' is a separate column. Therefore, each row has a specific crowd number under that column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5 (north melbourne) in the \"crowd\" column.\n- Row 2 (fitzroy) in the \"crowd\" column.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be TRUE with those two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be true because the crowd at arden street oval is exactly 4000 more than that at brunswick street oval, and the relevant cells are identified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows in the table with data from different football games.\n\nThe claim says, \"3 game be hold on 3 june 1933 and none of it be in arden street oval.\" Hmm, I need to check if this statement is true based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that three games were held on June 3, 1933, but all of them were not at Arden Street Oval. Wait, actually, the way it's phrased might be a bit unclear. Let me break it down:\n\n- \"3 game be hold\": So, three games took place.\n- \"on 3 june 1933\": So, these three games occurred on June 3, 1933.\n- \"and none of it be in arden street oval\": None of the games were held at Arden Street Oval.\n\nSo the claim is asserting that there were three games on that date, and all of them weren't played at Arden Street Oval. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that all three games weren't held at Arden Street Oval. Wait, perhaps I should look at each game's venue to verify this.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: south melbourne vs hawthorn, venue is lake oval.\nRow 1: richmond vs geelong, venue is punt road oval.\nRow 2: fitzroy vs essendon, venue is brunswick street oval.\nRow 3: footscray vs st kilda, venue is western oval.\nRow 4: carlton vs melbourne, venue is princes park.\nRow 5: north melbourne vs collingwood, venue is arden street oval.\n\nSo the fifth row (north melbourne vs collingwood) is at Arden Street Oval. The claim says none of them were in Arden Street Oval, but this game was indeed there. Therefore, the claim would be false because one of the games was held at Arden Street Oval on that date.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. It says \"none of it be in arden street oval,\" which could mean none were played there. But since one game was, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to find all relevant cells that check whether any games on June 3, 1933, were at Arden Street Oval. The date column is \"date\" for each row. So I should look for rows where the date is \"3 june 1933\" and venue is \"arden street oval.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nOnly row 5 (north melbourne vs collingwood) has a date of \"5 june 1933,\" but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the table provided by the user, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's table shows for row 0: date is 3 june 1933.\nRow 1: same date.\nRow 2: same date.\nRow 3: 5 june 1933.\nRow 4: 5 june 1933.\nRow 5: 5 june 1933.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me re-examine the table:\n\nIn the user's markdown table, row indices start from 0 to 5. The date for rows 0 and 1 is \"3 june 1933,\" while rows 3,4,5 have \"5 june 1933.\" Wait, no, looking again:\n\n- Row 0: 3 june 1933\n- Row 1: 3 june 1933\n- Row 2: 3 june 1933 (no, wait, the user's table shows row 2 as fitzroy vs essendon with date 3 june 1933. Then row 3 is footscray vs st kilda on 5 june. So only rows 0-2 have 3 june, and rows 3-5 have 5 june.\n\nSo the claim says \"3 game be hold on 3 june 1933.\" But according to the table, only three games were held on 3 june: south melbourne vs hawthorn (row0), richmond vs geelong (row1), and fitzroy vs essendon (row2). Then rows 3-5 are on 5 june.\n\nSo the claim is about three games on June 3, but in reality, there are only three such games. So that part of the claim holds. But then it says \"none of it be in arden street oval.\" However, in row5 (north melbourne vs collingwood on 5 june), the venue is Arden Street Oval, which is a different date. Wait, but the claim is about games on June 3, not June 5.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the dates. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row0: south melbourne vs hawthorn, date 3 june 1933\n- Row1: richmond vs geelong, date 3 june 1933\n- Row2: fitzroy vs essendon, date 3 june 1933\n- Row3: footscray vs st kilda, date 5 june 1933\n- Row4: carlton vs melbourne, date 5 june 1933\n- Row5: north melbourne vs collingwood, date 5 june 1933\n\nSo the claim is about games on June 3. Only rows0-2 are on that date. None of these three games were at Arden Street Oval because their venues are lake oval, punt road oval, and brunswick street oval.\n\nWait, but then the claim says \"none of it be in arden street oval,\" but all three games on June 3 weren't there. So the claim would be true? Because all three games on that date were not at Arden Street Oval.\n\nBut wait, the user's table shows that on June 5, there was a game at Arden Street Oval (north melbourne vs collingwood), but that's on a different date. The claim is about games on 3 June, so that game isn't included in the three games it's referring to.\n\nSo the claim says that on 3 June 1933, three games were held and none of them were at Arden Street Oval. Since all three games on that day were elsewhere, the claim is true.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the fifth row is on June 5, which is a different date. So for the three games on June 3, none were at Arden Street Oval, making the claim true.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the dates? Because rows0-2 have 3 june, and rows3-5 have 5 june. So if the claim is about June 3, then no game on that date was at Arden Street Oval, so it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the venues:\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow0: venue lake oval\nRow1: punt road oval\nRow2: brunswick street oval\nRow3: footscray park\nRow4: princes park\nRow5: arden street oval\n\nSo only row5 is at Arden Street Oval, which is on June 5. The three games on June 3 are not there.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement holds true. So the answer would be that the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on June 3, 1933, three games were held and none of them took place at Arden Street Oval. Based on the provided table:\n\n- **Three games** (rows0-2) occurred on June 3, with venues at lake oval, punt road oval, and brunswick street oval.\n- None of these three games were held at Arden Street Oval.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **true**.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true.",

The claim in question is: \"Hawthorn 's away team score of 9.6 (60) be higher by 1.5 than that of Geelong.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table provided. It's an markdown table with several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"Hawthorn\" as the home team and their away team score. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because in football (assuming this is Australian Rules Football), when a team is listed as the \"away team,\" it means they're visiting another club. So, if Hawthorn is the home team, then Geelong would be the away team in that match. But the claim says Hawthorn's away team score\u2014does that mean Hawthorn was the away team in some other game? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLooking back at the table, I see two relevant rows: one where Hawthorn is the home team against South Melbourne with a score of 9.6 (60), and another where Geelong is the away team against Richmond with a score of 10.11 (71). Wait, no\u2014the claim is about Hawthorn's away score being higher than Geelong's. So perhaps I need to check if Hawthorn has ever been an away team in any match.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. South Melbourne vs. Hawthorn: Hawthorn is home with a score of 9.6 (60).\n2. Richmond vs. Geelong: Geelong is away with a score of 10.11 (71).\n3. Fitzroy vs. Essendon: Fitzroy is home, so Essendon is away.\n4. Footscray vs. St Kilda: Footscray is home, St Kilda away.\n5. Carlton vs. Melbourne: Carlton is home, Melbourne away.\n6. North Melbourne vs. Collingwood: North Melbourne is home, Collingwood away.\n\nFrom this table, I don't see Hawthorn being the away team in any match. Therefore, there's no row where Hawthorn is listed as an away team with a score of 9.6 (60). This suggests that the claim might be incorrect because the premise doesn't hold\u2014it seems that Hawthorn isn't the away team with that score on the given dates.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The claim says \"Hawthorn's away team score of 9.6 (60).\" So perhaps in some match where Hawthorn was away, their score was 9.6 (60). But looking at the table, all matches with Hawthorn as home have that score. There's no match where they are away with that score.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data supporting Hawthorn being an away team with a 9.6 (60) score on the dates provided, the claim is based on incorrect information.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"south melbourne as home team have a score of 13.13 (91), the lowest home team score.\" So, the claim is making two points:\n\n1. South Melbourne, when playing at home, scored 13.13 (91).\n2. This score is the lowest among all home team scores in the table.\n\nI'll need to check each part against the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date. So, the relevant columns for this claim are \"home team\" and \"home team score.\"\n\nFirst, I should verify that South Melbourne is indeed a home team in the table. Scanning through the home teams listed: south melbourne, richmond, fitzroy, footscray, carlton, north melbourne. Yes, south melbourne is there as a home team.\n\nNext, what was their score? The \"south melbourne\" row shows their score as 10.13 (73). Wait, that's different from the claim which states 13.13 (91). That's a discrepancy. So already, this seems off. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nHold on, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again. The first row: south melbourne has a home team score of 10.13 (73). Then, looking at other rows: richmond scored 13.10 (88), fitzroy 19.11 (125), footscray 12.11 (83), carlton 13.13 (91), and north melbourne 17.11 (113).\n\nSo, the home team scores are: 10.13 (73), 13.10 (88), 19.11 (125), 12.11 (83), 13.13 (91), 17.11 (113). The lowest among these would be 10.13 (73) by south melbourne, not 13.13 (91).\n\nThe claim states that south melbourne scored 13.13 (91), which is actually the score of carlton, as per the table. So that's incorrect.\n\nFurthermore, even if we consider the claim's first part, South Melbourne doesn't have a score of 13.13 (91) in their home games\u2014they have 10.13 (73). Their away game isn't relevant here since the claim specifies them as a home team.\n\nAlso, looking at all home team scores, south melbourne has the lowest with 73 points, so any other home team cannot have a lower score than that. The claim incorrectly attributes a higher score to South Melbourne and claims it's the lowest, which is false because their actual score is lower than others.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because south melbourne's home score in the table is 10.13 (73), not 13.13 (91). Additionally, this is actually the lowest among all home team scores, making the claim incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "4 game be hold on 3 june 1933 and none of it be in arden punt road oval",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by reading the claim carefully: \"4 game be hold on 3 june 1933 and none of it be in arden punt road oval.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into two parts:\n\n1. \"4 game be held on 3 June 1933.\"\n2. \"None of it be in arden punt road oval.\"\n\nSo, the first part is about there being four games on that specific date, and the second part is saying none were played at Arden Punt Road Oval.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple entries for games on different dates. The date column has two entries: June 3, 1933, and June 5, 1933. Wait, so not all games are on the same day? No, looking closer, actually, it's three games on June 3 and three games on June 5.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\n- On June 3:\n  - South Melbourne vs Hawthorn\n  - Richmond vs Geelong\n  - Fitzroy vs Essendon\n\nThat's three games. So maybe the claim is saying four games were held on June 3, which would be incorrect because there are only three.\n\nBut the claim says \"4 game be hold on 3 june 1933.\" Wait, maybe it's a typo? Maybe they meant three games, not four. Or perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 0: June 3\nRow 1: June 3\nRow 2: June 3\nRows 3 and 4: June 5\n\nSo only three games on June 3.\n\nThen, the second part of the claim says \"none of it be in arden punt road oval.\" Arden Punt Road Oval is one of the venues listed. Let's check which games were played where.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: venue is lake oval\n- Row 1: punt road oval\n- Row 2: brunswick street oval\n- Row 3: western oval\n- Row 4: princes park\n- Row 5: arden street oval\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"arden punt road oval,\" which isn't exactly matching any venue in the table. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe venues are:\n\n1. lake oval\n2. punt road oval\n3. brunswick street oval\n4. western oval\n5. princes park\n6. arden street oval\n\nSo the claim says \"none of it be in arden punt road oval.\" But looking at the table, on June 3, there are three games:\n\n- South Melbourne vs Hawthorn at lake oval\n- Richmond vs Geelong at punt road oval\n- Fitzroy vs Essendon at brunswick street oval\n\nNone of these are at arden punt road oval. So the second part is correct.\n\nBut the first part says four games on June 3, but there are only three. So that's incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim is false because it claims four games were held on June 3 when in fact there were three. Also, the venue part might be a bit confusing, but since none of the games were at arden punt road oval as per the table, that part holds.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the venues. Let me check again:\n\nRow 0: lake oval\nRow 1: punt road oval\nRow 2: brunswick street oval\nRow 3: western oval\nRow 4: princes park\nRow 5: arden street oval\n\nYes, so on June 3, none of the games were at arden punt road oval. So the second part is correct.\n\nBut since the first part is incorrect (only three games, not four), the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim says that four games were held on June 3, 1933, but only three games actually took place that day. Additionally, none of these games were at Arden Punt Road Oval, which aligns with the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the crowd in arden street oval be 4000 less than the crowd who watch at the brunswick street oval.\" So, I'm looking for a comparison between two crowds at two venues: arden street oval and brunswick street oval.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find these venues. Scanning through the 'venue' column:\n\n- Lake Oval\n- Punt Road Oval\n- Brunswick Street Oval\n- Western Oval\n- Princes Park\n- Arden Street Oval\n\nSo, arden street oval is one venue, and brunswick street oval is another.\n\nNow, I need to find the crowd numbers for both. I'll go through each row until I find \"arden street oval\" and \"brunswick street oval\".\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: south melbourne vs hawthorn at Lake Oval - crowd 13000\n2. Row 1: richmond vs geelong at Punt Road Oval - crowd 30000\n3. Row 2: fitzroy vs essendon at Brunswick Street Oval - crowd 14000\n4. Row 3: footscray vs st kilda at Western Oval - crowd 20000\n5. Row 4: carlton vs melbourne at Princes Park - crowd 32000\n6. Row 5: north melbourne vs collingwood at Arden Street Oval - crowd 18000\n\nOkay, so arden street oval is in row 5 with a crowd of 18,000.\n\nBrunswick street oval is in row 2 with a crowd of 14,000.\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at arden street oval is 4000 less than those who watched at brunswick street oval. So I need to see if 18,000 (arden) = 14,000 (brunswick) - 4,000.\n\nCalculating: 14,000 minus 4,000 equals 10,000. But arden has 18,000, which is more than 10,000. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I got it backwards? The claim says the crowd in arden is 4000 less than those who watched at brunswick. So it's expecting arden's crowd to be less than brunswick's by 4k. But according to the table, arden had 18k and brunswick had 14k. That would mean brunswick's crowd was less than arden's by 4k, which is not what the claim says.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check: row 2 is fitzroy vs essendon at Brunswick Street Oval with a crowd of 14000. Row 5 is north melbourne vs collingwood at Arden Street Oval with 18000. So arden's crowd (18k) is higher than brunswick's (14k). Therefore, the claim that arden's crowd is 4000 less than brunswick's is incorrect because it's actually more.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is worded differently. Let me parse it again: \"the crowd in arden street oval be 4000 less than the crowd who watch at the brunswick street oval.\" So, if someone watched at brunswick, their number was X, and arden had X - 4k.\n\nBut according to the table, arden has more people. So the claim is saying that arden's crowd is lower by 4k, which isn't true because it's higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the venues. Let me make sure I got them right. Yes, row 2 is brunswick street oval and row 5 is arden street oval.\n\nSo, the calculation: 14,000 (brunswick) - 4,000 equals 10,000. Arden's crowd is 18k, which isn't 10k. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm supposed to compare the two venues regardless of the teams or dates. So yes, arden had 18000 and brunswick had 14000, so arden is not 4000 less. It's actually higher by 4k.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the crowd at Arden Street Oval was 4000 less than those at Brunswick Street Oval is false because the crowd at Arden Street Oval (18,000) is actually larger than the crowd at Brunswick Street Oval (14,000).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
