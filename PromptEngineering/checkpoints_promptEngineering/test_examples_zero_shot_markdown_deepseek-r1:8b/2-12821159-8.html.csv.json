    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"runner - up, rick huiskamp's margin of victory be 10 stroke.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table. Let me break down the claim into two main parts. \n\n1. **Runner-up is Rick Huiskamp**: The claim mentions that Rick Huiskamp was the runner-up. So, I need to find the row where Rick Huiskamp is listed as the runner-up.\n\n2. **Margin of Victory is 10 strokes**: The margin of victory for that specific tournament should be 10 strokes.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nI'll go through each row to check if Rick Huiskamp was the runner-up and then verify his margin of victory in that tournament.\n\n- Row 0: date is June 14, 2005. Tournament is Central German Classic. Runner-up is Wolfgang Huget. Not Rick.\n- Row 1: June 1, 2006. Friedberg Classic. Runner-up is Mark Grabow Schytter. No.\n- Row 2: June 22, 2006. Habsburg Classic. Runner-up is Rick Huiskamp. Yes, this matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, check the margin of victory for this tournament. The column for \"margin of victory\" in row 2 shows 10 strokes. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, both conditions are satisfied: Rick Huiskamp was the runner-up with a 10-stroke margin of victory in the Habsburg Classic on June 22, 2006.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"rick huiskamp be a runner - up , finish up with a single - digit margin of victory.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has several columns: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runner-up. My task is to check if Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up in any of his tournaments with a single-digit margin of victory.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **14 jun 2005**: The runner-up here is Wolfgang Huget. Not Rick.\n2. **1 jun 2006**: Runner-up is Mark Grabow Schytter. Not Rick.\n3. **22 jun 2006**: Runner-up is Rick Huiskamp. Okay, so he was a runner-up here.\n4. **4 jul 2006**: Runner-up is Lasse Jensen. Not Rick.\n5. **12 jul 2006**: Runner-up is Richard Treis. Not Rick.\n6. **17 aug 2006**: Runner-up is Christoph G\u00fcnther. Not Rick.\n\nSo, the only time Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up is in the row for \"22 jun 2006\". Now, I need to check if that particular tournament had a single-digit margin of victory. The margin of victory column for this row says \"10 strokes.\" \n\nWait, 10 strokes isn't a single-digit number. Single-digit margins would be 1 through 9. So even though he was a runner-up here, the margin wasn't single-digit.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: Rick being a runner-up and having a single-digit margin of victory. The first part is true, but the second part isn't. Since both conditions need to be met for the claim to be true, it's false overall.\n\nI should list which cells are relevant. The runner-up column shows Rick was a runner-up in row 3 (index 2). The margin of victory is 10 strokes, which is in that same row. So the relevant cells are both from row 3: one for the runner-up and one for the margin.\n\nPutting it all together, since both conditions aren't fully met, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
