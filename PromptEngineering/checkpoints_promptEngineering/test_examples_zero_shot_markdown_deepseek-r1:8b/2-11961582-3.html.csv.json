    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the november 16 score be i 123 - 126\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a game that happened on November 16th with a score of \"I 123 - 126\". Wait, the word \"I\" here seems unusual in the context of basketball scores. Typically, scores are either like \"W 101 - 94\" for a win or \"L 91 - 92\" for a loss. The \"I\" doesn't seem to fit into that format. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it refers to something else.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row corresponds to a game with details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The key columns here are \"date\" and \"score\". So for November 16, which is row number 8, let's check the score.\n\nRow 8 has the date as november 16 and the score listed as l 123 - 126. That stands out because it's a loss (l), followed by the scores 123 and 126. The claim mentions \"I 123 - 126\", which is different from what's in the table. Instead, the correct score should be l 123 - 126.\n\nSo the claim is using an incorrect notation (\"I\" instead of \"L\") for the game result. That would make the statement FALSE because it doesn't match the actual score as per the table.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The main cells to check are the \"date\" and \"score\" columns. For November 16, that's row index 8. So the relevant cells are the date (row 8, column \"date\") and the score (row 8, column \"score\").\n\nPutting it all together, since the claim incorrectly states the result as \"I\", which doesn't align with the table data, the answer should be FALSE. And the relevant cells are clearly identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
