The claim is: \"james hunt ran on grid 2 for 73 lap\". \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and find the corresponding cells in the table.\n\nStarting with \"james hunt\", I'll search the driver column to locate his row. Scanning down, I see that the first entry is James Hunt in row index 0. That's correct.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"grid 2\". In the table, each row has a grid column. Looking at row 0, under the grid column, it shows the number 2. So that matches.\n\nThen, the laps part says \"73 lap\". The laps column in row 0 also shows 73. That's correct as well.\n\nI should check if all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Since James Hunt is on grid 2, completed 73 laps, it seems accurate.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE and the relevant cells are driver (james hunt), laps (73), and grid (2).\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because all elements of the claim (James Hunt, grid position 2, 73 laps) align with the corresponding table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that James Hunt has less than 72 laps and a grid position of 1.\n\nFirst, I'll locate James Hunt in the table. Scanning through the driver names, I see James Hunt listed first with row index 0. Now, I need to check his number of laps and grid position from the relevant columns.\n\nLooking at the \"laps\" column for James Hunt, it shows 73 laps. Since 73 is not less than 72, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, checking the \"grid\" column, James Hunt's grid position is listed as 2, not 1. So his grid position also doesn't meet the claim's condition.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are not met by the table data, the overall claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"grid 23 be a +4 lap in the time / retired section.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what each part means. The grid number mentioned is 23. Looking at the table, each row has a driver's name, constructor, laps, time or reason for retirement, and their starting grid position.\n\nI need to find where the grid is 23 in the 'grid' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. James Hunt - grid 2\n2. Carlos Reutemann - grid 7\n3. Patrick Depailler - grid 15\n4. Alan Jones - grid 12\n5. Jacques Laffite - grid 5\n6. Riccardo Patrese - grid 13\n7. Hans Joachim Stuck - grid 4\n8. Vittorio Brambilla - grid 9\n9. Kunimitsu Takahashi - grid 22\n10. Jody Scheckter - grid 6\n11. Kazuyoshi Hoshino - grid 11\n12. Alex Ribeiro - grid 23\n\nWait, here we go. Alex Ribeiro is in row 12 (if rows start at 0, it's actually row index 12) and his grid position is 23. So that's where the grid 23 is.\n\nNow, looking at the 'time / retired' column for this driver. The time given is \"+4 laps\". That means he retired after completing 4 laps more than the race's length, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSo the claim is checking if grid 23 has a +4 lap retirement, and according to the table, it does.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in grid position 23, the driver retired after completing +4 laps. Checking the table, Alex Ribeiro (grid 23) did indeed have a time of \"+4 laps\". \n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"+ 4 lap be not the time / retire for grid 23\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim seems a bit confusingly phrased. Let me break it down. It says that \"+4 lap\" is not the time or reason for retirement for the driver in grid position 23. So, I'm looking for a driver in grid 23 whose \"time / retired\" column does not have \"+4 laps\". \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a driver, with their constructor, number of laps, time/reason, and grid position. I need to check the rows where the grid is 23.\n\nFrom the table, scanning down to find grid 23: I see that in the \"grid\" column, there's a value 23 for Alex Ribeiro. So, row index for Alex Ribeiro is row 10 (since it starts counting from 0? Or wait, no, let me count again.\n\nWait, looking at the table headers, the first data row is james hunt, which is row index 0. Then carlos reutemann is row 1, and so on until alex ribeiro is row 10 because I see gunnar nilsson as row 11, clay regazzoni as row 12, john watson as row 13, jochen mass as row 14, patrick tambay as row 15, ronnie peterson as row 16, gilles villeneuve as row 17, jean-pierre jarier as row 18, mario andretti as row 19, noritake takahara as row 20, hans binder as row 21. So, yes, alex ribeiro is indeed row 10.\n\nNow, looking at Alex Ribeiro's \"time / retired\" column: it says \"+4 laps\". Wait, that matches the claim? No, wait. The claim says that \"+4 lap be not...\" So if grid 23 (which is Alex) has +4 laps as their time, then the claim would be false because the statement is saying that it's not the case.\n\nWait, let me parse the claim again: \"+4 lap be not the time / retired for grid 23\". Hmm. Maybe the user meant to say that a driver in grid 23 did not have +4 laps as their reason for retirement or time. So if grid 23 has +4 laps, then the claim is false because it's saying it shouldn't be.\n\nBut looking at the table, for Alex Ribeiro in grid 23, the \"time / retired\" is \"+4 laps\". That means the claim is incorrect because he does have that reason. Therefore, the claim should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"+4 lap\" is not the reason for retirement or time for the driver in grid 23. Upon checking the table, Alex Ribeiro (grid 23) has \"+4 laps\" as their reason, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
