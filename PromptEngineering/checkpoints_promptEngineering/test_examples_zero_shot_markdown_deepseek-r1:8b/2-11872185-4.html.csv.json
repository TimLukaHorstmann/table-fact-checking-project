    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that none of the movies listed have a lifetime India distributor share before 2009. So, in other words, all the entries for \"lifetime india distributor share\" should be equal to or greater than 2009.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are several movies with their respective years and the corresponding \"lifetime india distributor share.\" My task is to check each of these shares against the claim.\n\nLet me start by identifying which columns and rows are relevant. The key column here is \"lifetime india distributor share\" because that's what the claim refers to. I'll need to look at every row in this column to see if any of them are less than 2009.\n\nNow, let me go through each movie one by one:\n\n1. Chennai Express (2013): Share = 114,250,000. That's way above 2009.\n2. Ek Tha Tiger (2012): Share = 106,000,000. Also above 2009.\n3. 3 Idiots (2009): Share = 99,020,000. Hmm, this is exactly in 2009, but wait, the claim says \"earlier than 2009.\" Since 2009 is not earlier than itself, it's acceptable. But I need to check if the share is given before 2009 or equal to 2009.\n4. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013): Share = 91,000,000. Above 2009.\n5. Dabangg 2 (2012): Share = 84,000,000. Also above 2009.\n6. Bodyguard (2011): Share = 79,490,000. This is below 2009. So this seems to contradict the claim.\n7. Dabangg (2010): Share = 76,840,000. Below 2009 as well.\n8. Rowdy Rathore (2012): Share = 74,000,000. Again, below 2009.\n9. Agneepath (2012): Share = 65,530,000. Also below.\n10. Ready (2011): Share = 64,580,000. Below too.\n\nFrom this analysis, I can see that several movies have a \"lifetime india distributor share\" less than 2009. Specifically, Bodyguard (79,490,000), Dabangg (76,840,000), Rowdy Rathore (74,000,000), Agneepath (65,530,000), and Ready (64,580,000) all have shares below 2009.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009\" is FALSE because there are movies in the table with shares less than 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because several entries have a lifetime India distributors share below 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributor share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributor share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributor share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributors share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributors share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about movies, their years, studios, and lifetime India distributor shares. The claim in question is: \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand exactly what the claim is saying. It's stating that for movies released before 2009, their lifetime India distributor share was zero. So, my job is to check if all movies listed in the table that were released before 2009 have a lifetime India distributors share of zero.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let me list out the movies along with their release years:\n\n1. Chennai Express - 2013\n2. Ek Tha Tiger - 2012\n3. 3 Idiots - 2009\n4. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani - 2013\n5. Dabangg 2 - 2012\n6. Bodyguard - 2011\n7. Dabangg - 2010\n8. Rowdy Rathore - 2012\n9. Agneepath - 2012\n10. Ready - 2011\n\nNow, I need to identify which of these movies were released before 2009 because the claim talks about \"earlier than 2009\". Let's see:\n\n- Chennai Express: 2013 (after 2009)\n- Ek Tha Tiger: 2012 (after 2009)\n- 3 Idiots: 2009 (exact year, not earlier)\n- Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani: 2013\n- Dabangg 2: 2012\n- Bodyguard: 2011\n- Dabangg: 2010\n- Rowdy Rathore: 2012\n- Agneepath: 2012\n- Ready: 2011\n\nSo, the movies released before 2009 are Bodyguard (2011), Dabangg (2010), and Ready (2011). These three need to be checked for their lifetime India distributors share.\n\nLooking at the \"lifetime india distributor share\" column:\n\n- Bodyguard: 79 , 49 , 00000\n- Dabangg: 76 , 84 , 00000\n- Ready: 64 , 58 , 00000\n\nWait a minute, each of these entries has numbers after the comma. For example, Bodyguard's share is listed as 79 , 49 , 00000. Hmm, that seems odd because if we're talking about the lifetime India share, it shouldn't be a range or have multiple numbers. Maybe there's a formatting issue in the table. Perhaps the relevant number is the first one after the comma? Or maybe each entry is meant to represent something else.\n\nBut according to the table, the \"lifetime india distributor share\" for these three movies are all non-zero values. For instance:\n\n- Bodyguard: 79\n- Dabangg: 76\n- Ready: 64\n\nWait, but looking at the table again, maybe the numbers are separated by commas, and perhaps the first number is the actual share, while the others are placeholders or something else. Alternatively, it might be that each entry has multiple numbers due to some formatting error.\n\nBut regardless of how the numbers are presented, the key point is whether these movies (Bodyguard, Dabangg, Ready) have a lifetime India share of zero if they were released earlier than 2009. According to their data:\n\n- Bodyguard: 79\n- Dabangg: 76\n- Ready: 64\n\nAll three have non-zero shares. That means the claim that \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is false because these movies did have shares.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this conclusion.\n\nLooking back at the table, each movie's row has a rank, movie name, year, studio, and lifetime India share. The relevant columns are:\n\n- For each of Bodyguard (rank 6), Dabangg (rank7), and Ready (rank10), we need their \"lifetime india distributor share\" data.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 6: column \"lifetime india distributor share\"\n- Row index 7: same column\n- Row index 10: same column\n\nI should format this as a JSON object with \"answer\": \"FALSE\" and include these relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributor share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributors share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributors share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided.\n\nThe claim is: \"agneepath be release first in 2010.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the movie \"Agneepath\" was released first (i.e., has the highest rank) in the year 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different movie with various details including rank, year, studio, and lifetime India distributor share. The movies are listed from rank 1 to 10, so lower rank numbers mean more recent releases if we assume they're ordered by release date.\n\nI need to verify two things: \n1. Whether \"Agneepath\" was released in 2010.\n2. Whether it was the first movie (highest rank) to be released that year or overall in the table.\n\nStarting with the first part, I'll look for the row where the movie is \"Agneepath.\" Scanning through the table, I see that \"Agneepath\" is listed at rank 9 with a release year of 2012. That means the claim's statement about it being released in 2010 is false because it actually came out in 2012.\n\nSince the movie wasn't even released in 2010 but in 2012, the entire claim doesn't hold. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to identify which cells are most relevant. The claim mentions both the release year and the rank (first in 2010). So, looking at the table, the \"year\" column is definitely important because it shows the actual release year of \"Agneepath.\" Also, the \"rank\" column is crucial because the claim refers to being first (highest rank).\n\nSo the relevant cells are the ones for \"Agneepath,\" specifically row 9 for the movie and its details in columns \"year\" and \"rank.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about a movie called \"ek tha tiger\" being released in 2009 and being the first release that year. So, my task is to check if in the table, \"ektha tiger\" was indeed released in 2009 and whether it was the first movie listed for that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has several columns: rank, movie name, year, studio, and lifetime India distributor share. The claim is specifically about the year 2009 and the movie \"ek tha tiger.\"\n\nI'll start by looking for the movie \"ek tha tiger\" in the table. Scanning down, I find it at row number 2, but let me check again to make sure. Wait, no\u2014row 2 is ek ta tiger? No, actually, row 2 is \"ek tha tiger.\" Let me confirm: row 1 is chennai express (2013), row 2 is ektha tiger (2012), so maybe I misread it earlier.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, the table's rank starts at 1 and goes up by 1 each time. The movies are listed in order of their release or something else? Let me check the years to see when \"ek tha tiger\" was released. Looking at row 2, the year is 2012. So the claim says it was released in 2009, but according to the table, it's actually 2012.\n\nWait, that would mean the claim is FALSE because ektha tiger wasn't released in 2009. But let me double-check. Maybe I misread the row numbers. Let me list them out:\n\nRow 1: chennai express - 2013\nRow 2: ek tha tiger - 2012\nRow 3: 3 idiots - 2009\nRow 4: yeh jawaani hai deewani - 2013\nRow 5: dabangg 2 - 2012\nRow 6: bodyguard - 2011\nRow 7: dabangg - 2010\nRow 8: rowdy rathore - 2012\nRow 9: agneepath - 2012\nRow 10: ready - 2011\n\nSo \"ek tha tiger\" is in row 2 with the year 2012. Therefore, the claim that it was released in 2009 is incorrect because it actually came out in 2012.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim says \"in 2009 ek ta tiger be first release.\" So does it mean that in 2009, ektha tiger was the first movie to be released? Or just that it was released in 2009?\n\nLooking at the table, the movies' years go as low as 2010 (dabangg) and as high as 2013. The earliest release year is 2009 with \"3 idiots.\" So in 2009, \"3 idiots\" was released. Therefore, if the claim says ektha tiger was first released in 2009, that's not correct because it came out in 2012.\n\nSo, checking the relevant cells: we need to look for the year 2009 and the movie \"ek tha tiger.\" From the table, in row 3, the movie is \"3 idiots\" released in 2009. Therefore, the claim is referring to the wrong movie and the wrong year. So it's FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the rank. Let me check again: each row corresponds to a specific movie with their details. The claim says ektha tiger was first released in 2009. To verify this, we need to find if in 2009, ekta tiger was the first release. But since ekta tiger wasn't even released until 2012, that's impossible. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the row where \"ek tha tiger\" is listed and the year column for that movie, which is 2012. So the row index is 1 (since it's the second entry) but wait, in the table, row numbers start at 1 as rank 1, so ektha tiger is at rank 2, which would correspond to row_index=1? Or does the first row have row_index=0 or something? Wait, no, the table lists rank starting from 1, so row 1 is chennai express, row 2 is ektha tiger. So in the JSON, we need to map it as row_index: 1 (since rows are zero-indexed in JSON objects, but the table's first row is rank 1). Wait no, actually, in the example given, the JSON uses row_index as an integer without specifying if it starts at 0 or 1. Looking back at the instructions, they have an example where \"row_index\" is 0 for the first entry. So perhaps the rows are zero-indexed.\n\nWait, in the sample, for example, the first entry has row_index: 0, so that would mean row 1 in the table corresponds to row_index=0. Wait no, let me look at the sample again:\n\nIn the example provided:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo row_index starts at 0 for the first entry. Therefore, in our table, ektha tiger is at rank 2, which would be row_index=1.\n\nSimilarly, 3 idiots are at rank 3, so row_index=2.\n\nTherefore, to confirm the claim, I need to look at row 1 (ektha tiger) and its year column. The movie's year is 2012, so that's not 2009.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For ektha tiger: row_index=1, column_name=\"year\"\n- For 2009: perhaps looking for which movie was released in 2009, but the claim doesn't specify another part. Wait, no, the claim is specifically about ektha tiger being first released in 2009. So we only need to check if ektha tiger's year is 2009 and whether it was the first release that year.\n\nBut since ektha tiger wasn't released until 2012, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the JSON should have:\n\n\"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n]\n\nWait, but maybe I need to also check if it's the first release in 2009. But since ektha tiger wasn't released in 2009, there's no point in checking other cells because the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check both the movie and its year. So the relevant cells would be row for ekta tiger (row_index=1) and its year column.\n\nTherefore, the JSON will include only that cell.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether \"ekta tiger\" was released in 2009 as the first film of that year. By examining the data, it's clear that \"ekta tiger\" was actually released in 2012. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
