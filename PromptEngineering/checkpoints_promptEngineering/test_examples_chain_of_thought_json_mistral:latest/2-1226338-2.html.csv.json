Identify the driver we are looking for: In this case, since the question does not specify a driver, it implies we need to check all drivers from 1984 and 1985.\n\n2. Find the points scored by each driver in 1984: Loop through the table to find rows where the \"year\" column is equal to 1984. We are interested in the \"points\" column for these rows, since they represent drivers from 1984. Let's call this total_1984_points.\n\n3. Find the points scored by each driver in 1985: Similarly, loop through the table again to find rows where the \"year\" column is equal to 1985. We are interested in the \"points\" column for these rows, since they represent drivers from 1985. Let's call this total_1985_points.\n\n4. Compare the points scored by each driver between 1984 and 1985: Subtract total_1984_points from total_1985_points to find out how many more points were scored in 1985 compared to 1984.\n\n5. Check if the difference is greater than or equal to 4: Compare the result of step 4 with 4 to see if it meets the claim's condition of being 4 or more points higher in 1985.\n\n6.

However, since we don't have any specific information about Marc Surer in this table, we can't proceed with this step.\n\n3.

But since the teams change over time, we can assume that a certain team with a specific year represents Marc Surer during that year.\n2. Find all the rows (entries) where the \"entrant\" column matches any variation of \"arrows\". This is because Marc Surer raced for Arrows Racing Team in the 1982 and 1983 seasons.\n3. For those entries, find the rows where the \"points\" column has a value greater than or equal to 4 (since we are looking for instances when he scored 4 points or more). This will help us determine if he ever scored 4 points or more in any year.\n4. Since the claim asks about scoring 4 points less than a score of 0 points, if we find a row where the \"points\" column is greater than or equal to 4, it means that he has never scored 4 points less than he scored 0 points (because a negative number of points would imply he scored less than 0 points which is not possible in this dataset).\n5.
