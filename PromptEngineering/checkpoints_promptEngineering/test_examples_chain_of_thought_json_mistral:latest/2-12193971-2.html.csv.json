To do this, find the row in the \"data\" array where the \"club\" column matches \"real murcia\". In this case, it's the first row with index 0.\n2. Once we have identified Real Murcia, find its points. The points are stored in the \"points\" column for each team. For Real Murcia, the points are given as \"47 + 9\". We need to convert this into a numeric value by adding 47 (from the string) and 9 (the number within the string).\n3. After finding the points for Real Murcia, compare them with the points of other teams in the table. To do this, loop through the rest of the \"data\" array and find the \"points\" column for each team. Compare the numeric value obtained for Real Murcia with the numeric values found for other teams.\n4.
