    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the condition to be checked: The claim states that the \"lifetime india share\" of movies released before 2009 should be 0.\n2. Determine the earliest year in the data set: From the table, we can see that the earliest movie is from 2009.\n3. Compare each row's year with the earliest year: Iterate through the rows and compare the \"year\" column value with the earliest year (2009). If a row's year is equal to or earlier than 2009, check if its corresponding \"lifetime india distributor share\" is 0.\n4. Check for any exceptions: If there's a row where the year is equal to or earlier than 2009 but its \"lifetime india distributor share\" is not 0, then the claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release in 2009.\n\n2. Determine the relevant columns: To verify this, we need to compare the year of release and the movie name with the data in the table. The relevant columns for comparison are \"year\" and \"movie\".\n\n3. Analyze the data: Compare each row's \"year\" value with 2009 and check if the \"movie\" matches \"ek tha tiger\". If both conditions are met, the movie is a possible match for the claim.\n\n4. Verify the claim: Go through all the rows in the table and check if any row satisfies both conditions.

Understand the columns: The columns are \"rank\", \"movie\", \"year\", \"studio (s)\", and \"lifetime india distributor share\".\n4. Find the relevant rows: To answer the claim, we need to find all movies released in 2010. In this table, there is only one movie (\"agneepath\") with a \"year\" of 2010.\n5. Compare the ranks: Since there is only one movie from 2010, its rank will be the smallest among all movies (rank 9).\n6.
