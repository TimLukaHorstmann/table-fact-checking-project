    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is 'ipatinga'.\n2. Locate the row that corresponds to 'ipatinga' in the data array. In this table, it's at index 20.\n3. Check the columns \"played\", \"lost\", and \"drawn\" for 'ipatinga'. The values are 38 (for played), 21 (for lost), and there is no entry for drawn. Since the data does not contain a drawn value, we will assume it's 0 in this context.\n4. Compare the number of games 'ipatinga' has lost against the given limit of 14. In this case, 'ipatinga' has lost more than 14 games (21 > 14).\n5. Check if 'ipatinga' has drawn 8 or fewer games. Since there is no entry for drawn and we are assuming it's 0 in this context, the number of drawn games is less than or equal to 8 (0 <= 8).\n6. Conclusion: The claim is TRUE as 'ipatinga' has lost more than 14 games out of 38 games played, and they have also drawn fewer than or equal to 8 games.\n\nHere's the final JSON object with my reasoning and answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team we are looking for\",\n    \"Locate the row that corresponds to 'ipatinga'\",\n    \"Check the columns 'played', 'lost', and (assumption) 'drawn' for 'ipatinga'\",\n    \"Compare the number of games 'ipatinga' has lost against the given limit of 14\",\n    \"Check if 'ipatinga' has drawn 8 or fewer games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    // Since there is no entry for 'drawn' and we are assuming it's 0 in this context\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team for which we need to find the points difference: The team is \"sport\".\n2. Find the row in the table corresponding to the identified team: In this table, the row with the team name \"sport\" is row 11.\n3. Determine the column index of the 'difference' value: The position of 'difference' in the columns array is 6.\n4. Find the 'points' value for the same row: In the row corresponding to \"sport\", the points value is found at the column with an index of 2.\n5. Compare the values of the difference and points columns for the identified team: The difference value for \"sport\" (from step 3) is \"-9\" and the points value for \"sport\" (from step 4) is 52.\n6. Determine whether the claim is true or false by comparing the calculated difference with the provided number: Calculate the difference between the points and difference values, which results in a value of 61 - (-9) = 70. The claim states that \"sport have a difference of 3 with 52 point\", so the calculated difference (70) does not match the expected difference (3).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team in question: 'sport'.

This can be found by iterating through the 'data' array and checking for the team name.\n2. Second, if a match is found, we then check its total points from the 'points' column to verify if it equals 75 or not.\n3. Third, since the claim mentions that the team played less than 30 games, we will check the 'played' column for the matching row to ensure this condition is met.\n4.
