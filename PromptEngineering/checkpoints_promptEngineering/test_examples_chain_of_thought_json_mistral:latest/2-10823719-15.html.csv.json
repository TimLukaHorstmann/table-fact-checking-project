    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is about a match on July 14, 1979, at VFL Park, where the away team (Geelong) scored 11.12 (78).\n\n2. Check if the table provides information about all matches on July 14, 1979: The table has multiple entries with the date \"14 july 1979\", so it does seem to contain information about all matches from that day.\n\n3. Find the relevant row in the table for VFL Park: Since we know the venue (VFL Park) and the correct date, we can look for a row where both the \"venue\" and \"date\" match the claim.\n\n4. Verify if the away team in the found row is Geelong: If the home team is Geelong or there's no team mentioned because it's the away team, then that would mean our claimed team doesn't match the table data. However, since the table does not have an explicit field for identifying the home or away teams, we will compare the values in the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns against Geelong.\n\n5. Check if the away team score on that row matches 11.12 (78): After finding the correct row, check if the value in the \"away team score\" column is equal to \"11.12 (78)\".\n\nNow, let's find the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Check if table contains all matches on claimed date\",\n    \"Find relevant row based on venue and date\",\n    \"Verify if the away team in the found row is Geelong\",\n    \"Check if the away team score on that row matches the claimed score\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
