The relevant rows are those with the team column equal to \"sint - truiden\". There are two such rows in the data (row indices 0 and 5).\n\n2. Inspect each identified row to see if there is a change of management. That is, check if the outgoing manager for each row is Val\u00e8re Billen. If it is, then we have found the initial change of management (from Val\u00e8re Billen to Peter Voets). This condition holds for row 0 because its outgoing manager is indeed Val\u00e8re Billen.\n\n3. Next, see if there is another change of management involving Peter Voets in his second tenure at \"sint - truiden\". This means checking if the replaced by value for the row where Peter Voets was a manager (row 5) is not empty. The replaced by value for row 5 is Dennis van wijk, which is non-empty.\n\n4. Finally, verify that this second change of management (from Peter Voets to Dennis van wijk) follows directly after the first change of management. This requires checking if the date of appointment for the row where Peter Voets was a manager (row 5) is the same as or later than the date of vacancy for the initial change of management (row 0). The date of appointment for row 5 (10 december 2007) is indeed later than the date of vacancy for row 0 (18 september 2007), which confirms that the second change of management happened after the first one.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim \"peter voets take the place of outgo manager val\u00e8re billen and then peter voets be replace by dennis van wijk\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where Peter Voets was a manager (team = 'sint - truiden')\",\n    \"Check if Val\u00e8re Billen was the outgoing manager for one of these rows\",\n    \"Verify that there is another change of management involving Peter Voets in his second tenure at 'sint - truiden'\",\n    \"Ensure that the second change of management happened after the first one by comparing their respective dates\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"replaced by\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the teams for each manager named in the claim. The teams are genk (for Hugo Broos), mon (for Jos\u00e9 Riga), and brussels (for Albert Cartier).\n\n2. Check if the team and manager data match in any row of the table. If we find a matching row where the 'team' matches the teams mentioned in the claim, and the 'outgoing manager' matches either Hugo Broos, Jos\u00e9 Riga, or Albert Cartier, then we can conclude that they left their team in the 2007-2008 season.\n\n3. Iterate through each row of the table to check for matching teams and managers.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the teams for each manager named in the claim. 2. Check if the team and manager data match in any row of the table.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
