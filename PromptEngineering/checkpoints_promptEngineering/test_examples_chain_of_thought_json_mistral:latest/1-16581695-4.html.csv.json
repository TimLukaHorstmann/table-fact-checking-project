    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that the 15th episode in the third season has production code 315.\n2. Determine the number of episodes in the table: To find out the total number of episodes, count the rows in the \"data\" array. In this case, there are 44 rows.\n3. Identify the starting point for each season: Since the seasons start with row index 1 (as opposed to 0), the first row is not part of any season. So, we will start counting episodes from row index 2.\n4. Determine the number of episodes in each season: Calculate the number of rows per season by subtracting the starting point from the total number of rows and then incrementing it for each season. For example, for the third season, you would subtract 2 from 44 and get 42, as there are 42 rows left to consider after accounting for the first two rows that do not belong to any season.\n5. Identify the episode number of the 15th episode in the third season: Count the episodes in the third season by incrementing the row index (starting from the second row) until you reach the 14th episode, and then move to the next row for the 15th episode. In this case, since there are 42 rows left after accounting for the first two rows, and we have counted 14 rows already, we move to the 43rd (or the second last) row.\n6. Find the production code of the identified episode: Check the sixth column in the identified row. In this case, the production code for the 15th episode in the third season is stored in the cell with row_index = 42 and column_name = \"production code\".\n7.
