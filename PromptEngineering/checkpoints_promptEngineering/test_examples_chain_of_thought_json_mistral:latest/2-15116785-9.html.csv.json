The \"score\" column contains the scores in the format (a1, a2, a3), where a1, a2, and a3 are the individual judge's scores.\n   3. Iterate through the data to find Shannon & Derek's row: Since the claim involves Shannon & Derek, we need to focus on their row in the table. We can do this by looking for their name in the \"couple\" column of each row.\n   4. Verify the score matches the claim: Once we have found Shannon & Derek's row, we compare their \"score\" (in the format a1, a2, a3) with the given claim (24).
