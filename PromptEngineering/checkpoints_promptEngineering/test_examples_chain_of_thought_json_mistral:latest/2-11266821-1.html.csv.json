Check if the titles are different: For each role, we check if the title associated with it is different. In this case, the first role's title is \"My Old Sweetheart\" and the second role's title is \"Tell Me Something\". These two titles are not the same, so they satisfy the condition of being from 2 different titles.\n6. Check if the directors are different: For each role, we also check if the director associated with it is different. In this case, the first role's director is Shin Seung - Soo and the second role's director is Jang Yoon - Hyun. These two directors are not the same people, as they have different names.\n7.
