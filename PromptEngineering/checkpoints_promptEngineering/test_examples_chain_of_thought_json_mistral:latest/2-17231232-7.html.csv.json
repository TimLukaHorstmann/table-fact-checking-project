Determine the column containing the score: The score column in the table is named \"score\" (as per the 'columns' array).\n3. Check the row containing the data related to the player: We find the relevant row by looking for the player's name in each row of the 'data' array. In this case, we see that Chip Beck's data is in the second row.\n4. Extract the score from the data: The score for a player can be found in the corresponding row under the \"score\" column. For Chip Beck, his score is 281 (as per the cell [0] of the second row).\n5. Compare the extracted score with the claim's value: Check whether the extracted score matches the value provided in the claim for Chip Beck. In this case, the score in the table (281) matches the claimed score (281).\n6.
