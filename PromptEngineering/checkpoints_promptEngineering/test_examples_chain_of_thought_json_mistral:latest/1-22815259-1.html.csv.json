Determine what data in the table corresponds to the Cowboys' scores and results. The relevant columns are \"result\" (which indicates the outcome of each game) and \"cowboys points\" (which shows the number of points the Cowboys scored).\n3. Scan through the rows in the \"data\" array, checking if there is a row where both the \"result\" value is \"win\" and the \"cowboys points\" value is 23.\n4. Find such a row: In this table, the third row (row_index=2) has a result of \"win\" and cowboys points of 27, which does not match the claim. We continue scanning through the rows.\n5. Locate another relevant row: The first row (row_index=1) has a result of \"win\" and cowboys points of 23, which matches the claim.\n6.
