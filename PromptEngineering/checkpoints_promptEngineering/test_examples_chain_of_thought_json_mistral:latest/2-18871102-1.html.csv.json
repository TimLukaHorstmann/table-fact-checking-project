Identify the claim: The claim states that the conference named 'olympic' has an IHSAA class / football / soccer of 4a / 5a / 2a and joined after 1926.\n\n2. Find the relevant row in the table: The conference name 'olympic' is associated with Huntington North High School, so we look for this school's data. In our table, the row index for Huntington North High School is 1.\n\n3. Check the IHSAA class / football / soccer column: In the selected row, the value in the 'ihsaa class / football / soccer' column is \"4a / 5a / 2a\". This matches the claim's requirement for this school to be in the 4a, 5a, and 2a classes for football, soccer, and other sports respectively.\n\n4. Check the year joined: In the selected row, the value in the 'year joined' column is 2003.

In this case, the third row in the 'data' array is relevant.\n\n4. Compare the mascot and year joined: Once we found the relevant row, we compare the values in the \"mascot\" and \"year joined\" columns to ensure they match the claim's mascot (vikings) and year joined (2003).
