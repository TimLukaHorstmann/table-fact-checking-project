Loop through each row of the data array to find rows that match the identified seasons.\n\n3. For each season-matching row, check if the \"score\" column has values representing a 1:0 score. This requires checking both parts of the score separated by a colon (\":\"). The first part is the home team's score and the second part is the away team's score.\n\n4. If any of the season-matching rows have a 1:0 score, mark those rows as relevant.\n\n5. Count the number of season-matching rows with a 1:0 score.\n\n6. Compare the count from step 5 with the total number of season-matching rows found in step 2. If both values are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify seasons in the claim.\",\n    \"Loop through each row of the data array to find rows that match the identified seasons.\",\n    \"For each season-matching row, check if the 'score' column has values representing a 1:0 score.\",\n    \"If any of the season-matching rows have a 1:0 score, mark those rows as relevant.\",\n    \"Count the number of season-matching rows with a 1:0 score.\",\n    \"Compare the count from step 5 with the total number of season-matching rows found in step 2.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"score\" }, // 2006 clausura\n    { \"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"score\" } // 2008 apertura\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to validate the claim:\n\n1. Identify all the rows where the score column shows a value of \"0:1\". This will give us the matches where both teams scored once, but one team scored zero goals at home and the other scored one goal away.\n2. For each of these matches, extract the season from the first column to identify which seasons have at least one match with a score of \"0:1\".\n3. Compare the extracted seasons with the seasons listed in the claim.\n\nNow let's find the rows where the score is \"0:1\" and extract their seasons:\n\n- Find row indices of matches with a score of \"0:1\": [2, 9, 16, 25]\n- Extract seasons for these matches: [\"2011 clausura\", \"2010 apertura\", \"2006 clausura\", \"2007 apertura\"]\n\nSince the claim lists three different seasons (\"2006 clausura\", \"2008 apertura\", and \"2006 clausura\"), it is FALSE because not all of the seasons found in the table match the claimed seasons.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find matches where score is '0:1'\",\n    \"Extract seasons for these matches\",\n    \"Compare extracted seasons with claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"season\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
