    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that on June 19, 1971, Carlton has the smallest margin of victory among all games played that day.\n\n2. Determine the relevant data for each game: For each game, we need to find the home team score and away team score. These will help us calculate the margin of victory (home_team_score - away_team_score).\n\n3. Calculate the margin of victory for each game: Iterate through the \"data\" array and for each row, subtract the value in the 'away team score' column from the value in the 'home team score' column. This will give us the margin of victory for each game played on June 19, 1971.\n\n4. Compare the margins of victory: After calculating the margin of victory for all games, compare them to find the smallest one. The smallest margin indicates which team had the smallest victory margin.\n\n5. Verify the result against the home team: Once we have found the smallest margin of victory, check if the corresponding home team is Carlton. If it is, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and relevant data\",\n    \"Calculate margin of victory for each game\",\n    \"Compare margins of victory to find smallest one\",\n    \"Verify the smallest margin corresponds to Carlton\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    ...
