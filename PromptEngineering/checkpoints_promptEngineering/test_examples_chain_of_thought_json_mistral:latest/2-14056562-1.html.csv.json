Compare the event type and year for each row: Check if the event in the current row is a marathon and if the year is 2000.\n\n5.

Determine which data represents the positions in the table: The column named \"position\".\n3. Check if there is a row that contains a position equal to 3: To find out, we need to check every row and see if the \"position\" value matches 3.\n4. Compare the finishing times for the rows where the position equals 3: If a matching row exists, compare its finishing time (if any) with 2:12:53.\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's find the relevant cells:\n1. To check if the third position is present in the data:\n   - { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\" }\n\n2. If a matching row is found (in this case, it is), to compare its finishing time with 2:12:53:\n   - { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"notes\" }\n\nNow let's find the final answer:\nThe relevant cell contains a value of 2:12:53.

Determine which row corresponds to the 3rd position: Since we are looking for the position \"3rd\", we need to find the row where the 'position' column is equal to \"3rd\".

Check if there are notes in the selected row: If the value of the 'notes' column in the selected row is not empty or not equal to \"dnf\", then it contradicts the claim that the position doesn't have a note. In our table, the 'notes' for the 3rd position (row with index 2) is \"2:12:53\".\n\n4.
