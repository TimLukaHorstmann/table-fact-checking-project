Extract the relevant data from the table for the episode 's07e05'. This can be found in the 'data' array of the json object, and the row with the index 4 has the data for this episode.\n\n3. Check the values of 'segment c' and 'episode' in the extracted row. If they match the required value ('sandwich s cookie' and 's07e05'), then the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\",\n    \"Extract relevant data for the episode from the table\",\n    \"Check if 'segment c' and 'episode' values match the required values\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"segment c\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"episode\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
