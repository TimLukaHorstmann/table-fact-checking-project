Iterate through each row of the data array to find the row corresponding to May 28. To do this, compare the date value in each row with \"may 28\" (note that the dates are not in the standard YYYY-MM-DD format, so we just compare the month and day).\n3. Once the correct row is found, extract the record value from it by looking for the column name \"record\". This will give us the number following the dash.\n4. Compare the extracted record value with \"27 - 24\". The '-' in the record value indicates a hyphenated string, so we split the record at the '-', and compare each part to '27' and '24'.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column for record, iterate through data rows, find row of May 28, extract record value, split at '-', compare extracted values with '27' and '24'.\", \"\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 56,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
