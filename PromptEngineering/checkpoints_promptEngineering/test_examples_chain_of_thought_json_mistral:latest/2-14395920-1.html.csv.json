Since Brice Feillu appears on a \"mountain stage\" (column type), and Thor Hushovd appears on a \"flat stage\" (column type), we don't need to consider the stage types in determining the order of their appearances.\n5. The claim states that Brice Feillu should win a flat stage before Thor Hushovd. Since Brice Feillu comes earlier in the table, which implies he appeared first during the tournament, and since his victory was on a mountain stage, it means that his flat stage victory (if any) must have occurred earlier than Thor Hushovd's flat stage win.\n6. As we don't have enough information from the table to confirm if Brice Feillu won a flat stage before Thor Hushovd, I will assume for this answer that there are no repeated stages in the tournament.
