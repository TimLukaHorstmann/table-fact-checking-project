Understand the table structure: The table consists of a list of rows, each row representing data for one player. The columns in the table are \"pick\", \"player\", \"country of origin\", \"pba team\", and \"college\".\n3. Locate the relevant row: To find Benito Cheng's data, we look through the rows until we find the row where the \"player\" column matches \"benito cheng\". In this table, that row is at index 5.\n4. Check the pick value: Once we have found the relevant row, we check the value in the \"pick\" column for that row. In this case, the value is 5.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Understand table structure\", \"Locate the relevant row\", \"Check the pick value\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}]\n   }",
