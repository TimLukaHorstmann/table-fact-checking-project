Find relevant rows in the table: Look for a row where the \"programme\" column matches \"art attack\".\n\n4. Examine the found row: Check if the \"original channel (s)\" column of the matching row contains \"citv\".\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is \"big brother will return on September 9, 2011\".\n\n2. Extract relevant data from the table: To verify the claim, we need to find all rows where the \"programme\" is \"big brother\".\n\n3. Check the extracted data: For each row where the \"programme\" is \"big brother\", look at the \"date of return\" to see if it matches September 9, 2011.\n\n4. Compare the extracted data with the claim: If there exists a row where the \"programme\" is \"big brother\" and the \"date of return\" matches September 9, 2011, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant rows:\n- Row 1: programme = big brother, date of return = 18 august 2011 (FALSE)\n- Row 2: programme = big brother, date of return = 9 september 2011 (potential match, so this row is relevant)\n\nSince there exists a row where the \"programme\" is \"big brother\" and the \"date of return\" matches September 9, 2011, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Extract relevant data\", \"Check extracted data\", \"Compare with claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of return\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the table structure and understand what each column represents (programme, date of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, new channel(s)).\n2. Locate the row in the data array that corresponds to the programme \"born to be different\". The row number can be found by iterating through the data array and comparing the 'programme' column with the given claim.\n3. Examine the date of return value for this row. If it matches the provided claim (\"18 august 2011\"), then the answer is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n4. Compare the date of return value in the table (\"9 june 2011\") with the claimed date (\"18 august 2011\"). The values do not match, so the claim is FALSE.\n5.
