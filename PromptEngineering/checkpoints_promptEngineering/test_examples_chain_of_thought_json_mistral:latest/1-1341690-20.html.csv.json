In our table, there is no row for Maryland District 7 that matches the district column with \"maryland 7\". However, it appears that Goodloe Byron was a previous incumbent for this district (in rows 4 and 5).\n\n4. Since the table does not contain information about current incumbents or candidates for Maryland District 7, we cannot definitively confirm whether Goodloe Byron or Elton R Wampler were candidates in this district.\n\nWith this explanation, here is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the structure of the table and understand the meaning of each column.\",\n    \"Examine the claim to determine which candidate(s) we are looking for in Maryland District 7\",\n    \"Find the relevant row(s) based on the district name\",\n    \"Check if Goodloe Byron or Elton R Wampler appear as incumbents or candidates in this district\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"candidates\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

If the incumbent was re-elected, and his name is indeed \"parren mitchell\", then I will check the candidates to see if there exists a candidate named \"elton r wampler\" who lost against him.
