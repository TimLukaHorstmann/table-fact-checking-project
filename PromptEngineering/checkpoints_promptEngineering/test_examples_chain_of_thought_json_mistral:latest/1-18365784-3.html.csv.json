The table has columns named \"departure\", \"going to\", \"calling at\", \"arrival\", and \"operator\".\n2. The claim states that a train departs from 'halton holegate, spilsby' at 18.16. To verify this, we need to check if there is an entry in the table where both \"calling at\" matches \"halton holegate, spilsby\" and \"departure\" equals \"18.16\".\n3. If such a row exists, it would be evidence supporting the claim. Otherwise, it would mean that no train departs from 'halton holegate, spilsby' at 18.16, disproving the claim.\n4.
