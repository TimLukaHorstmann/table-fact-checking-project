Identify the claim requirements: The claim states that we need to find the transmitter location that has a digital power of 570 kw and air date before 30 December 1989.\n\n2. Determine the relevant columns in the table: Since we are interested in \"digital power\" and \"on - air date\", these columns are relevant for our search.\n\n3. Scan through the data to find a match: We will go through each row (each transmitter location) and check if its digital power is 570 kw and on-air date is before 30 December 1989.\n\n4. If we find such a match, the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nNow let's check the data:\n\n- The first row's digital power is 50 kw, on-air date is after 30 December 1989, so it doesn't match the claim.\n- The second row's digital power is 570 kw, on-air date is before 30 December 1989, but it doesn't meet the requirement for the transmitter location (it should be mount canobolas). So even though we found a transmitter with the correct digital power, it's not the one specified in the claim.\n- The third row's digital power is 600 kw, on-air date is after 30 December 1989, so it doesn't match the claim.\n- The fourth row's digital power is 250 kw (not 570 kw), on-air date is before 30 December 1989, so it doesn't match the claim.\n- The fifth row's digital power is 600 kw, on-air date is after 30 December 1989, so it doesn't match the claim.\n\nSince no match was found that satisfies both conditions (digital power = 570 kw and on-air date before 30 December 1989 at mount canobolas), the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim requirements: digital power = 570 kw, on-air date before 30 Dec 1989; Determine relevant columns: digital power and on - air date; Scan through the data to find a match\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"digital power\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"on - air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"digital power\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"on - air date\"}\n  ]\n}",
