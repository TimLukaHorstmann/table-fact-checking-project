    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that 90 games have been played for the series of the Sawhorse Dollar trophy.\n\n2. Find the relevant data: We need to find the row in the table where the trophy name matches \"sawhorse dollar\".\n\n3. Verify the number of games played: Once we've found the correct row, we will check the number of games played column for the value 90.\n\n4. Compare the findings with the claim: If the number of games played (from step 3) matches the claim (i.e., 90), then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nBased on my analysis, here's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the relevant data (trophy name)\", \"Verify the number of games played (90) and compare with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"trophy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe claim is true because the relevant row in the table shows that trophy name matches 'sawhorse dollar' and there have been 90 games played for that series.",
