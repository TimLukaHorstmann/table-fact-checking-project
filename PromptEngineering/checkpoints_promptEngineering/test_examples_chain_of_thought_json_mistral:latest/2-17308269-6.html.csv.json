Identify the column names to find the relevant data about each player's nationality, team, former team, college/country/team, and whether their current or former WNBA team is Connecticut Sun.\n2. Scan through the table (data array) to find a row where the \"player\" matches \"ann strother (g)\" and the \"college / country / team\" column provides information about where they are from.\n3. Check if the value in the \"college / country / team\" for the corresponding row is Connecticut or any other representation of Connecticut (e.g., CT).\n4. If the value matches, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let me provide the final answer with relevant cells:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column names to find player-related information\",\n    \"Scan through the table to find a row where the 'player' matches 'ann strother (g)', and check if 'college / country / team' provides information about their origin\",\n    \"Check if the value in the 'college / country / team' for the corresponding row is Connecticut or any other representation of Connecticut (e.g., CT)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if 'ann strother (g)' has a row in the table, and observe her nationality, college / country / team, new WNBA team, and former WNBA team.\n3. Compare the column 'college / country / team' for 'ann strother (g)' with 'connecticut'. If it matches, then proceed to check the former WNBA team. If not, then the claim is false because she has played in the WNBA already and did not start at 'connecticut'.\n4. Check if 'indiana fever' matches the value of 'former wnba team' for 'ann strother (g)'. If it does, then the claim is false because she has played for 'indiana fever'. If not, then proceed to the next step.\n5. The claim states that 'ann strother (g)' has never played on 'indiana fever', so it is enough to have not found her in the list of former WNBA teams as 'indiana fever'.\n\nanswer: \"FALSE\"\nrelevant_cells: [\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"\n  }\n]",
