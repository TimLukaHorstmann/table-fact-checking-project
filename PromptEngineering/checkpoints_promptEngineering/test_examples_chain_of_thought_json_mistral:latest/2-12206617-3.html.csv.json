    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team name from the claim: The Toronto Blue Jays are not explicitly mentioned in the table, so we need to find a team that could represent the Blue Jays. In this dataset, teams like \"Rangers\", \"Royals\", and \"White Sox\" do not match the Blue Jays, but \"athletics\" might be a possibility since they were known as the Oakland Athletics during the 1991 season and were sometimes referred to informally as the \"A's,\" which could resemble \"Blue Jays.\"\n\n2. Filter the data for the month of May: Since the table does not have explicit dates with year information, we cannot confirm that this is indeed the 1991 season, but all the dates listed are in May so it should be safe to assume that these games happened during May of a particular year.\n\n3. Filter the data for rows where the team name is \"athletics\" to focus on potential Blue Jays (A's) games: There are multiple instances of \"athletics\" in the table, so we need to examine each one to see if any have an attendance greater than 5000.\n\n4. Loop through each row where the team name is \"athletics\" and check the \"attendance\" column for values greater than 5000: We will find the relevant cells if we find an instance of \"athletics\" with an attendance greater than 5000.\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's perform a manual search through the data:\n\n- First row where team name is \"athletics\": attendance = 24631 (greater than 5000)\n- Second row where team name is \"athletics\": attendance = 22738 (less than 5000)\n- Third row where team name is \"athletics\": attendance = 34028 (greater than 5000)\n- Fourth row where team name is \"athletics\": attendance = 50299 (greater than 5000)\n- Fifth row where team name is \"athletics\": attendance = 50262 (greater than 5000)\n- Sixth row where team name is \"athletics\": attendance = 50271 (greater than 5000)\n- Seventh row where team name is \"athletics\": attendance = 50252 (greater than 5000)\n\nSince we found multiple instances of the \"athletics\" team with an attendance greater than 5000, it appears that the Toronto Blue Jays (represented by the \"athletics\" team in this dataset) played in at least 8 games with an attendance greater than 5000 during May of a certain year.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team from the claim (Toronto Blue Jays are not explicitly mentioned, but 'athletics' might represent them)\",\n    \"Filter the data for May\",\n    \"Focus on rows where the team name is 'athletics'\",\n    \"Loop through each row and check the 'attendance' column for values greater than 5000\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
