    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the columns in the table that contain data relevant to the claim. In this case, we need the \"year born\" column to calculate the age difference between players.\n2. Iterate through each row of the \"data\" array to extract the year of birth for each player and store them in a separate variable (e.g., `birth_years`).\n3. Determine the oldest player by finding the maximum value in the `birth_years` list. Let's assume that this is the year 1972 (row index 2).\n4. Determine the youngest player by finding the minimum value in the `birth_years` list. Let's assume that this is the year 1975 (row index 3).\n5. Calculate the age difference between the oldest and youngest players by subtracting the year of birth of the youngest player from the year of birth of the oldest player. In this case, the difference would be (1972 - 1975) = -3 years. Since we are looking for a positive number, we can consider this as an 11-year difference because the actual difference is 11 + 3 = 14 years. However, since the claim asks for an 11-year differential, we consider it as not meeting the exact requirement, but still within the 11-year range.\n6. To meet the strict requirement of a 11-year differential, we need to ensure that there are no players in between these two extremes with birth years within this range. Iterate through the `birth_years` list again, and for each year, find the index of the corresponding player in the \"data\" array (e.g., using a dictionary or hash map) to check if there are any intervening players.\n7. If there are no players with birth years between 1972 and 1975, then we can consider that the table satisfies the strict requirement of an 11-year differential between the youngest and oldest player. However, it's essential to check the `birth_years` list for any inconsistencies or errors in data entry to ensure our conclusion is accurate.\n8. Based on the reasoning provided above, we can see that there are no players with birth years within the range of 1972 and 1975 in this table.
