The twenty-fourth row has Minnesota as the home team (instead of California), and the score is 3 - 7, which doesn't match any of the required scores.\n25. The last row has Los Angeles as the visitor, but the score is 3 - 1, not a match for the required scores.\n\nSince we did not find two rows with California as the visitor and scores matching the required values (0 - 2 and 2 - 3), the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns: date, visitor, score. Check if 'visitor' matches California for two games with scores 0 - 2 and 2 - 3.\", \"Iterate through each row in the data array.\", \"Check if 'visitor' is California for two different rows.\", \"For each row where 'visitor' is California, check if score matches either 0 - 2 or 2 - 3.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
