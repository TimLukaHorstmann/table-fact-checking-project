The table contains data about the results of a world judo championship, and the claim states that France has 4 gold and 1 silver with a total of 8.\n2.

Check the columns of the matched row for gold, silver, and total medals. The values in the gold, silver, and total columns for this row are 4, 1, and 8 respectively.\n4. Compare these values with the claim. The number of gold medals (4) and silver medals (1) for France match the claim, and the total of these two (4+1=5) also matches the claim. However, the total medal count according to the table is 8 and not 9 as implied by the claim.\n5.
