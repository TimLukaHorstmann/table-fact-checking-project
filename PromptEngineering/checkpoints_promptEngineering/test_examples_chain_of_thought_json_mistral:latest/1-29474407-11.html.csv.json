Identify the claim statement: The claim states that the \"flieger - doppelpistole 1919\" was made in 2000, and its primary cartridge is 9x19 mm parabellum.\n\n2. Locate the relevant data in the table: We will search for the row where the \"name / designation\" column matches \"flieger - doppelpistole 1919\". In this case, the matching row index is 1.\n\n3. Check if the year of introduction matches the claim: The year of introduction for the found row is 1919, which is not equal to 2000.\n\n4. Check if the primary cartridge matches the claim: The primary cartridge for the found row is \"7.65x21 mm parabellum\", which does not match with \"9x19 mm parabellum\".\n\n5.

The relevant cells are [0, \"name / designation\"].\n3. If found, check the year of introduction. Since no specific year is given in the claim, it doesn't matter if there is a mismatch in this field.\n4. Check the primary cartridge of the gun. In the table data, we find the row where \"name / designation\" matches \"neal submachine gun\", and the primary cartridge in this row is \"22lr\".\n5. Compare this information with the claim's statement about the country of origin and primary cartridge. The country of origin given in the table for the \"neal submachine gun\" is \"united states\", but the claim does not specify a country of origin, so there is no mismatch here. However, the primary cartridge in the table is \"22lr\", while the claim mentions \"9x19 mm parabellum\".\n6.
