In this case, those rows are [0], [1], [2], [4], [6], and [9].\n\n2. Next, we need to determine which of these goals were scored in World Cup or World Cup Qualifier games. The \"competition\" column will help us with that. Goals from rows 0, 1, 2, and 9 were not scored in any World Cup or World Cup Qualifier game as they have the value \"friendly\".

Output the final answer based on the comparison made above: If the minimum score found is 3 or less, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team from venue names (assuming all games are for Germany), Find the lowest final score of the team by examining 'result' column values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",
