    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the relevant data in the table: We are given a claim about the runner-up (the second place finisher) named \"rick huiskamp\" and we need to check if his margin of victory was 10 strokes.\n\n2. Locate the row in the table that contains rick huiskamp as the runner-up: We can see that rick huiskamp is the runner-up in the third row of the table (indicated by \"rick huiskamp\" under the \"runner - up\" column).\n\n3. Extract the margin of victory for the row containing rick huiskamp: The margin of victory is stored in the \"margin of victory\" column. For the row with rick huiskamp as runner-up, the value under the \"margin of victory\" column is \"10 strokes\".\n\n4. Compare the extracted margin of victory with the given claim: The given claim states that the runner-up \"rick huiskamp's margin of victory be 10 stroke\". Comparing this to the extracted value, we find that they match (both say 10 strokes).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant data in the table\",\n    \"Locate the row containing the player in question\",\n    \"Extract the margin of victory for the row\",\n    \"Compare the extracted value with the given claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up and finished with a single-digit margin of victory.\n\n2. Extract the relevant data for Rick Huiskamp from the table: Find the row in the data array where the \"runner - up\" column value is \"rick huiskamp\". In this case, it's the third row (index 2).\n\n3. Check if Rick Huiskamp is indeed a runner-up: Compare the \"runner - up\" value in the selected row with the claim. If they match, then Rick Huiskamp is a runner-up as per the table data.\n\n4. Check if Rick Huiskamp finished with a single-digit margin of victory: Analyze the \"margin of victory\" column value in the selected row and verify that it is less than 10 (a single-digit number).\n\n5.
