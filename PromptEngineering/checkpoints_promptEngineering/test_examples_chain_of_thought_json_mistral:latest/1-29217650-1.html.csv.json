Find the row that corresponds to this movie in the data table. The rows are indexed from 0 to the number of movies minus one. In this case, the row index is 0 since \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" is the first movie in the list.\n\n3. In the column that corresponds to December 28th, find the revenue for the selected movie. The columns are named as dates and the data values are revenues.
