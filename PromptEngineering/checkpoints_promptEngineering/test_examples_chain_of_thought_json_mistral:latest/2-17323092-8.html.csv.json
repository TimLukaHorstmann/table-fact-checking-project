Iterate through each row to find out the number of assists for every player during the month of March.\n3. Since the question is asking about Jose Calderon specifically, look for his rows in the table and record his assist values.\n4. After finding all the assist values for Jose Calderon, compare them with the rest of the players' assist values to find the maximum number of assists in March. Let's call this value 'max_assists'.\n5. Count the number of rows where Jose Calderon has an equal or higher number of assists compared to 'max_assists'. If this count is less than the total number of unique players, then it means that there are other players with more assists than Jose Calderon in March.\n6. If the count from step 5 is equal to the total number of unique players, then it indicates that Jose Calderon has had the maximum number of assists during the month of March. In this case, since there are multiple rows where Jose Calderon has the same number of assists as 'max_assists', he shares the top position with other players.\n7. The claim states that Jose Calderon has the \"second\" most high assists in March. If the count from step 5 is not equal to the total number of unique players, then it means that there is at least one player with more assists than Jose Calderon during March, and therefore he cannot be in the second position.\n8. Based on the analysis above, if we find a situation where there are multiple rows with the same maximum number of assists (which includes Jose Calderon's rows) and the count from step 5 is not equal to the total number of unique players, then the claim is false. If the count from step 5 is equal to the total number of unique players, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n- To find the maximum assists in March, we would need to look at every row in the \"high assists\" column, but there are no specific rows mentioned for this operation, so all rows are relevant: [{\"row_index\": 0}, {\"row_index\": 1}, ... , {\"row_index\": 73}]\n- To find Jose Calderon's assist values, we would need to look at the rows where his name is mentioned in the first column (Player Name), which are: [{\"row_index\": 0}, {\"row_index\": 2}, ... , {\"row_index\": 73}]\n\nFinally, let's determine whether Jose Calderon has the second most high assists in March.
