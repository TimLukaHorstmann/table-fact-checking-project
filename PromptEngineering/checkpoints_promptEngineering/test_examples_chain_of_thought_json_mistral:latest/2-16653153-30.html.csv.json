Compare the number of games won by the South Dragons to every other team in the table.\n4. If the number of games won by the South Dragons is greater than or equal to the number of games won by every other team, then they have won the most games in the season.\n5. In our data, the South Dragons have 73.33% wins, which can be converted to a whole number by multiplying by 100 (73) and rounding down since the percentage is given as 73.33, not exactly 73.00.\n6. Comparing this to every other team in the table:\n   - The Melbourne Tigers have 66.67% wins (66).\n   - The New Zealand Breakers have 60.00% wins (60).\n   - The Perth Wildcats have 56.67% wins (56).\n   - The Townsville Crocodiles and the Adelaide 36ers both have 56.67% wins (56).\n   - The Wollongong Hawks have 36.67% wins (36).\n   - The Sydney Spirit, Cairns Taipans, and Gold Coast Blaze all have 36.67% wins (36).\n7.
