Find the row in the data corresponding to this team by matching the club column with \"academia quintana fc\". The relevant row is row 0.\n3. Observe that the founded column of the relevant row contains 1969, which is the year of foundation for academia quintana fc.\n4. To check if it was found before all other teams, compare the founded year with every other team in the table (excluding the row we are currently considering). We do this by iterating through the data and comparing the \"founded\" column of each row with that of academia quintana fc.\n5. In this case, only one club (bayam\u00f3n fc) was founded in a later year (2009), which is after the year 1969 when academia quintana fc was established.\n6. Since bayam\u00f3n fc is the only team that was founded after academia quintana fc, and the claim specifies \"before all other teams\", we can conclude that the claim is true for academia quintana fc.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team (academia quintana fc)\", \"Find the row corresponding to this team\", \"Check the founded year of the relevant row\", \"Compare the founded year with every other team in the table\", \"Conclude based on the comparison\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}]\n   }",

Inspect the data row by row in the table to find the team with the latest founded year.\n4. Determine if that team's \"seasons in prsl\" column value includes only the current season or also seasons from the past.\n5. If the team has played in the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL) in previous seasons as well, then it is not the most recent team to join the PRSL. Otherwise, it is the most recent team to join the PRSL.\n\nBased on the data provided:\n1. The teams were founded in the following years: 1969, 2008 (twice), 2009 (thrice), 2010 (twice).\n2. Comparing these years, we can see that Fajardo FC was founded in 2010.\n3. Since the table lists all teams, we find Fajardo FC in the third row of the data array.\n4. In the \"seasons in prsl\" column for Fajardo FC, we find the value \"2010\". This indicates that it is only playing this season and not any previous ones.\n5.
