In golf, par indicates the number of strokes a skilled golfer would take on a hole under normal conditions. A score of -5 means a player is 5 strokes under par (also known as 5 under).\n\n2. Next, I search the data for a row where the \"to par\" value equals 5.\n\n3. I find one row with a \"to par\" value of 5, which corresponds to Mark Hensby. However, there are other rows with the same \"t3\" place value and \"4\" in the \"to par\" column. This indicates that these players also finished with a score 4 under par.\n\n4. Since all these players finished with a score 4 under par (and not 5 under par), I need to confirm whether any of them actually finished with a score of 5 under par as well. To do this, I would require additional data or context about the tournament that is not provided in the given table.\n\n5.
