Find the row in the data array that corresponds to this week number. In this table, rows are ordered by week, so we can search linearly for the row with a \"week\" value of 8.\n3. Check if the result column (column index 3) of the found row has the value \"w\", as per the claim.\n4. If the result is indeed \"w\", then check the score (in columns \"result\") to see if it matches the claimed score (65 - 20).\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis would be:\n- { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\" } (to confirm that the week number is indeed 8)\n- { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\" } (to confirm that the result is \"w\")\n- { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\" } (to verify that the score matches the claimed score, though this column contains summary information and not individual scores)\n\nIf all three of these cells match the claim, then the answer would be TRUE.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim details: The claim states that there is a result of \"w 65 - 20\" after week 9 on November 13, 1949.\n\n2. Locate the relevant data in the table: To find the result on a specific date, we need to look for rows where the 'date' matches November 13, 1949. We also want to ensure that the corresponding 'week' is less than or equal to 9.\n\n3. Check if the condition (result and week) is met: Compare each row in the data array to see if it satisfies both conditions specified above.\n\nWith this reasoning process, let's examine the relevant cells:\n- The relevant rows are indexes 8 and 12, as they correspond to November 13, 1949. However, since we want week 9 or earlier, only row 8 is relevant (week 8).\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim details: The result should be 'w 65 - 20', and it must occur after week 9 but on or before November 13, 1949\",\n    \"Locate the relevant data in the table: Look for rows where the 'date' is November 13, 1949, and 'week' is less than or equal to 9\",\n    \"Check if the condition (result and week) is met: Compare each row in the data array to see if it satisfies both conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
