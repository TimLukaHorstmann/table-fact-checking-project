Iterate through the table's rows to find a match for the home team identified above (Perth Wildcats).\n3. For each row, check if the \"home team\" matches with the Perth Wildcats.

Check if there exists a corresponding row where the \"away team\" column matches the team that played against the home team (Perth Wildcats) on the same date (29 November).\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the specific game for which we need to check the venue. The claim mentions the Melbourne Tigers, but it does not specify the date. We should look for games on November 29th since all other details in the table are provided for that day.\n\n2. Loop through each row of data and find the row where the \"home team\" or \"away team\" is equal to \"Melbourne Tigers\". In this case, we can directly compare with the \"home team\" as it's likely that our target game is a home match for Melbourne Tigers (otherwise, the away team would have been mentioned in the claim).\n\n3. If the row matches the condition from step 2, then check if the \"venue\" column of that row equals \"state sports centre\". This will confirm whether or not the November 29 Melbourne Tiger game was held at the state sports centre venue.\n\nAfter following these steps:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the specific game by date and team\",\n       \"Check if 'home team' equals 'Melbourne Tigers'\",\n       \"If yes, then check if 'venue' equals 'state sports centre'\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 6,\n         \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 6,\n         \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }",
