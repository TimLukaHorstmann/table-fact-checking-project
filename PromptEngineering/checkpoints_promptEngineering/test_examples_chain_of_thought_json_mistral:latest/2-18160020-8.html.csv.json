In this case, \u00e1lvaro campos plays for real murcia b.\n4. Identify teams that have no match with an average higher than 0.61: We compare the averages of each goalkeeper from step 2 (excluding \u00e1lvaro campos) to 0.61 and find that none of them played a match against a team whose goalkeeper has an average higher than 0.61.\n5. Final verification: We check if \u00e1lvaro campos plays for a team that had no match with any goalkeeper having an average higher than 0.61.
