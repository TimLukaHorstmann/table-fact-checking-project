In this table, it is the 6th row (november 6, orlando) and its record before the loss was 2 - 4.\n\n2. Check if there's another row where the team lost to Orlando again (to find the record after this second loss). The 15th row (november 25, orlando) is the next occurrence of a game between the same team.\n\n3. Note down the record after the second loss. In this case, it's 7 - 8 as seen in the 16th row (november 26, boston).\n\n4. Compare the noted-down records to confirm if they match the claim. If the team dropped its record to 7 - 8 after losing to Orlando for a second time, then the claim is true.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row index of the first loss against Orlando (6), and note down its record (2-4).\",\n    \"Find the next occurrence of a game between this team and Orlando (15) and note down the record after the second loss (7-8).\",\n    \"Compare the noted records to check if they match the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}",

Iterate through the data array to find rows where the 'team' column matches the team in question (Orlando).\n3. Count the number of wins and losses for the team (Orlando) by looking at the 'record' column for each row that matches Orlando. The 'record' value will be a string in the format \"w x - y (ot)\", where x is the number of wins and y is the number of losses, with an optional \"ot\" indicating an overtime game.\n4. Compare the count of wins and losses for the team against Orlando to see if it matches the given claim.\n\nBased on the provided data, the team 'Orlando' has 2 losses (88 - 98 and 94 - 96) and 1 win (125 - 91).
