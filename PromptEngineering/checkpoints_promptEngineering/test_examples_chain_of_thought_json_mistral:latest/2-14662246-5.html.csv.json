Check each row of data in the table to see if China won gold or silver. Gold indicates first place and silver indicates second place.\n3. Iterate through the rows and columns of the table, looking for the \"silver\" column and matching it with the value \"china\".\n4. If a match is found, then the claim \"China has a very strong team at the Asian Games, always places at least silver\" can be considered true since we have evidence of China placing second in one or more years.\n5. If no match is found after checking all rows, then the claim cannot be confirmed as true based on the given data, and it would be false.\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant cells:\n1. [1994, \"hiroshima\", \"chinese taipei\", \"south korea\", \"china\"] (row_index = 1)\n\nThe chain of thought leads to a TRUE answer, as China placed second (silver medal) in the year 1994.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the country: China\",\n    \"Check each row for China winning gold or silver\",\n    \"Iterate through rows and columns, looking for 'silver' and matching with 'china'\",\n    \"Find match in the second row (1994), so the claim is true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
