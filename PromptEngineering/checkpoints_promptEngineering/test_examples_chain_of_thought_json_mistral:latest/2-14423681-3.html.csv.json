    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditions for the claim: a bronze medal with more than 1 total medal count, fewer than 1 silver medal, and a rank of 8.\n2. Examine the table structure to understand the layout of data (columns are rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total).\n3. Look for rows that match the conditions: gold count > 0, bronze count > 1, silver count < 1, and rank = 8. No such row exists in the table.\n4. Since no row matches all the conditions, it can be concluded that there is no bronze medal with more than 1 medal total, fewer than 1 silver medal, and a rank of 8.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify conditions for claim\", \"Examine table structure\", \"Look for matching rows\", \"Conclude based on the absence of matching rows\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
