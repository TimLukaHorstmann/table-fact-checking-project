First, we identify the information that is relevant to determining whether a game was played on November 12:\n   - The date should be \"12 november\" (as per the given claim)\n   - The type of match could be either \"world cup 2006 qualifier\" or \"friendly\"\n   - One team playing should be Croatia, as all other teams in the table are related to Croatia in some way (opponent, host, etc.)\n   - To find out who Croatia was playing against on November 12, we need to look for a row where the date matches and the fourth column (team Croatia is playing against) contains relevant information.\n\n2. After scanning the table, we see that there's no match on November 12 listed as a \"world cup 2006 qualifier\" for Croatia. However, there is a row with the date \"12 november\" and the type of match as \"friendly\", which is between Portugal and Croatia.\n\n3.
