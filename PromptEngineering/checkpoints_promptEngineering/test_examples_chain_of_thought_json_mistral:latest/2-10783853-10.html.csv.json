The relevant row index is 2.\n2. Identify the column name for the venue. In this case, it is 'venue'.\n3. Compare the value of the 'venue' column in the identified row with potential answers (in this case, only one answer: 'junction oval').\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row about St Kilda's match, locate the 'venue' column in that row, and compare its value to 'junction oval'.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to check the claim:\n\n1. Identify the target home team and away team mentioned in the claim: The home team is 'collingwood' and the away team is 'north melbourne'.\n2. Find the row in the table that matches the home team 'collingwood': The first row of the data array has 'collingwood' as the home team.\n3. Check if there is a corresponding row for the away team 'north melbourne': There isn't a corresponding row for 'north melborne' in the table, so we have to compare the remaining rows.\n4. Compare the scores of each remaining row with the score given for 'collingwood' (19.11 or 125): The second last row has a score for the home team that matches the score provided for 'collingwood', i.e., 19.11 (125).\n5. Identify the corresponding away team in this row: The away team in the second last row is 'essendon'.\n6. Confirm if the away team in this row is indeed 'north melbourne': No, the away team in this row is not 'north melbourne', so we have to compare the remaining row.\n7. Compare the scores of the final row with the score given for 'collingwood' (19.11 or 125): The score for the home team in the final row does not match the score provided for 'collingwood'.\n8. Since we have checked all rows and none of them match the target away team 'north melbourne' with the given score for 'collingwood', we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify home team and away team\",\n    \"Find row matching home team\",\n    \"Check if there's a corresponding row for away team\",\n    \"Compare scores of each remaining row with the score provided for 'collingwood'\",\n    \"Confirm the corresponding away team in matching rows\",\n    \"Check if the found away teams match the target away team\",\n    \"Since no match was found, conclude that the claim is false\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
