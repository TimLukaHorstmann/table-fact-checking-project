Check if there exists any row in the table that corresponds to the year 1901: The first element in the 'data' array is [1901, ...]. This means that the data for the year 1901 is present in the table.\n\n3. Verify if the details about the lead in the 54 holes are present in the row corresponding to 1901: The fourth element of the first row is \"(79 + 76 + 74 + 80 = 309)\". This means that there was a 5 shot lead (since the total score for 54 holes is 309 and the winning score is not mentioned explicitly but can be inferred to be 306, as it's common for par being 72 in golf, so the sum of four scores is 79 + 76 + 74 + 80 = 309 > 306 * 4).\n\n4. The final step is to confirm that the details match the claim: The claim stated \"have a 5 shot lead for 54 hole\".

Determine if the 54-hole score matches a 6 shot lead: To check if the 54-hole score represents a 6 shot lead, we need to first calculate the actual score (by adding up the four numbers in parentheses), and then compare it with a hypothetical score that is 6 shots better. In this case, the calculated score is 300, and a score 6 shots better would be 294 ((77 + 76 + 74 + 73) - 6).
