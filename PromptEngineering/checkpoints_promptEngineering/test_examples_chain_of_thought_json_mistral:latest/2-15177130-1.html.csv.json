However, there's no column for 'Vehicle' in the given data. Since the claim is specific to a particular vehicle type, we can assume that only races involving the BRM Type 15 will be counted.\n\n2. Check for the presence of the BRM Type 15 in each race: Iterate through each race (row) in the data and check if the driver of the race is associated with a BRM Type 15. If yes, then that race could potentially count towards the total number of races on the Albi circuit for the BRM Type 15.\n\n3. Check for races on the Albi circuit: Since the claim specifies a specific circuit (Albi), we need to filter out races that don't take place at Albi. This can be done by comparing the 'Race Location' (implicitly 'circuit') from each race with 'albi'.\n\n4. Count the number of qualifying heats and finals that meet the criteria: If a race meets both the BRM Type 15 criterion and the Albi circuit criterion, then it counts towards the total number of races on the Albi circuit for the BRM Type 15. In this dataset, there is no explicit column for 'qualifying heat' or 'final', so we will treat each race as a separate event, and if a driver participated in both the qualifying heat and the final, it would be counted twice.\n\n5. Determine the total number of races on the Albi circuit for the BRM Type 15: Sum up the number of events where a BRM Type 15 driver participated at the Albi circuit.\n\nNow let's check if there are any rows (events) that meet our criteria:\n\n- No row has an explicit 'Vehicle' column, so we can't confirm or deny that the BRM Type 15 took part in these races based on this information alone. However, since the claim specifies this vehicle type, and there are no other vehicles mentioned in the claim, we can assume that only events with a driver associated with the BRM Type 15 will count towards the total.\n\nBased on our analysis, it's impossible to definitively answer the question using the given information due to the lack of an explicit 'Vehicle' column. If such a column were available and confirmed the participation of the BRM Type 15 in certain events, then we could determine if the claim is true or false by counting those events that took place at Albi circuit.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the vehicle of interest (BRM Type 15)\",\n    \"Check for the presence of the BRM Type 15 in each race\",\n    \"Check for races on the Albi circuit\",\n    \"Count the number of qualifying heats and finals that meet the criteria\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"Indeterminate\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
