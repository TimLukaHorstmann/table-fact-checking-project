If there is a match in the 'locale' column, check if there are any other skips with the same locale: In our table, only one row has \"prince edward island\" as its value for 'locale', which indicates that there is no other skip in this province.

    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"skip jean - michel m\u00e9nard have a shot pct of 80% and 8 blank end\".\n\n2. Understand the table structure: We have a table with columns like \"locale\", \"skip\", \"w\", \"l\", \"pf\", \"pa\", \"ends won\", \"ends lost\", \"blank ends\", \"stolen ends\", and \"shot pct\". The \"skip\" column contains the names of the skips.\n\n3. Find the row corresponding to \"jean - michel m\u00e9nard\": To do this, we need to look for a row where the \"skip\" value matches \"jean - michel m\u00e9nard\". In our table, the row with index 3 corresponds to \"quebec\", which has \"jean - michel m\u00e9nard\" as its skip.\n\n4. Verify the values in the claim: After finding the relevant row, we should check if the values for \"shot pct\" and \"blank ends\" match those stated in the claim (80% and 8, respectively). In the given row, the value for \"shot pct\" is \"80%\" and there's no explicit value for \"blank ends\". However, we can calculate the total number of ends from the values of \"ends won\", \"ends lost\", and \"stolen ends\". The sum of these values (54 + 40 + 8) equals 102. Since each end has two blanks, the total number of blank ends is half of this sum, which is 102 / 2 = 51. So, the value for \"blank ends\" is not exactly 8 as stated in the claim, but it's close (51 - 8 = 43 difference).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Understand table structure\", \"Find row for 'jean - michel m\u00e9nard'\", \"Verify values in the claim\", \"Calculate total number of blank ends\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"shot pct\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"blank ends\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Our claim is that \"67 be the pf when end lost be 40\".
