To verify this, we need to find out if there are any records of loan returns for players labeled as \"Esp\" (Spanish) in the table and whether those loans occurred during the seasons between 2008 and 2009.\n2. Find all player records where the \"type\" is either \"loan return\" or \"loan\". This will give us a list of potential players who had loan transactions during the relevant period.\n3. Filter this list to only include players labeled as \"Esp\". This will help us focus on Spanish players, as per the claim.\n4. Analyze the filtered list to find out if there are any loan returns for the players labeled as \"Garc\u00eda\" or \"Agus\". If we find a match during the 2008-09 season, it would support the claim. If we don't find any matches or only find loans (not loan returns) for these players, it would suggest that the claim is false.\n5. Examine each relevant cell to see if they provide evidence in favor of or against the claim.
