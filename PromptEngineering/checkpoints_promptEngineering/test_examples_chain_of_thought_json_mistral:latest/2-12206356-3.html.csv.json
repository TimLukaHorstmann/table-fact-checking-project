    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify the required data from the table: The date, opponent, record (win-loss), pitcher (loss), and opponent's name should match the given date (\"june 9\"), opponent (\"yankees\"), loss pitcher (\"mulholland\"), and overall win-loss record that is close to 28 - 29.\n\n2. Iterate through each row in the table starting from the first row (index 0) until we find a match for the given date and opponent. Note the index of this row since it will contain the required data.\n\n3. After finding the matching row, compare the loss pitcher's record with \"mulholland (5 - 6)\" and the overall win-loss record with a value close to 28 - 29.\n\n4. If both conditions are met, return the final answer as TRUE along with relevant cells that validate the claim.\n\nRelevant cells for this claim:\n- { \"row_index\": <matching row index>, \"column_name\": \"win\" } (to confirm the win-loss record is close to 28 - 29)\n- { \"row_index\": <matching row index>, \"column_name\": \"loss\" } (to confirm the loss pitcher's record matches \"mulholland (5 - 6)\" )\n- { \"row_index\": <matching row index>, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" } (to confirm the opponent is the yankees)\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the required data from the table\",\n    \"Iterate through each row and find a match for the given date, opponent, and pitcher\",\n    \"Compare the loss pitcher's record with 'mulholland (5 - 6)' and the overall win-loss record with a value close to 28 - 29\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"win\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"loss\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n  ]\n}",
