Examine the 'outcome' column for these rows: In row 1, the outcome is \"runner - up\", while in row 4, the outcome is \"winner\".\n\n5. Compare with the claim: The 'zurich' match in row 1 is a runner-up, which matches the claim. However, the 'zurich' match in row 4 is not a runner-up, and thus does not match the claim.

Check both names separately as they may appear in different order or split across two cells (e.g., \"Peng Shuai\" and \"Hsieh Su - Wei\").\n5.
