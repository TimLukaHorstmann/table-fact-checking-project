Find the relevant data for William the Adeling in the table:\n   - First, identify the row index of William the Adeling's data. From the table, we can see that his data is in the 5th row (index 4).\n   - Next, find out the columns related to \"became heir\", \"ceased to be heir\", and \"monarch\" as these columns are relevant for our claim. In this case, the column names are \"became heir\", \"reason\", \"ceased to be heir\".\n\n3. Extract the values of those columns:\n   - For the row index 4 (William the Adeling's data), the \"became heir\" value is \"1103\", and the \"reason\" value is \"born\". However, there is no \"ceased to be heir\" value in his data.\n\n4. Check if the given date (5 August 1119) matches with the found \"ceased to be heir\" date: Since there's no ceased-to-be-heir date provided for William the Adeling, we cannot compare it with the given date of 5 August 1119.\n\n5. Find the relevant data for Empress Matilda in the table:\n   - Identify the row index of Empress Matilda's data.

In this case, the column names are \"ceased to be heir\".\n\n6. Extract the values of that column:\n   - For the row index 6 (Empress Matilda's data), the \"ceased to be heir\" value is given as \"1 december 1135 (22 december 1135)\".\n\n7. Check if the time gap between the ceasing of William the Adeling and Empress Matilda is 21 years:\n   - Subtract the ceased-to-be-heir date of William the Adeling from the ceased-to-be-heir date of Empress Matilda. The result is (1 December 1135 - 25 November 1120) + 1 (for considering the year change between the dates).
