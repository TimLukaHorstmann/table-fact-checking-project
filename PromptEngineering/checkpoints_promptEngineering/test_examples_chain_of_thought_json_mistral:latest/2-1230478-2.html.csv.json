Unfortunately, we don't have direct information about the artist in the table, so we can't directly search for her entries. However, we can infer that \"move closer\" and \"move closer (re-issue)\" could possibly be the same song by the same artist as they share the same album title.\n\n2. Search for instances where the \"album\" column matches with either \"move closer\" or \"move closer (re-issue)\". This will give us potential entries of Phyllis Nelson in the table.\n\n3. Once we have the rows that match, check if any of these rows have a non-empty value in the \"us hot 100\" column. If a row has a non-empty value (indicating chart position), it means that the artist entered the US Hot 100 at least once.\n\n4. Check if there are multiple such rows, as the claim states that Phyllis Nelson made it to the US Hot 100 twice.\n\n5. If more than one row matches and each has a non-empty value in the \"us hot 100\" column, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBased on the table provided:\n\n- The rows that match with either \"move closer\" or \"move closer (re-issue)\" are at indices 0 and 4.\n- Row 0 has an empty value in the \"us hot 100\" column, so Phyllis Nelson didn't make it to the US Hot 100 the first time.\n- Row 4 has an empty value in the \"us hot 100\" column as well, so Phyllis Nelson didn't make it to the US Hot 100 the second time either.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find all rows where the album matches with 'move closer' or 'move closer (re-issue)',\",\n    \"Identify potential entries of Phyllis Nelson in the table.\",\n    \"Check if any matched rows have a non-empty value in the 'us hot 100' column.\",\n    \"Verify that there are two such rows with non-empty values.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
