The home team is listed in the first column of the selected row (column_name: \"home team\").\n3. Compare the identified home team with \"south melbourne\". If they match, proceed to check the score.\n4. Check the score for the selected game. The home team score is listed in the second column of the selected row (column_name: \"home team score\").\n5.
