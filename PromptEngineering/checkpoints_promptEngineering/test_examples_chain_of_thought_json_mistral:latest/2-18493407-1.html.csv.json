For each show, find its corresponding row in the table's data array. The row index for \"a tough side of a lady\" is 0, and for \"simply ordinary\", it is 7.\n3. Examine the genre column of both rows to determine if they are costume dramas or not. For \"a tough side of a lady\", the genre is \"costume action\". Since the claim asks for costume drama specifically, we need to find another way to verify this show. However, since it's labeled as a \"costume\" genre in the table, it can be assumed that it falls under the category of costume drama implicitly due to naming conventions. For \"simply ordinary\", the genre is \"costume drama\".\n4. Compare the genres of both shows. If they are the same, the claim is true.\n\nIn this case, since both shows are labeled as costumes in the table, and one of them has an additional label of action which we can infer is related to costume in a broader sense, they share the genre of costume drama.
