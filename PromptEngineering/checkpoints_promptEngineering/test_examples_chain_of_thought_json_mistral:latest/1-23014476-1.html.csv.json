Iterate through each row in the data array, and calculate the margin for that county using the formula: `Gore_% - Bush_%`. Store this value in the `margin` variable for that iteration.\n3. Initialize a variable `narrowest_margin` to store the smallest margin found so far. Set it to a very large number (e.g., 99999).\n4. Initialize a variable `county_with_narrowest_margin` to store the county with the narrowest margin. Set it to an empty string.\n5. In the iteration where you calculate the margin for each county, compare the current margin (`margin`) with the `narrowest_margin`. If the current margin is smaller than the `narrowest_margin`, update both the `narrowest_margin` and `county_with_narrowest_margin` variables.\n6. After iterating through all the rows, check if the `county_with_narrowest_margin` variable still contains an empty string. If it does, that means no county has a smaller margin than the largest value you initially set (99999), and therefore, there is no narrowest margin between Gore and Bush. Otherwise, proceed to step 7.\n7. Check if the `county_with_narrowest_margin` variable contains the name of the first row (\"clark\"). If it does, then \"Clark County\" has the narrowest margin between Gore and Bush during the 2000 presidential election.
