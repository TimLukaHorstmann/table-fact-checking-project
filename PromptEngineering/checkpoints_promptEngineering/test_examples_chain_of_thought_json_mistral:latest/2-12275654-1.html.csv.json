Check each row in the table to see if both players (in this case, Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan) appear together in the same row of the women's singles column.

Examine each row for Katrin Schmidt to find out how many times she appeared in the women's singles column. Count the rows where Pi Hongyan is also present in the same row. If both players appear together more than once, it means they have both played twice or more in women's singles.\n\n4.
