    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for checking the claim:\n\n1. Identify the relevant data based on the claim conditions, which are the rank (1) and total medal count (more than 21). The table has a column named \"rank\" and a calculated column named \"total\".\n\n2. Check if there is any row where the \"rank\" matches with 1 and the \"total\" is more than 21. In this case, none of the rows meet these conditions because the maximum total for rank 1 is 22, which is not more than 21.\n\n3. However, since the claim also specifies that the gold medal count must be 13 for any row where the total is more than 21, we don't need to check this condition because no row meets the first condition (total > 21).\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant data: total medal count (more than 21) and gold medal count (13) for rank 1.\",\n    \"Check if there exists any row where 'rank' equals 1 and 'total' is more than 21.\",\n    \"In this table, no such row is present.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
