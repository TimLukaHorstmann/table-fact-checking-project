Check the first few rows to get an idea of whether most games have been held in Baltimore: Rows 2-18 provide information about past seasons, but only rows 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18 have specified locations (Baltimore for all except row 12).

Check the remaining years with known locations: Rows 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 do not show a location, so we cannot confirm if they will be held in Baltimore.
