The relevant cells for this comparison are rows with indexes other than 0 and columns with names \"qual 1\" and \"qual 2\".\n\n3. Sort the drivers based on their scores in the second qualifier, from best to worst (higher values mean better performance). Ignore the driver we're comparing (Justin Wilson) for this sorting step.\n\n4. Find the driver with the best score in the second qualifier after sorting and determine that driver's row index. This is the driver who has the first position in the second qualifier. The relevant cells for this comparison are rows with indexes other than 0 and columns with name \"qual 2\".\n\n5.

Compare the row index of the driver with the second-best score in the second qualifier (obtained in step 5) to the row index of Justin Wilson (obtained in step 1). If they are equal, it means Justin Wilson has the second-best score and we can conclude that his score is not better than the one obtained during the second qualifier.\n\n7.

Compare the best times of the rookies and find out the order: After comparing the best times of the identified rookie drivers, we can see which one has the fastest time and which ones follow in the ranking.\n\n5. Validate the claim: If Neel Jani's best time is faster than Simon Pagenaud's but slower than another rookie driver's best time, then the claim is false. However, if Neel Jani's best time is either equal to or faster than Simon Pagenaud's and slower than another rookie driver's best time, then the claim is true.\n\nThe final answer will be based on the comparison of the best times of Neel Jani and Simon Pagenaud:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the rookies by looking for drivers with '(r)' in their name\",\n    \"Find the 'best' column to compare the fastest lap times\",\n    \"Compare the best times of Neel Jani and Simon Pagenaud\",\n    \"Determine if Neel Jani is second to Simon Pagenaud\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"best\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"best\" }\n  ]\n}",
