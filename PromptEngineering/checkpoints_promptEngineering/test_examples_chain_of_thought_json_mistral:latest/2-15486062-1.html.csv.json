Next, parse the result strings in the \"result\" column to extract the point scores. However, since the scores are presented in a win-loss format (e.g., \"w 9 - 7\"), we'll need to find a way to separate the two numbers representing the scores of each team.\n3. Since the number of wins and losses for each game is always one digit and followed by a space, we can split the strings using the space character as a delimiter to extract the two numbers. The first number corresponds to the opponent's score, and the second number corresponds to our team's score.\n4. Now that we have the scores, compare each team's score against the claim of \"the most point score by any team in a single game be 36\".\n5.
