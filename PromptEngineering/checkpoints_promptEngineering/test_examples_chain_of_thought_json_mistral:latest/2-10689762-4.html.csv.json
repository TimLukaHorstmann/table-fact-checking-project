In the table, we see that it's listed as 'Long Beach State' (note the space).\n2. Check the region for this university. To do this, iterate through the data and find the row where the 'host' column matches 'long beach state'.\n3. In the current row (let's say index 27), check the 'region' column to see if it corresponds to 'midwest'.\n4. If step 3 returns 'midwest', then proceed to step 5; otherwise, conclude that the claim is FALSE and provide the relevant cells.\n5. Check if the venue in the current row (index 27) matches with 'university gym (gold mine)'.\n6. If step 5 returns a match, then conclude that the claim is TRUE and provide the relevant cells.\n\nNow, let's see how these steps apply to the data:\n\n1.
