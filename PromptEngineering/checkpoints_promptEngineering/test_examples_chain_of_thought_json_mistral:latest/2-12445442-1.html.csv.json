In this case, we have name, entered office, left office, party, first minister, which can also be used as references to other columns when needed.\n   2. Locate the row that contains Fergus Ewing's data by matching his name with the 'name' column in the 'data' array. In this case, it is located at the 8th row.\n   3. Check the value of the 4th column (party) for Fergus Ewing to determine his political affiliation. The value is \"scottish national party\".\n   4. Since Fergus Ewing is a member of the Scottish National Party, we can now check if there's any row where both the 'party' and 'minister for community safety and legal affairs' columns match his party and minister role respectively.\n   5. To do that, we need to filter the 'data' array based on Fergus Ewing's party (3rd step) and the specific minister role ('minister for community safety and legal affairs'). We will then check if any of the filtered rows also match Fergus Ewing's entered office date.\n   6. After filtering, we can see that there is only one row where both conditions are met: the 10th row (8th row index - 2 because of step 4 skips the header row).
