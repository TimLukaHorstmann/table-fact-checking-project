Search for a row where the \"march\" column matches the date corresponding to the index of the given claim (in this case, 28). Note that since the data is sorted by date, the first row corresponds to March 1 and the last row corresponds to March 31.\n3.

Scan through the rows of the table to find the row where the value in the 'march' column matches the target date (in this case, March 24).\n3. If no such row is found, then the opponent on March 24 is not present in the table, and the answer would be FALSE.\n4. However, if a row with the specified date is found, then the opponent on that date would be the value in the 'opponent' column of that row. In this case, the target opponent should be in the row where the 'march' value is 24 (as March has 31 days, the last row could potentially be the correct one).\n5. After finding the relevant row, check if the value in the 'opponent' column matches the claim ('colorado rockies'). If it does, then the answer would be TRUE.\n\nNow let's find out whether the opponent on March 24 is the Colorado Rockies:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date column\",\n    \"Scan through the rows to find the row with the specified date (March 24)\",\n    \"Check if the value in the 'opponent' column matches the claim ('colorado rockies')\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
