Iterate through the rows of the table (data array) to find episodes directed by David Moore.\n3. Check if the value in the \"directed by\" column matches with David Moore for any row.\n4. If there are one or more rows where the \"directed by\" column has a value of David Moore, then it means that he directed at least one episode.\n5. To check if he directed episodes from series 2, we also need to know the series number for each episode. Unfortunately, the table does not provide this information. However, if we assume (for the sake of argument) that series 1 is represented by a \"no overall\" column value of 1 and increases by 1 for each subsequent series, then we can check if there are any episodes where David Moore directed and the \"no overall\" column value is greater than or equal to 2.\n6. If there are one or more rows where the \"directed by\" column has a value of David Moore and the \"no overall\" column value is greater than or equal to 2, then it means that he directed at least one episode from series 2.\n7.
