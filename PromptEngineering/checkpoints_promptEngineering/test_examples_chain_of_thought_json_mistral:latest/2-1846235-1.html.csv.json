Identify the source of information in the table as it does not specify the event type (swimming) or the year (1952 Summer Olympics). However, we can use other indicators from the table to infer some information.\n\n2. Check for relevant data columns: The table has a \"nation\" column which gives us nation names but lacks columns explicitly indicating gender (men/women) and event type (swimming).\n\n3. Assume that each row represents a country's total medals count in all events, including swimming. If this assumption is correct, we can infer the number of participating nations (12) and events (since there are 12 total medals for 12 countries).\n\n4. Count the total medals per event: Since each medal represents an event won by a country, we sum up all the total medals to find the total number of events contested in these Olympics. The total is 36 (sum of all \"total\" values in data array). However, we cannot determine if they are distributed between men and women as there's no such information provided.\n\n5. Check for consistency: An Olympic event typically consists of multiple medals (gold, silver, bronze), so having only one medal per country is unlikely for all events. In our case, it seems unusual that a single country like the United States has won 9 out of the total 36 medals if each country participated in just one event.\n\n6.
