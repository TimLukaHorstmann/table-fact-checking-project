Identify the claim: The claim states that there exists a row where the 2nd (m) point value is 135.0, and the overall points (sum of 1st (m) and 2nd (m)) is 246.6.\n\n2. Extract the relevant columns from the table: \"1st (m)\", \"2nd (m)\" and \"overall wc points (rank)\". This will help us to verify if the claim is true or false.\n\n3. Check each row in the table against the given condition. For each row, calculate the sum of \"1st (m)\" and \"2nd (m)\", and compare it with 246.6. If the calculated value matches 246.6, then check if the \"2nd (m)\" value is equal to 135.0 for that row.\n\n4. Since we have a table with sorted rows by overall points in descending order, we start from the last row and move upwards until finding a match or verifying that no such match exists.\n\n5. Based on the data provided, if we find a row where both conditions (1st (m) + 2nd (m) = 246.6 and 2nd (m) = 135.0) are met, then the claim is true.

Compare the values found in steps 2 with the claim's conditions:\n       - For '1st (m)', the given value (130.0) is greater than the specified threshold (124.5).
