Identify the claim's key components: The claim states that Austria ranks highest due to the number of medals and was the only country to win a bronze medal in the 1961 World Luge Championship.\n\n2. Find out the ranking of each country based on their total medals (gold + silver + bronze): To determine this, we look for the \"total\" column in the data array. The higher the value, the higher the ranking.\n\n3. Check if Austria has the highest total: In row 1, Austria's total is 3 (0 gold, 0 silver, and 3 bronze). We compare this with the other countries. If Austria has the highest total, it will be ranked first.\n\n4. Verify if Austria was the only country to win a bronze medal in the championship: To check this, we look for other rows where the \"bronze\" column is greater than zero (indicating another country won a bronze). If we find no such row, then Austria indeed was the only one with a bronze.\n\n5.
