Check the partner's names in those specific rows.\n    - In row 0, the partner is Martina Navratilova.\n    - In row 1, the partner is Marija Vento-Kabchi Angelique Widjaja (combined). However, we need to find out if one of these players was partnering with Martina Navratilova in either of these tournaments.\n\n3. For each opponent pair, check if either player is Martina Navratilova.\n    - In row 0, the opponents are Jelena Dokic and Nadia Petrova. Neither of them is Martina Navratilova, so let's check the other members in their respective teams.\n        - Jelena Dokic was not partnered with Navratilova in this tournament (row 0).\n        - In row 1, one opponent is Petrova who was a partner of Navratilova in Toronto 2003 (we don't have to check the other opponent since we found a match).\n\n4. The claim asks for both championships in Rome and Toronto in 2003, so we should also verify if Martina Navratilova was the partner during the Rome tournament.\n    - Since there is only one partner per row, and the partner in row 0 is Martina Navratilova, she was the partner for the championship in Rome (in 2003).\n\n5. Based on our findings:\n   - In the Rome 2003 tournament, Martina Navratilova had Petrova as her partner.\n   - In the Toronto 2003 tournament, Martina Navratilova had one of her opponents (Petrova) as her partner.\n\n6.
