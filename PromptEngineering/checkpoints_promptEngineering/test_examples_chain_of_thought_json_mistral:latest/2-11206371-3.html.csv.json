To determine if \"paddock's last appearance be in 'blood is thicker than water'\" is true, we need to find out when paddock appeared for the last time and check if it was in an episode titled \"Blood is Thicker than Water\".\n2. Similarly, to determine if \"red squirrel's last appearance be in 'a hero's welcome'\" is true, we need to find out when red squirrel appeared for the last time and check if it was in an episode titled \"A Hero's Welcome\".\n3.
