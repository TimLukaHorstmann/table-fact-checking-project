First, I identified the claim's specific details: the team (Washington Redskins) and the result of the game (L 30 - 27).\n2. Next, I noted that the date provided in the claim matches one of the dates in the table.\n3. Then, I searched for a row in the table where the \"opponent\" column has the value \"washington redskins\" and the \"result\" column has the value containing both \"l\" and the number 30, but with a difference of at least 7 in the other number (since scores are always displayed as team1 - team2).\n4. After finding such a row, I verified that the date in this row matches the date provided in the claim.\n5. Finally, if a matching row was found and its date matched the date in the claim, then the claim would be considered true; otherwise, false.\n\nWith the given table, the relevant cells are:\n- { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" } (Washington Redskins)\n- { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\" } (L 30 - 27)\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim details\", \"Search for a row with matching opponent and result values\", \"Verify that the date matches the date in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }, { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\" } ]\n}",

Next, find the attendance for this specific game. This information can be found in the fifth column of the same row (column_name=\"attendance\"). The value is 42172.\n\n3. Compare the attendance of all games to see if it's the highest one. By looking through the table, we observe that there are no other games with a higher attendance (42172) in this dataset.\n\n4.
