    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the table structure, including columns and data.\n2. Determine the claim components: win percentage (90%) and promotion in 2007.\n3. Find the row that corresponds to 2007 from the 'data' array. In this case, it would be the 5th row (since indexing starts at 0).\n4. Check if the number of wins for the team in 2007 can provide a win percentage of 90% or closer. To calculate the win percentage, divide the number of wins by the total number of games (wins + losses + ties), which is (6+1+0)/(6+4+0)=0.6 or 60%. This is not close to 90%, so the claim about the win percentage is FALSE.\n5. Check if the team in 2007 was promoted. The final position and notes columns can provide insight into this. In this case, the final position column indicates a position of \"1 / 6\", which may suggest the team finished first in their division but does not confirm promotion to a higher division. However, the notes column for that year (\"promoted to division 1 north\") confirms that they were indeed promoted. So, while the final position may not be conclusive, the notes indicate that the team was promoted in 2007, making the claim about promotion TRUE.\n6.

This indicates that these teams are most likely the Dundee Hurricane as their positions seem to be in order.\n\n2. For each row, check if the number of losses is greater than the number of wins, as this would define a losing season.\n\n3. Analyze the rows where the \"final position\" column starts with \"2 /\". These are:\n   - Row 1 (2003): 4 losses, which is less than 6 wins, so it's not a losing season.\n   - Row 2 (2004): 2 losses, which is less than 6 wins, so it's not a losing season.\n   - Row 5 (2007): 1 loss, which is less than 9 wins, so it's not a losing season.\n   - Row 8 (2009): 6 losses, which is greater than 2 wins, so it's a losing season.\n\n4. Finally, verify if there are any other rows that also have 6 losses and match the \"Dundee Hurricane\" pattern:\n   - Row 3 (2005): 5 losses, not matching the pattern of 6 losses.\n   - Row 6 (2006): 4 losses, which is greater than 3 wins, so it's a losing season.
