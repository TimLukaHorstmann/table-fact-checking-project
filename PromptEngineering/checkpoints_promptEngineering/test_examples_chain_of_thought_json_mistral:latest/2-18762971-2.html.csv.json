Organize the data: The data is presented in a table-like format. We need to convert this into a more manageable format for easier comparison. I will create two separate arrays of objects, one for each match date, with the attendance value as the only property.\n\n```javascript\nconst march7thMatch = [\n  { name: 'attendance' }\n].concat(data[0]['2001-03-07'].slice(1));\n\nconst february21stMatch = [\n  { name: 'attendance' }\n].concat(data[0]['2001-02-21'].slice(1));\n```\n\n3. Compare the attendance values: Now that we have organized the data for both matches, we can compare their attendance values.\n\n```javascript\nconst march7thAttendance = parseInt(march7thMatch[0]['attendance']); // 20503\nconst february21stAttendance = parseInt(february21stMatch[0]['attendance']); // 23266\n```\n\n4.
