Extract the relevant column from the table: In this case, the relevant column is 'bore'.\n\n3. Compare the value of the 'bore' for the row with the name \"9 adr\" to all other rows' 'bore' values: To do this, we need to iterate through each row in the data and compare the 'bore' value of \"9 adr\" to the 'bore' value of the current row.\n\n4. Determine if the comparison holds true for all rows: If the bore value of \"9 adr\" is equal to the bore value of every other row, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n   Here is the final output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the given claim\",\n    \"Extract the relevant column from the table (in this case, 'bore')\",\n    \"Compare the value of the 'bore' for the row with the name '9 adr' to all other rows' 'bore' values\",\n    \"Determine if the comparison holds true for all rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"bore\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"bore\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"bore\"\n    },\n    // ...
