    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the total number of rows in the table. This will help determine the proportion of MPs who were lieutenants.\n2. Count the number of rows where the value under the \"rank in military\" column is \"lieutenant\". This will give us the count of MPs who were lieutenants.\n3. Divide the number of MPs who were lieutenants by the total number of MPs to get a proportion. If this proportion is greater than 50%, then most of the MPs were lieutenants.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n1. The table has 29 rows (indexed from 0 to 28).\n2. There are 14 rows where the value under the \"rank in military\" column is \"lieutenant\".\n3. Proportion of MPs who were lieutenants = Number of MPs who were lieutenants / Total number of MPs = 14/29 \u2248 0.48275862069 (approximately 48.28%)\n\nSince the proportion is less than 50%, most of the MPs were not lieutenant.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the total number of rows, count the number of rows where rank is lieutenant, calculate the proportion of MPs who were lieutenants and compare it to 50%.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\" }\n  ]\n}",
