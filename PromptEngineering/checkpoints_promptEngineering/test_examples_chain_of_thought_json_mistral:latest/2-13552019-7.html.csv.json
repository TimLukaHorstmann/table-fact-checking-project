If there are no such gaps for any team, then the claim can be confirmed as TRUE. Otherwise, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBased on my analysis of the table, here's the relevant data:\n\n1.

The time period covered is from September 1st to September 30th (excluding September 14th and 15th).\n\nNow let's analyze each team's games to check if there are at least two games per week:\n\n- Braves: Games on Sep 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 23, 25, and 26. There is a gap of five days between games on September 10th and 17th. So the Braves do not play at least two times per week every week.\n- Mets: Games on Sep 18, 19, 20, and 21. There is a gap of six days between games on September 19th and 21st. So the Mets also do not play at least two times per week every week.\n- Phillies: Games on Sep 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 27. There is a gap of four days between games on September 23rd and 27th. So the Phillies do not play at least two times per week every week.\n- Cardinals: Games on Sep 29 and 30. There is no data for September 16th, but there are gaps of more than six days between games for other weeks. For example, a gap of nine days between games on September 3rd and 12th, and a gap of seven days between games on September 2nd and 9th. So the Cardinals do not play at least two times per week every week.\n- Expos: Games on Sep 25, 26, 27, and 29. There is no data for September 16th, but there are gaps of more than six days between games for other weeks. For example, a gap of nine days between games on September 3rd and 12th, and a gap of seven days between games on September 2nd and 9th.
