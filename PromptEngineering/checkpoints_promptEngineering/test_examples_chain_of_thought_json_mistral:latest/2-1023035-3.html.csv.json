To check this, compare the 'most recent cap' and 'first cap' dates to find out how many years he played for the team. Since the 'first cap' is in 1992 and 'most recent cap' is in 2006, we can see that Vaughan Coveny played for 15 years.\n\n3. Check if there are any caps during his second and third year. To do this, we need to find out the specific years of caps for Vaughan Coveny. In our table, each row represents a year. Therefore, we want to identify rows where the 'name' is Vaughan Coveny and the row indexes are between 2 (second year) and 3 (third year).\n\n4.

In our table, all the rows after the first one belong to Vaughan Coveny and represent his subsequent years with the team.
