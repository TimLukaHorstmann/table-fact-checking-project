In the table, we have 'ends' (for Bennie Oosterbaan & Mike Tully) and 'tackles' (for Ed Weir & Ralph Chase).\n2. Verify if any of the players mentioned in the table play both positions. However, since each player only appears once with a specific position, it means they do not play multiple positions.\n3. Identify the players that play the same position as those mentioned in the claim. For 'ends', we find Bennie Oosterbaan & Mike Tully. For 'tackles', we find Ed Weir & Ralph Chase.\n4. Check if these players play the same position (i.e., ends or tackles). Since they belong to different rows, they do not play the same position within the table.\n5.
