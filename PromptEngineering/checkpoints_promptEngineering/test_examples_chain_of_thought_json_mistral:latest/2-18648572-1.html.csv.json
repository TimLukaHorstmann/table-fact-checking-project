Compare the number of wins with 5 to see if any team had at least 5 victories during the season.\n4. If a team has 5 or more wins, the claim \"the san francisco 49ers win 5 game during the 1973 season\" is FALSE because it is incorrectly stating that the San Francisco 49ers won games, but they are not present in the table.
