Identify the team in question, which appears to be the Vancouver Grizzlies (rows 0-9) until they change their name to Memphis Grizzlies starting from row 10.\n2. Determine the division of each season for the Vancouver Grizzlies. From rows 1 to 9, the division is consistently listed as \"midwest\".\n3. Check if there's a change in the division after the team changes its name to Memphis Grizzlies (row 10). The division remains unchanged and is still listed as \"memphis grizzlies\" for all rows, so it does not indicate a division change.\n4. Look for any sign of a division change within the same table after the \"Vancouver Grizzlies\" part ends (row 10). In this case, we see that the division changes from \"memphis grizzlies\" to \"southwest\" starting at row 11.\n5. Compare the seasons of these two divisions to find out when the change occurred. The season for the first occurrence of \"southwest\" is \"2004 - 05\".\n6.
