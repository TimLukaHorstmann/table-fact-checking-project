If the highest total comes from a specific country (in this case, the country name is in the 'country' column), then the claim is either true or false depending on whether that total matches 282.\n\nNow, let's check the data:\n1. There are two rows with 't12' in the 'finish' column (3rd and 6th rows).\n2. Compare their 'total' values: Tiger Woods has a total of 282 and Ernie Els has a total of 279.\n3. The highest total is 282, which belongs to Tiger Woods.\n4. However, Tiger Woods is from the United States, not South Africa.\n5.
