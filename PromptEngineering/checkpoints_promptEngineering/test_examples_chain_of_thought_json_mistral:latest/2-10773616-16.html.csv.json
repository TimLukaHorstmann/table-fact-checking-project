Compare the home team scores for Collingwood and Carlton: Collingwood's score is \"12.16 (88)\", while Carlton's score is \"10.16 (76)\". To compare these values, we first need to extract the numbers from the brackets. The number in brackets represents the points scored, and they are equal to 88 for Collingwood and 76 for Carlton.\n5. Compare the point scores: Collingwood's score is 88, while Carlton's score is 76.
