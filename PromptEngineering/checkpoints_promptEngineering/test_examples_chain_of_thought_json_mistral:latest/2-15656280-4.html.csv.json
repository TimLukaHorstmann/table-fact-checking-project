    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the claim:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns for this question, which are \"play - offs\" and \"fa cup\". These will be used to filter the data.\n2. Iterate through each row of the data array, checking if the value in the \"play - offs\" column is 2 (which represents a player who scored 2 goals in the play-offs) and if the value in the \"fa cup\" column is 1 (which represents a player who scored 1 goal in the FA Cup).\n3. If a row meets these conditions, find the total number of goals that player has scored by summing the values in the \"total\" column for that row. This number will be compared to the claimed value of 3.0.\n4. Check if there exists any such player who scored 2 in play-offs and 1 in fa cup and has a total of 3 goals. If such a player is found, the claim is false. If no such player is found, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns\",\n    \"Iterate through each row and check conditions on play-offs and fa cup columns\",\n    \"Find total goals for players meeting conditions using the 'total' column\",\n    \"Compare total goals with the claimed value of 3.0\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
