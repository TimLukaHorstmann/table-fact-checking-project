In this case, the relevant columns are \"week\", \"theme\", \"song choice\", \"original artist\". The column \"order\" might be useful for comparing the position of two songs, but it is not directly related to the song choices themselves.\n\n2. Scan through the rows looking for a match in the \"song choice\" column for \"angel\". This should help us identify the row that represents the performance of \"angel\".\n\n3. Once we have found the row corresponding to \"angel\", look for another match in the \"song choice\" column for the song named \"lean on me\". If there is a match, it means that didi benami sang \"lean on me\" after \"angel\".\n\n4. After searching through the rows, if we find no match for \"lean on me\" coming after \"angel\", then the claim is false.\n\nThe final answer will be in the following JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist\",\n    \"Scan through rows looking for 'angel' in the song choice column\",\n    \"Find the row that corresponds to 'angel'\",\n    \"Look for another match for 'lean on me' coming after 'angel'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song choice\" }\n  ]\n}",

Since \"no one\" is not present in the table, we can conclude that there's no direct evidence of \"no one\" being Didi Benami's song choice.\n3.

Find all rows related to Didi Benami: To do this, check each row in the table and compare the \"original artist\" column with Didi Benami's song(s). Since we don't have information about Didi Benami's performance during the audition or Hollywood round, we will only focus on rows where the \"theme\" is not 'audition' or 'Hollywood'.\n3. Check if the positions (order) in both top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women) are the same: To do this, compare the \"order\" column of each relevant row with Didi Benami's position(s). If they match, it means that she was number 5 in both rounds.\n\nNow let's find relevant cells for our reasoning:\n- Row index 6: theme='top 24 (12 women)', original artist='ingrid michaelson', order='9'. This row is not relevant since we are not looking for performances before the top 20.\n- Row index 7: theme='top 20 (10 women)', original artist='bill withers', order='5'. This row is potentially relevant because it meets two conditions: the \"theme\" is 'top 20' and the \"order\" is '5'.\n- Row index 8: theme='top 16 (8 women)', original artist='fleetwood mac', order='5'. This row is potentially relevant because it meets the two conditions we have set: the \"theme\" is 'top 16' and the \"order\" is '5'.\n\nSince both potential relevant rows share the same \"order\", our final answer will be based on whether Didi Benami performed these songs in top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women).\n\nNow, let's provide the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify contestant: Didi Benami\",\n    \"Find rows related to Didi Benami\",\n    \"Check if positions in both top 20 and top 16 are the same\",\n    \"Potentially relevant cells: row index 7 (top 20) & row index 8 (top 16)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original artist\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original artist\" }\n  ]\n}",
