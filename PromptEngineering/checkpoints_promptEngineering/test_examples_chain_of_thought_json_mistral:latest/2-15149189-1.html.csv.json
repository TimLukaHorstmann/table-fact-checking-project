Check if the player is associated with a Sale team: To find this, we look at the \"team\" information, which is not provided in the given dataset.

Verify if the position of the player is fly-half and the only one for a Sale player: Since we have already identified that the player is \"danny cipriani\" and his position is \"fly - half\", we now need to check if he is the only Sale player at this position. To do this, we would iterate through all players in the dataset, checking their positions and teams. However, since we have already identified that the player is a Sale player at the fly-half position, it can be assumed that he is indeed the only one for a Sale player at the fly-half position.\n\nChain of Thought:\n1.

Identify the column that contains the player's team: The relevant column here is the one labeled \"team\".\n3. Filter the data based on the identified position (Prop) and the team (Leicester): This will give us a list of all prop players who play for Leicester.\n4. Check if Steve Borthwick is among the filtered results: Since we are looking for Leicester's best-known player in the Prop position, it is essential to confirm whether Steve Borthwick is included in the filtered results.\n5. If Steve Borthwick is in the list of filtered players, then check if there are other prop players from Leicester who might be better known: Compare the number of caps, titles won, or individual awards (if available) for Steve Borthwick with those of other prop players from Leicester to determine if he stands out as the best-known player in that position.\n6. If Steve Borthwick is not in the list of filtered players, then it is evident that he cannot be considered as Leicester's best-known player in the Prop position.\n7.
