To do this, look at the \"date\" column and filter out the games that are in November (note that \"november 2\" is actually the 2nd of November).\n3. For each game found in step 2, check the value in the \"location attendance\" column to see if it's less than 14000. If all these values are less than 14000, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the relevant column for attendance (location attendance), filter data for November games, and check if each game's attendance is less than 14000\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
