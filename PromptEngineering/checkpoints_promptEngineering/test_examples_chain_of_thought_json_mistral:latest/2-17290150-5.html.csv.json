Find that there are four players (Harvie Ward and Tommy Bolt, tied at 144, and Julius Boros, Jack Fleck, and Ben Hogan, tied at 145) with scores less than or equal to 147. However, none of them have a score of 144 - 3.\n8. Since there is no player with the exact score mentioned in the claim (144 - 3), we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure and understand it represents golf tournament results\",\n    \"Find 'score' column to get players' scores\",\n    \"Convert score strings into integers\",\n    \"Check for a player with a score less than or equal to 144 - 3\",\n    \"No player found with that exact score, check for players close to it\",\n    \"Find four players with scores less than or equal to 147 but none at 144 - 3\",\n    \"Conclude the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
