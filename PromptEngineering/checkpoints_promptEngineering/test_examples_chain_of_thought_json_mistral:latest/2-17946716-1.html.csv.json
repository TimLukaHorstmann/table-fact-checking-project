Determine the week number corresponding to each date (since weeks start from 1). The table does not provide a direct way to do this, but we can infer it based on the order of the dates in the \"data\" array.\n       - The first three rows correspond to weeks 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, any row with a date after September 30, 1960 (the date in the third row) will be in week 4 or later.\n   3. Compare the given date (October 9, 1960) with the dates in the table. The given date is after the last date provided (September 30, 1960).\n   4.
