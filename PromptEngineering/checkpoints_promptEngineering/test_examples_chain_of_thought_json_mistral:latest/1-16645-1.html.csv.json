In this case, the relevant columns are \"rural , %\" and \"urban , %\".\n2. Next, we will iterate through each row of the data to find a condition where the rural percentage equals 43% and the urban percentage is greater than or equal to 57%.\n3. We start by examining the first row with index 0. The rural percentage is 72%, so it does not meet our condition.\n4. Next, we check the second row with index 1. The rural percentage is 56%, which is less than 43%, so it does not meet our condition either.\n5. We move on to the third row with index 2. The rural percentage is 50% and the urban percentage is exactly 50%. This row meets our condition, as the rural percentage equals 43% and the urban percentage is greater than or equal to 57%.\n6.
