Next, find the relevant data for each country in the table by matching their names with the \"nation\" column.\n3. For each country, locate the row index containing the bronze medal count (the fourth column) to determine the number of bronze medals each country has.\n4. Compare the total bronze medals for both countries to see if they add up to 3.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n- For Panama: { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" }\n- For Trinidad and Tobago: { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" }\n\nSince both countries have one bronze medal each, adding them up gives us 2. This is not equal to the claimed total of 3, so the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim's elements (Panama and Trinidad and Tobago, bronze medals), find relevant data for each country, compare the total bronze medals for both countries to see if they add up to the claimed total.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}]\n}",
