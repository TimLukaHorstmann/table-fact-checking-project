    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will loop through the rows of data to find any row where the result column is 'l 20 - 17'.\n2. Next, I will compare the attendance value from the row found in step 1 with all other rows to determine if there is any other game with a higher attendance.\n3. If no other game has a higher attendance, then the claim is true.\n4. If another game has a higher attendance, then the claim is false.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row(s) where result equals 'l 20 - 17'.\",\n    \"Compare the attendance value of the found row with other rows to see if there is a higher attendance.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\nIn the JSON data provided, I found one row where the result equals 'l 20 - 17' at index 8. The attendance for this game is 76059. I compared it with all other rows in the table (except the header row) and found that the attendance of 76059 is indeed the highest for any game where the result was 'l'. So, the claim is true.",
