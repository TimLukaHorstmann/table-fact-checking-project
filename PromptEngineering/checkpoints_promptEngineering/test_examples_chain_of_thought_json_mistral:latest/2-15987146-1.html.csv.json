    "resp": "Reasoning Steps:\n1. First, identify the column names in the table to understand what each piece of information represents. In this case, we are given columns for week, date, opponent, result (score), and attendance.\n2. The claim is about the score in week 13. Therefore, we must find the row where \"week\" equals 13.\n3. Scan through the data to locate the row that matches \"week\": 13. We can easily see that this occurs at index 12 in the data array (row_index: 12).\n4. Since the score is represented by the \"result\" column, we must check the value of the cell at row_index: 12 and column_name: \"result\".\n5. The value of the \"result\" cell for row 12 indicates that the score was 24 - 21 (lose 21 - 24). However, the claim states that the score is 19 - 16.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names to understand data structure\", \"Find row where 'week' equals 13\", \"Check value of 'result' cell in found row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]\n}",
