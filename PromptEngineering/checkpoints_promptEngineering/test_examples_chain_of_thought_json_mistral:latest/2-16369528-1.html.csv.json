Find the first occurrence of non-NA values in the Best Non-Fiction and Reader's Vote columns: The first row with a non-NA value in Best Non-Fiction is at row 11 (2011), but this doesn't match the claim since it is before 2005. The first row with a non-NA value in Reader's Vote is at row 7 (2001), which does match the claim.\n\n3. Filter the data for rows after 2005 and check if they won Lifetime Achievement:\n   - For the rows from 14 to 22, no cell under the \"lifetime achievement\" column contains a non-NA value (Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey & Lindsay Simpson are not in this list).\n   - Row 7 (2001) has \"apartment 255 by bunty avieson\" for Reader's Vote and \"patrick gallagher\" for Lifetime Achievement. This means that Patrick Gallagher won Lifetime Achievement in a year before 2005, which does not fulfill the claim criteria.\n   - Row 6 (2006) has \"na\" for Reader's Vote and \"andrew rule and john silvester\" for Lifetime Achiement. Since it fulfills the condition for non-NA values in Reader's Vote after 2005, we need to check if any of Andrew Rule or John Silvester have won the Lifetime Achievement award before. However, there are no rows before 2006 with their names under the \"lifetime achievement\" column, so it seems that they didn't win the Lifetime Achievement award before 2005.\n   - Similarly, for Marele Day (row 8) and shane maloney (row 9), we find no evidence of them winning the Lifetime Achievement award before 2005 as well.\n   - Finally, in row 10 (2007), Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson win the Reader's Vote but there is no winner for the Lifetime Achievement award in this table after 2005.\n\n4.
