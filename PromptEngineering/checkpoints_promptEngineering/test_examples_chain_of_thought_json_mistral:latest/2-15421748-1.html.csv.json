First, identify the team that holds the fifth position by looking at the \"data\" array and determining their position column value (in our case, it's 5).\n2. From the data row with a position of 5, find the column called \"difference\". This will give us the goal difference for this team.\n3. Inspect the value in the \"difference\" column for the row with a position of 5 to determine if it equals 0 or not.\n\nThe answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row that corresponds to the fifth position.\",\n    \"Identify the 'difference' column in this row.\"\n   ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"difference\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Identify the columns and their purpose in the table. In this case, we have seven columns: position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, and difference.\n\n2. Identify the row that corresponds to position 5 from the data array. This is the fifth row, indexed at 4 (as arrays are zero-indexed). The team for this position is \"mackenzie\".\n\n3. Find the column that contains the differences in the table. This column is named \"difference\".\n\n4. In the row of position 5, find the value in the \"difference\" column. For \"mackenzie\", this value is \"0\".\n\n5. Compare the difference value found for position 5 with all other differences in the table. To do this, iterate through the remaining rows (excluding position 5) and compare their corresponding \"difference\" values.\n\n6. If no difference value is less than the one found for position 5, then the claim \"position 5 have the lowest difference of all the positions\" is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n   The relevant cells are:\n   [\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"difference\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"difference\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"difference\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"difference\" }\n   ]\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the columns and their purpose.
