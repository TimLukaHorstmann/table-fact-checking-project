    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that when the girl doubles is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia, the boy doubles are Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\n2. Determine the relevant columns in the table: Since we are interested in the years when the girl doubles is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia, we need to find her row index first. Then, we will check the boy doubles column for that specific row.\n\n3. Locate Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia in the table: Go through each row in the \"girls doubles\" column until we find a match for \"Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia\". In this case, it's in row 4 (2004).\n\n4. Check if the boy doubles for that year matches with Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita: Now that we know the row index, we can look at the \"boys doubles\" column for the same row. In this case, it's \"jones ralfy jansen\" and \"dandi prabudita\", which matches with the claim.\n\n5. Validate if the whole pattern holds: To ensure that there are no other discrepancies in the table, we should also check if every occurrence of Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia as girls doubles has Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita as boy doubles. However, there is only one match for this pattern, so further validation is not necessary in this case.\n\n6.
