In this case, it's not explicitly stated, but since we are given a table of matches played by Karol Beck, Roko Karanusic, Matthias Bachinger, and Arnaud Clement, we can assume that the claim is about one of these players. To confirm this, we would need to check if Vasselin's name appears in the \"opponent\" column.\n\n2. Examine the \"opponent\" column to see if it contains any instances of \"Vasselin.\" Since there are no rows with a player named Vasselin as the opponent, we can infer that our players (Karol Beck, Roko Karanusic, Matthias Bachinger, and Arnaud Clement) have not played against a player named Vasselin.\n\n3.
