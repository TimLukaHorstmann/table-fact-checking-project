Identify the key terms in the claim for easier searching in the table:\n   - \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano\" (the title)\n   - \"cardinal - deacon\" (the position of the individual holding the title)\n   - \"spanish\" (the nationality, which is relevant if we want to find a cardinal-deacon from that order)\n\n2. Loop through each row in the data array:\n   - For each row, check if the \"title\" column matches \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano\". If it does, store the row index for further reference.\n   - Then, check if the \"nationality\" column matches \"spanish\". If it does and the current row has already been identified as having the target title, then this is the relevant row.\n\n3. Check if any row meets both conditions (title and nationality).\n\n4. Output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key terms in claim\",\n    \"Loop through each row in data array\",\n    \"Check if title matches 'deacon of ss cosma e damiano'\",\n    \"Check if nationality matches 'spanish' (if already found, it's the relevant row)\",\n    \"Check if any row meets both conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: In this table, there is no cardinal-deacon from the Spanish order who holds the title of deacon of ss cosma e damiano. So the claim is FALSE.",
