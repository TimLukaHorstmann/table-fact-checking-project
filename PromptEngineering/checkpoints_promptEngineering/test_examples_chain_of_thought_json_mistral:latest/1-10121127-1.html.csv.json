Identify the claim: The claim states that 65 Australian personnel were involved in the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia from 1991 to 1992.\n\n2.

Search the \"data\" array for an entry with the operation name \"unamir ii\" (which matches the claim's operation name) and location containing \"cambodia\" (as per the date range specified in the claim). This will give us a row index.\n\n4. Once we have the row index, check the corresponding \"number of australians involved\" column to see if it matches the number given in the claim (65).\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n- { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"number of australians involved\" }\n\nAfter searching the table according to the specified steps, we find that the row with index 18 matches the operation name and location specified in the claim.
