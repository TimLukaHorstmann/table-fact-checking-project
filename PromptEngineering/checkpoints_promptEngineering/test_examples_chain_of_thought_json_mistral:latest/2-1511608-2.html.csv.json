Identify the claim's components: The claim consists of two parts, a condition about the net profit/loss value and a condition about the basic eps (sek) value, as well as an employee average/year condition.\n\n2. Find the relevant row for the net profit/loss value: To check the first condition, we need to find the row where the 'net profit / loss (sek)' column matches '- 114000000'. In this table, that row index is 19 (which corresponds to year 2001).\n\n3. Check if the basic eps (sek) value in the relevant row meets the condition: Now that we have identified the correct row, we can check if its 'basic eps (sek)' column value equals '- 6.58'. In this case, it does (- 6.58 = - 6.58).\n\n4. Check if the employee average/year value in the relevant row meets the condition: Lastly, we need to verify that the 'employees (average / year)' column value in the same row is larger than 31034. In this case, it is not (31035 < 31034).\n\nSince the employee average/year condition was not met, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's my final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the components of the claim\", \"Find the relevant row for the net profit/loss value\", \"Check if the basic eps (sek) value meets the condition\", \"Check if the employee average/year value meets the condition\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"basic eps (sek)\"}, {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"employees (average / year)\"}]\n}",

Identify the claim requirements: The net profit/loss for the year 2000 (227300000 sek), an average number of employees larger than 18786, and a total number of passengers flown greater than 23239000.\n\n2. Find the row that matches the year 2000: In the data array, find the row where \"year ended\" is equal to 2000. The relevant cell is {row_index: 0}.\n\n3. Verify the net profit/loss (sek) for the year 2000: Check if the value at the column 'net profit / loss (sek)' in row 0 equals 227300000. The value is indeed equal to 227300000.\n\n4. Verify whether the average number of employees is larger than 18786: Compare the average number of employees per year at row 0 with the given value (18786). In our table, the average number of employees in row 0 is 30939 which is indeed greater than 18786.\n\n5. Verify whether the total number of passengers flown is greater than 23239000: Compare the 'passengers flown' value at row 0 with the given value (23239000).

Filter the data for years within the specified range: We will look at the rows where \"year ended\" is between 2009 and 2007, inclusive. This means we'll consider rows with indexes [1], [2], [3], and [4].\n3. Check if there are any matching rows for the basic EPS (sek): We want to find a row where the \"basic eps (sek)\" value is -6.58. Unfortunately, there is no row in our data that matches this specific EPS value.\n4. Check if there are any alternative matches: The claim also mentions that it's acceptable if the employee average is larger than 31035. Let's check which rows fulfill this condition:\n   - Row with index [2] has \"employees (average / year)\" equal to 24635, which is less than the specified value of 31035.\n   - Row with index [3] has \"employees (average / year)\" equal to 26538, which is slightly larger than the specified value of 31035.\n   - Rows [1] and [4] are not relevant for this condition as their employee averages are smaller than 31035.\n5.
