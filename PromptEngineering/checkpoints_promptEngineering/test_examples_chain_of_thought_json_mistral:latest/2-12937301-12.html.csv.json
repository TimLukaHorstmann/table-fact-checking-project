Check the value under the \"signed\" column for the University of Southern California (John Herbst's row). The value is \"no twins - 1967\".\n5. Compare this value to the claim: \"the university of southern california have no twin - 1967 list under the signed category\". Here, we observe that there seems to be a discrepancy between the table and the claim as the claim says 'no' under the signed category, but in the table, it says \"no twins - 1967\".\n6. Since the provided table contains data about players who have signed and not signed (yes or no), we can infer that the absence of a 'yes' or 'no' indicates that the player has not signed.

To find if John Herbst was drafted, we look at the 'signed' column for his row and observe that it says \"no twins - 1967\".

This translates to checking if the school \"university of southern california\" has a player who is not twinned and was signed in 1967.\n2. Identify relevant columns: Since we are looking for information about the school, we need the \"school\" column.

Check if signed and not twinned: For any row where the school matches, check if the \"signed\" value is \"yes\" (indicating the player is signed) and if there's no entry for the player with \"name\" or any other unique identifier in the table that has a twin status different from \"no twins - 1967\". If both conditions are met, consider this a potential match.\n6. Check the year: For any potential match found in step 5, check if the \"round\" value corresponds to 1967 (since it is assumed that the round number represents the year).

To assess the claim, we should look for any row where the school name matches USC and the value in the \"signed\" column is different from \"no twins - 1967\". In our table, no such row exists.
