Determine the structure of the table: The table contains a list of columns and a list of data rows. Each data row consists of values corresponding to each column.\n\n3. Identify the relevant row in the table: To verify the claim, we need to find the row in the data that corresponds to South Melbourne playing at Lake Oval. In this case, the relevant row is the fourth one, as it contains \"south melbourne\" and \"lake oval\".\n\n4. Verify the score: Check the values of the home team score column for the identified row. If they match 8.18 (66), then the claim is true; otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" }\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Determine table structure\", \"Find relevant row\", \"Verify score\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" } ]\n}",

Find the relevant row(s) in the table for South Melbourne as the away team playing at Lake Oval: To verify this claim, we look for a row where the \"away team\" column has a value of \"South Melbourne\" and the \"venue\" column has a value of \"Lake Oval\".\n3. Check the score of South Melbourne in that game: If we find such a row, we then check the value in the \"away team score\" column for that row to see if it matches the score given in the claim (8.18 or 66).\n4.
