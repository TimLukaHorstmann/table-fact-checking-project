Understand the table structure: The table contains a list of columns (denomination, metal, weight, shape, size) and data for each row representing a different coin.\n\n3. Compare the claim with the table data: We need to find the row in the table where the denomination is \"one rupee\". If that row also has the weight 10 g and size 28 mm, then the claim is true.\n\n4. Search the table for the relevant row: In this case, we are looking for a row with \"denomination\" equal to \"one rupee\". The first row meets this condition.\n\n5. Verify the weight and size for the found row: Check if the weight (in the third column) is 10 g and size (in the fourth column) is 28 mm for the first row.\n\n6.
