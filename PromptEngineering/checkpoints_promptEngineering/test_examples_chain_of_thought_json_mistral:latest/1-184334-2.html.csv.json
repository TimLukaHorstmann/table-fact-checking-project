Verify the table structure: Ensure that the table provided is correctly structured and contains the relevant data.\n\n3. Locate the row related to the district \"santa mesa\": In this table, districts are represented by the second column (index 1). So, I will look for a row where the value in the second column matches \"santa mesa\".\n\n4. Check the population data: After locating the row of \"santa mesa\", I will examine the third column (index 2) to find the district's population data from the 2010 census.\n\n5. Compare the claim with the table data: Finally, compare the claim value (99993) with the value obtained in step 4 to determine whether they match or not.\n\nThe final answer will be as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim to be tested\",\n    \"Verify the table structure\",\n    \"Locate the row related to the district 'santa mesa'\",\n    \"Check the population data\",\n    \"Compare the claim with the table data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"population (2010 census)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
