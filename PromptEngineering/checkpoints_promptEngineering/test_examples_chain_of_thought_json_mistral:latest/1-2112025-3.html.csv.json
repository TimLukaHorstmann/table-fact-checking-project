    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine if the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the specific tennis player mentioned in the claim, which is Billie Jean King (or Owen King, as they were married at the time).\n2. Check the table for rows where the 'partner' column matches the identified player's name (either \"Billie jean king\" or \"bob hewitt\", her husband during this period).\n3. Verify if any of these rows also have a year value greater than 1968, as per the claim requirement.\n4. For each row found in step 2, check if the 'outcome' is either 'winner' or 'runner - up', since the final is played between two players.\n5. If any of the rows satisfy the conditions from steps 3 and 4, look for opponents who have a name that includes \"king\" (to account for Billie Jean King and her husband Bob Hewitt).\n6. If an opponent's name matches the condition in step 5, the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nAfter analyzing the given table, I found that there are two rows matching the criteria set in steps 2 and 4: rows with indices 0 and 7. The 'partner' for both these rows matches the identified player's name. However, neither of these rows have an opponent with a name containing \"king\". Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find tennis player mentioned in claim (Billie Jean King)\",\n    \"Check if any row has partner as identified player\",\n    \"Verify if year is greater than 1968 for found rows\",\n    \"Check if outcome is 'winner' or 'runner - up' for found rows\",\n    \"Find opponents who have a name that includes 'king'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"partner\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the column names and data rows from the table. The column names are [\"outcome\", \"year\", \"championship\", \"surface\", \"partner\", \"opponents in the final\", \"score in the final\"]. The data rows contain the specific values for each match.\n\n2. Extract only the rows that represent matches before the year 1971. In this table, there are no matches after the year 1973 so all rows can be considered relevant. However, to answer the claim we only need to consider rows where the \"year\" is less than or equal to 1970.\n\n3. Check the \"surface\" column for these relevant rows. According to the table, all matches before the year 1971 were played on a clay surface.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table structure and its data.\",\n    \"Filter the data to only include matches before 1971.\",\n    \"Check the 'surface' column for these filtered rows.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
