    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim conditions: The claim states that there should be a season where the blocks per game is 2.4, and the field goal percentage is 594 (which is not explicitly stated as being in second place).\n\n2. Check for seasons with the specified field goal percentage (594): The table shows only one occurrence where the field goal percentage is exactly 594, which happens to be the fourth row, representing the season from October/November 2010. However, it's important to note that this value isn't explicitly stated as being in second place, so this condition alone doesn't necessarily confirm or deny the claim.\n\n3. Check for seasons with the specified number of blocks per game (2.4): The table does not contain any row where blocks per game is 2.4, so this condition is not met in the given data.\n\n4. Since none of the conditions in the claim are fully satisfied, we can conclude that the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify conditions from the claim\",\n    \"Find seasons with specified field goal percentage (594)\",\n    \"Check for seasons with specified number of blocks per game (2.4)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"field goal percentage\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
