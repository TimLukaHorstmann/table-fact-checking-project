The column names represent years, so we can confirm that 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 correspond to the rows in this table.\n\n2. Examine the data for the US Open in each year:\n   - In 2007, the cell value is \"sf\" (semifinals)\n   - In 2008, the cell value is \"2r\" (second round)\n   - In 2009, the cell value is \"2r\" (second round)\n   - In 2010, the cell value is \"2r\" (second round)\n   - In 2011, the cell value is \"3r\" (third round), not \"2r\"\n   - In 2012, the cell value is \"sf\" (semifinals), not \"2r\"\n\n3. Compare the given claim with the data obtained in step 2:\n   - The US Open had an \"sf\" categorization between 2007 and 2009, which is correct.\n   - However, the US Open did not have a \"2r\" categorization between 2010 and 2012, as stated in the claim.
