Identify the claim's specific details: The claim states that the event in question occurred on April 17 and the home team should be the Chicago Blackhawks with a record of 2 - 3.\n\n2. Check the table data for the specified date (April 17): We need to find a row where the \"date\" column matches \"april 17\".\n\n3. If found, examine the \"home\" and \"record\" columns: Once we have identified the relevant row, we will check if the \"home\" column matches \"chicago black hawks\" and the \"record\" column contains a string that represents a record of 2 - 3 (i.e., two wins and three losses).\n\n4. Determine the truth value of the claim: If both conditions in step 3 are met, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the specific details in the claim\",\n    \"Find a row with date = 'april 17'\",\n    \"Check if the home team matches 'chicago black hawks'\",\n    \"Verify that the record equals '2 - 3'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
