In this case, the table consists of a list of wrestlers, their reigns, days held, location, and event. Each row represents one wrestler.\n\n2. Examine the given claim: \"all wrestlers, including vacate, have held at least 3 reigns\". This means that every single entry in the 'wrestler' column should meet this criterion.\n\n3. Examine the table data to find out if any of the wrestlers have held less than 3 reigns. If there are any such entries, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it is TRUE.\n\n4. Analyze the table data:\n   - The 'wrestler' column contains unique entries for each row, except for the entry \"vacated\". This implies that there may be multiple rows with different reigns and days held for each wrestler.\n   - To check if any of these wrestlers have held less than 3 reigns, we need to go through every row.\n\n5. Go through each row:\n   - The first row contains the entry \"filoso\", which is a single reign. Move on to the next one.\n   - The second row contains \"osamu namiguchi\", also a single reign. Continue.\n   - The third row contains \"katsuhiko nakajima\", with 1 reign and 297 days held, which meets our criterion of at least 3 reigns (since it's the first reign). Proceed to the next one.\n   - The fourth row contains \"tatsuhito takaiwa\", a single reign. Go on.\n   - The fifth row contains the entry \"vacated\", which doesn't have a reign number. Since this is not a wrestler, it does not count towards our claim. Move on to the last one.\n   - The sixth row contains \"the\\u2605zest\", with 1 reign and 261 days held, which meets our criterion of at least 3 reigns (since it's the first reign). Proceed to the final row.\n   - The seventh row contains \"noiz\", with a single reign but an unknown number of days held as \"2127 +\". This is more than 3 reigns if we consider this as a new reign starting from the \"+\".
