    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the column names from the table to understand what data each column represents. In this case, we have columns for rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total.\n2. Check if there is any row in the table that corresponds to Germany based on the \"nation\" column. From the provided table, the third row represents China, the fourth and fifth rows represent Australia and Netherlands respectively, and so on. The seventh row matches our search criteria as it contains \"germany\".\n3. Verify if the value in the \"gold\" column for Germany (row 7) is equal to 0. Indeed, it is, as the value in that cell is 0.\n4. Verify if there is any row in the table where the nation matches Germany and the value in the \"silver\" column is not equal to 0. From the table we can see that the value in the silver column for Germany (row 7) is indeed 5.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the columns in the table\", \"Check if there's a row for Germany\", \"Verify if Germany has 0 gold medals\", \"Verify if Germany has silver medals other than 0\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\" }\n  ]\n}",
