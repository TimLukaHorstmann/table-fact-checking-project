Identify the claim's components: The claim states that player Tero Lehtera has a pick number of 238, is from Slovakia, plays the centre position, and was part of Bodens BK (Sweden).\n\n2. Find the relevant row in the data: We will look for the row where \"player\" equals \"tero lehtera\". The relevant row is the first one with an index of 0.\n\n3. Check the pick number: In the first row, the \"pick\" value is 235, not 238, so this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. Check the nationality and position: In the first row, the \"nationality\" is Finland, but we know that Tero Lehtera is a Finnish player, so this isn't relevant for checking the claim. However, his position in the table is \"centre\", which matches the claimed position, so this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n5. Check the team: In the first row, the \"nhl team\" is Florida Panthers, not Bodens BK (Sweden), so this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n6.
