Filter the table data to only include games where the final score (score column) has the values 7 or 2, and where both values appear. This will help us narrow down the games that could potentially be the ones with a score of 7-2.\n\n2. After filtering, check if there are exactly 2 unique matches found. If more than 2 games have a final score of 7-2, then it is impossible for the final game score to be 7-2 in only 2 different games of the 2006 season (as per the claim).\n\n3. If there are exactly 2 unique matches found, compare their opponent columns to ensure they are not the same team. If both teams are the same, then it is still possible for the final game score to be 7-2 in 2 different games of the 2006 season (as per the claim), but we need more information (such as the date) to determine which specific games they refer to.\n\n4. If there are exactly 2 unique matches found, and their opponent columns show different teams, then it is possible for the final game score to be 7-2 in 2 different games of the 2006 season (as per the claim), assuming no other games share the same score or opponent.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n\n1. Filter the table data based on the score column having values 7 and 2.\n\n2. From the filtered data, compare each game to find duplicate scores of 7-2 (final score).\n\n3.
