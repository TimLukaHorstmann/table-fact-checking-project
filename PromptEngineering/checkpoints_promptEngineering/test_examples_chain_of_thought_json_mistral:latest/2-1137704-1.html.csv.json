    "resp": "Here is the reasoning steps to determine if there are 3 entrants with the Ferrari 038 3.5 v12 engine:\n\n1. Examine each row of the data to find teams using the Ferrari 038 3.5 v12 engine.\n2. Check the \"Engine\" column for any instances where it matches \"Ferrari 038 3.5 v12\".\n3. Count the number of unique teams found with the specified engine type (i.e., exclude repeated occurrences of a team).\n4. Compare the counted teams to determine if there are exactly 3 teams using the Ferrari 038 3.5 v12 engine.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis would be:\n- Row_index = 9 (scuderia ferrari), column_name = \"Engine\"\n- Row_index = 14 (scuderia ferrari), column_name = \"Engine\"\n- Row_index = 18 (scuderia ferrari), column_name = \"Engine\"\n\nThe chain of thought is as follows:\n1. There are three instances where the engine is Ferrari 038 3.5 v12 (rows 9, 14, and 18).\n2. Since there are no repeated occurrences of teams within the data, we can count each team only once (i.e., Scuderia Ferrari appears three times, but we count it as one unique team).\n3. The number of unique teams using Ferrari 038 3.5 v12 is equal to 1 (since there's only one unique team across the relevant rows).\n4. However, the claim states that there should be exactly 3 teams using this engine, so our answer is FALSE.\n\nThe final JSON object would look like:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine each row to find teams with Ferrari 038 3.5 v12 engine.\",\n    \"Check the 'Engine' column for instances of Ferrari 038 3.5 v12.\",\n    \"Count the number of unique teams found with this engine.\",\n    \"Compare the counted teams to the specified number in the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"Engine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"Engine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"Engine\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
