    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to arrive at my answer:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The latest stage win by Mikhail Ignatiev was on stage 6.\n2. Understand the structure of the table: The table contains data from multiple stages and classifications, but we only need to focus on the stage column to verify the claim.\n3. Locate each row containing information about a stage: In this case, there are 7 rows (indexed from 0 to 6), and we know that Mikhail Ignatiev's latest win was on one of these stages.\n4. Compare each stage winner with the claimant: For each row, check if the winner column matches \"Mikhail Ignatiev\". If it does, then this might be the stage where he won (since we are looking for his latest win).\n5. Find the index of the relevant row: In this case, the relevant row is the one with a winner equal to \"Mikhail ignatiev\" and the index of that row is 6.\n6. Determine if the stage number from the table matches the claim: If the row_index plus 1 (since the data starts at 0) equals the stage number in the claim, then the claim is TRUE. In this case, 6 + 1 = 7, and according to the table, the stage number for the winning row is also 7. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n   Here's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Understand the structure of the table\", \"Locate each row containing information about a stage\", \"Compare each stage winner with the claimant\", \"Find the index of the relevant row\", \"Determine if the stage number from the table matches the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"stage\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim, which is whether the latest stage win by Daniele Bennati is at stage 6.\n2. Determine the order of the data in the table, which appears to be chronological by stage number (going from 1 to 7).\n3. Search for the row where the \"winner\" column value is \"daniele bennati\". This happens at row index 3.\n4. Check the stage number corresponding to this row, which is 3. Since the data appears to be chronological and we've reached a later stage without finding a more recent win by Bennati, it means that his latest stage win was indeed at stage 3.\n5. Compare the claimed (stage 6) and found (stage 3) values.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim, Determine table order, Search for 'daniele bennati' in the 'winner' column, Check the corresponding stage number, Compare the claimed and found values.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"stage\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
