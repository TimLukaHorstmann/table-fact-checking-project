So, we need to find a row where \"replaced by\" equals \"erg\u00fcn penbe\".\n\n3.

Find the team for which the claim is made: The claim is about team 'altay'.\n\n3. Check if the manager who replaced the previous manager of team 'altay' is mentioned in the table: To do this, I will search for the replaced manager of 'altay' (in this case, ercan ertem\u00e7\u00f6z) and then find out who replaces him by looking at the 'replaced by' column of the next row (if any).\n\n4. Identify the row in the table where the claim is made: In this case, the row index for team 'altay' is 6. The relevant cell for the replaced manager of altay is the one with the \"replaced by\" column name and row_index 6 (since we know that the manager of altay left the team).\n\n5. Verify if the manager who replaces ercan ertem\u00e7\u00f6z is also the previous manager of another team mentioned in the table: To do this, I will search for the manager who replaced ercan ertem\u00e7\u00f6z (in this case, g\u00fcven\u00e7 kurtar) and then find out if he appears as 'replaced by' for any other team.\n\n6. If the manager who replaces ercan ertem\u00e7\u00f6z is also the previous manager of another team mentioned in the table: I will check if this other team is team 'altay' (the one the claim was made about). If so, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n7. Identify the row for g\u00fcven\u00e7 kurtar: In this case, the row index for g\u00fcven\u00e7 kurtar is 0 (since he was the manager of team 'ankaraspor'). The relevant cell for the replaced by column of g\u00fcven\u00e7 kurtar is the one with the \"replaced by\" column name and row_index 0.\n\n8. Verify if the manager who replaces ercan ertem\u00e7\u00f6z (g\u00fcven\u00e7 kurtar) is also the previous manager of team 'altay': To do this, I will find out the 'replaced by' value for the first row in the table (since we know that the manager of ankaraspor left the team).\n\n9.
