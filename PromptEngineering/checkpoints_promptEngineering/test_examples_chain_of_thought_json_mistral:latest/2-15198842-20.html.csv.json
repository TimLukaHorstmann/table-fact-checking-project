Check if any other positions have players drafted more than once. To do this, I'll look for rows where the pick value is not unique within the data column (i.e., there are multiple rows with the same pick value). Since no other positions have more than one player in distinct rows with the same pick value, we can assume that all positions except linebacker and defensive back had only one player drafted (as per the given table).\n\n3.

This will allow me to determine if a linebacker was ever drafted before a center in any given round.\n3.
