However, the table doesn't provide specific data about a player named \"vladimira\".\n2. Since the table represents the progress of a player (or players) in Grand Slam tournaments from 2006 to 2012, we need to find out if there is another way to identify the player based on their results in these years and tournaments.\n3. The column \"win - loss\" provides the win-loss record for each year which could potentially help us identify the player. Since we don't have any other data points, let's assume that no two players have the same win-loss record in these specific years.\n4. Compare the win-loss records for each year and look for a record that matches the furthest progress in a Grand Slam tournament. The row with the best win-loss record is the 5th row, which has \"us open\" in the first column and \"sf\" (semi finals) in the 3rd column.\n5. Since we don't have specific data about \"vladimira\", but we found a player who made it to the semi-finals of the US Open, we can conclude that if \"vladimira\" is the same player as the one with this progress, then the claim is TRUE.\n6.
