We're interested in finding if there's a defensive end and an overall pick smaller than 2.\n\n2. Scan the 'position' column for any 'defensive end': Scroll through each row to find a player with a position of \"defensive end\". If found, proceed to the next step.\n\n3. Check if there's an overall pick smaller than 2: If there is a defensive end, check if there exists any row where the 'overall' value is less than 2.\n\n4. Final answer: Depending on the results of steps 2 and 3, output either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\".\n\n   Now, let's find the relevant cells:\n   - Since we're interested in finding a defensive end and an overall pick smaller than 2, all possible rows are related to this question. However, the table doesn't contain any defensive ends with an overall pick less than 2.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Scan 'position' column for 'defensive end', Check if there's an overall pick smaller than 2\", \"No defensive ends with an overall pick smaller than 2 found in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
