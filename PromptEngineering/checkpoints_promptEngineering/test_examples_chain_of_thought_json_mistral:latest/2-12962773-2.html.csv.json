Iterate through the table data - We will go through each row of the data array and check the current club (column 4) to find players from Ironi Nahariya.\n3. Verify the year born - Since the claim states that the player was born in 1980, we will verify this information for the selected players from Ironi Nahariya.\n4. Confirm the position - As the claim specifies that the player is a forward, we will confirm if the position matches for the selected players.\n5. Check the final condition - If we find a player who is a forward for Ironi Nahariya and was born in 1980, then our answer is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the target player by name and position\",\n    \"Iterate through the table data for Ironi Nahariya players\",\n    \"Verify the year born for each player is 1980\",\n    \"Confirm the position (forward) for each player\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"current club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year born\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
