Find the match between Geelong and Carlton: Look for the rows in the table where both \"home team\" equals 'geelong' and \"away team\" equals 'carlton'.\n\n4. Compare the crowd sizes: If there is a row matching Geelong vs Carlton, check if the crowd size for this match is the largest among all matches (in the column \"crowd\").\n\n5. Verify the result of the match between Geelong and Carlton: Check if the 'home team score' for the Geelong vs Carlton match is greater than the 'away team score'.\n\n6.
