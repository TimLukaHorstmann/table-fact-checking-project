    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column that contains the year of each competition, which is \"year\".\n2. Iterate through the rows to find the years when the competition was held in New York City. This can be done by checking if the \"competition\" for a given row equals \"new york city marathon\".\n3. Extract the years for each row where the condition in step 2 is true, and compare them to find the latest year. To do this, simply sort the list of extracted years in descending order (since we want the latest one) and get the first element from the sorted list.\n4. Check if the sorted and first element matches the year for the 1985 New York City Marathon race.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the available data (venues) from the table. This can be found by looking at the \"venue\" column in the \"data\" array of the table.\n\n2. Next, we need to compare the given venue (\"venice, italy\") with the venues from our first step. If they match, then we can proceed to look for the corresponding time record.\n\n3. If the given venue does not match any of the venues in our table, then the claim is false because there's no record of that specific time being run at \"venice, italy\".\n\n4. Since the given venue (\"venice, italy\") matches with one of the venues in our table (row 5), we can now check if there's a corresponding time record for that row.\n\n5. In the row where the venue is \"venice, italy\", we need to find the cell with the \"notes\" column because that's where the time records are stored.\n\n6. If the value in the \"notes\" cell matches the given time (\"2:15:24\"), then the claim is true.\n\n7.
