    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that on Friday, August 26th (`fri 26 aug`), rider's time was `19'30.70` seconds with a speed of `116.023 mph`. However, it is also mentioned in the table that on Saturday, August 20th (`sat 20 aug`), the same rider had their race cancelled with no time recorded (`\"cancelled no time\"`).\n\n2. Check if the given date corresponds to a valid row in the data: Since the claim refers to Friday, August 26th, we need to check the corresponding row in the `data` array of the table. The row index can be calculated by counting the number of rows that correspond to days prior to August 26th. In this case, there are 5 full days (Thursday to Wednesday) and one partial day (Friday morning until Saturday morning), so the row index is `5 + 1 = 6`.\n\n3. Verify if the rider's details match: Once we have identified the correct row in the table, compare the rider's name with the one mentioned in the claim. In this case, the sixth row corresponds to rider \"david lumsden,\" and the claim mentions a different rider, \"grant wagstaff.\"\n\n4. Evaluate if the time and speed match: Since we have determined that the rider is not the same as in the claim, we can conclude that the time and speed mentioned in the claim do not correspond to August 26th. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the time and speed do not match those recorded on that day.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the given claim\",\n    \"Check if the given date corresponds to a valid row in the data\",\n    \"Verify if the rider's details match\",\n    \"Evaluate if the time and speed match\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rider\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\" }\n  ]\n}",

In this case, both 'Mon 22 Aug' and 'Wed 24 Aug' are valid columns (indexes 1 and 3 respectively).\n\n3. For each of the mentioned dates, find the corresponding rider times and speeds by looking at the respective rows in the \"data\" array. In this case:\n   - For 'Mon 22 Aug': Look for the row where the \"rider\" matches the rider in question (e.g., \"jamie coward 600cc suzuki\", etc.) and find the cell in that row with the column name \"mon 22 aug\".\n   - For 'Wed 24 Aug': Look for the row where the \"rider\" matches the rider in question (e.g., \"jamie coward 600cc suzuki\", etc.) and find the cell in that row with the column name \"wed 24 aug\".\n\n4. Compare the times and speeds found for each date. In this case, for the rider \"jamie coward 600cc suzuki\":\n   - For 'Mon 22 Aug': The time is \"20'25.35\" and speed is \"110.849 mph\".\n   - For 'Wed 24 Aug': The time is missing (\"-- no time\"), but the speed is \"116.556 mph\".\n\n5. Since the claim specifically asks about the times, and the time for 'Wed 24 Aug' is missing, we cannot compare the times directly.

Compare the times and speeds found in steps 3 with the given claim's times and speeds for thurs 25 aug (20'23.64 112.511 mph) and frid 26 aug (19'30.70 116.023 mph).\n\nNow, let me provide the final answer:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the rider in question\",\n    \"Find the relevant rows for thurs 25 aug and frid 26 aug\",\n    \"Extract the time and speed for each day from the relevant rows\",\n    \"Compare the extracted times and speeds with the given claim's times and speeds\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"tues 23 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"wed 24 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"thurs 25 aug\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"\n    }\n  ]",
