This game was against Atlanta, not NY Ranger as mentioned in the claim.\n\n6. The next game is against NY Ranger. In this game, Washington scored 0 goals, and thus did not have a score of 2.\n\n7. Lastly, we check the game against Carolina. However, in this game, Washington scored 4 goals (1-2 translates to 1 goal conceded and 4 scored).\n\nSince Washington didn't have a score of 2 in any game against either NY Ranger or Carolina, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team and opponents in the claim\",\n    \"Check for a row where 'team' is Washington and score is 2\",\n    \"Iterate through each row to check if it matches our conditions\",\n    \"Analyze each game to see if there was a score of 2 for Washington\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
