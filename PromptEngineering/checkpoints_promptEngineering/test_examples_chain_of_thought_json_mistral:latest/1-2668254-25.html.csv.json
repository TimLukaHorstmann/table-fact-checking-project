Find the row corresponding to Virginia district 19: Since the districts are listed horizontally, we need to find the row where the \"district\" column has a value of \"virginia 19\".\n\n4. Check if the year of first election matches 1811: Once we have found the correct row, we can check if the value in the \"first elected\" column matches the claimed year (1811).\n\n5.
