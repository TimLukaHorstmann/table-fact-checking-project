    "resp": "1. Identify the columns and rows in the table: The columns are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". There are 17 rows of data.\n2. Identify the specific row and column required for the claim: Since we need to find if there is an opponent with the Kansas City Chiefs (in the \"opponent\" column) in week 14 (in the \"week\" column), we are looking for the row where the \"week\" value is 14 and the \"opponent\" value is \"kansas city chiefs\".\n3. Examine the data to find the relevant row: Iterate through each row of data, comparing the values in the \"week\" and \"opponent\" columns with the specified values.\n4. Check if the matching row exists: If a row where both the \"week\" and \"opponent\" values match is found, we have a positive hit.\n5. Determine the answer to the claim: If such a row is found, the attendance value in that row will be the number of people who attended the game with Kansas City Chiefs as the opponent in week 14. In this case, the attendance was 74524 (found in the 13th row).\n6. Output the final answer: The claim is valid since the matching row exists and we have the relevant attendance information.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the columns and rows in the table\",\n    \"Find the specific row and column required for the claim\",\n    \"Examine the data to find the relevant row\",\n    \"Check if the matching row exists\",\n    \"Determine the answer to the claim\",\n    \"Output the final answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
