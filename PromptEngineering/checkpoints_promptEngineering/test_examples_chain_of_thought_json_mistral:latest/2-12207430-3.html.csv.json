Search for a row in the table that matches the given date (May 12th) and team (Royals).\n3. If found, check if it's a victory (win column > opponent's run column). If yes, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, the claim is not valid.\n4. If it's a victory, update the wins for the Toronto Blue Jays by subtracting 1 from their record (since they lost a game) and check if it now equals 18.\n5.

    "resp": "1. Identify the team we are looking for: The claim mentions the Kansas City Royals, so we will search for any row where the \"opponent\" column equals \"Royals\".\n2. Determine the starting point: The claim states that the event happened after May 12th. We will iterate through the table from the row with the index 12 (May 13th) onwards.\n3. Check for a match: For each subsequent row, look for an entry where the \"opponent\" column equals \"Royals\" and the record in the \"record\" column is greater than or equal to 18.\n4. Find the matching date: If we find a match, the date will be stored in the \"date\" (implicitly understood from the row index + 1 as days are numbered starting from 1).\n5. Confirm if it's after May 12th: Ensure that the date found is greater than or equal to 13 (May 13th) since we are searching for events that occurred after May 12th.\n6.
