The relevant rows are 4 and 5 as those rows contain the matches for Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers.\n2. Extract the scores for these two teams from the 'score' column in the identified rows (4th row: \"4 - 1\", 5th row: \"1 - 0\").\n3. Convert the scores into integers to compare them (Barnsley score: 4, Bristol Rovers score: 1).\n4. Determine the difference between the two team's scores (difference = Barnsley score - Bristol Rovers score = 4 - 1 = 3).\n5. Compare the calculated difference with other games in the table to find if there's a higher difference for any other game.\n6. There are no repeated games, so we can only compare this difference (3) with those of games that have different teams (relevant rows: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]).\n7. In the relevant rows, calculate their score differences as follows: [1] -ve for Sheffield Wednesday, [2] +1 for Everton, [3] 0 for Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers (replay), [6] 0 for Huddersfield Town and Derby County (replay). The other relevant rows have no score differences because they are replays of previously analyzed games.\n8. Compare the calculated difference (3) with the differences in the relevant rows.\n9. The calculated difference (3) is higher than the differences in all the relevant rows, so there is no other game with a higher point differential.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers games\",\n    \"Extract scores for both teams\",\n    \"Convert scores to integers\",\n    \"Calculate the difference between the two teams' scores\",\n    \"Compare the calculated difference with other games in the table\",\n    \"Analyze differences among relevant rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",

If any of the rows match the date, then there are games taking place on that day.\n4. To determine if they are FA Cup matches, we need to find games where at least one team is not a Premier League team (as the FA Cup involves teams from various tiers). In this table, all teams are from the Premier League, so it seems all games are not FA Cup games. However, note that 'replay' games could be from any tier, as they are re-matches of previous games and not necessarily part of the original FA Cup fixture.\n5. To find out if some of these 'replay' games are indeed FA Cup matches, we would need additional information about the original ties (the first game between these teams).
