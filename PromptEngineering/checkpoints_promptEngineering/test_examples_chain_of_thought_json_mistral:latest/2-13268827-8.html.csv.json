    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the key information from the table: Each row represents a specific tournament for each year (2009-2012). The first column indicates the tournament name, while the rest of the columns show the results for that tournament in their respective years. The last row shows the win-loss records for each year.\n\n2. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"a tournament has 2r in 2012 and also a 2r in 2010\". In other words, we are looking for a row (i.e., a tournament) where both the 2010 and 2012 entries under the results column are '2r'.\n\n3. Examine the data: We can see that each row contains a single entry in the \"tournament\" column, which suggests that each row represents a unique tournament. However, we need to check if any of these tournaments have a '2r' result in both 2010 and 2012.\n\n4. Determine the relevance of cells: To verify the claim, we will be looking at the cells corresponding to columns \"2010\" and \"2012\" for each unique tournament.\n\n5. Apply the verification process: We can see that the first row (Australian Open) has a '1r' in 2010 and '1r' in 2012, so it does not meet the condition. Similarly, we can check the rest of the rows (French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) and find that they also do not have a '2r' in both 2010 and 2012.\n\n6.
