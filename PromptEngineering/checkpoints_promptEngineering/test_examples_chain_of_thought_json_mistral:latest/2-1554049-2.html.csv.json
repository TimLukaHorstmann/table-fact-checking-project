Analyze the \"surface\" for relevant rows: For the given table, we find two rows with dates close to October 10, 2004, one on November 3, 2004 (carpet) and another on October 10, 2004 (hard). Since clay is not found in these rows, we need to look at the surface for other nearby dates.\n\n4. Check the \"surface\" column for neighboring dates: We examine the \"surface\" column for all tournaments on or around October 10, 2004, and find that a clay surface was used for a tournament on July 15, 2001 (Gstaad, Switzerland).\n\n5. Determine the answer: Since we found a clay surface match on a date near October 10, 2004, we can conclude that it's not possible to know definitively whether or not a clay surface was used specifically on October 10, 2004, due to incomplete data in the table.
