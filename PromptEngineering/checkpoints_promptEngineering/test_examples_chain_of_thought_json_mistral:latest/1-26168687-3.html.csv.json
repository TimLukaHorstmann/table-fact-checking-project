    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim components: The claim consists of two parts - a comparison between two vessels (mv resolution and tyco resolute) based on their rank within the season and their finishing positions.\n\n2. Understand the context: The table provided is a list of ships, each with details such as number in series, number in season, title, vessel type, operator, narrated by, and original air date (assuming \"air date\" refers to the year they were active). Since there's no explicit mention of \"season\", we can infer that the number within the bracket next to \"no in season\" represents their rank within the season.\n\n3. Determine the vessels' ranks: To find out the rank of mv resolution and tyco resolute, we will look for the values in the second column (since it corresponds to \"no in season\"). We can see that mv resolution is at row 0 with a value of 1, indicating it is the first vessel in the season. Tyco resolute is at row 11, with a value of 12, which means it is ranked 12th (not in our top 7 vessels).\n\n4. Compare their finishing positions: The claim also mentions that mv resolution should finish 7 ranks above tyco resolute. Since the rank of mv resolution is 1 and tyco resolute's rank is 12, a difference of 7 rows or ranks exists between them.\n\n5. Answer the question: Comparing both parts of the claim with the findings from our analysis, we can see that mv resolution is indeed the number 1 in the season (top vessel) and finishes 7 ranks above tyco resolute (with a rank difference of exactly 7), making the claim TRUE.\n\nNow, the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim components\",\n    \"Understand context\",\n    \"Determine vessels' ranks\",\n    \"Compare their finishing positions\",\n    \"Answer the question\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"no in season\" }\n  ]\n}",
