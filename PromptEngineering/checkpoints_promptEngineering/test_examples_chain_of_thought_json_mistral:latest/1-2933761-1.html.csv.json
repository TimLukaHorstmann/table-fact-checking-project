The claim states that only a person listed as a prison escapist has a status of dead.

However, all of these individuals have a status of dead.\n   - Row 4 (joan leaven) has a \"prison connection\" as Leavenworth prison (USA), which does not explicitly state that she was an escapist but it can be inferred since all other prisoners associated with Leavenworth are dead and they were listed as prison escapees.\n   - Finally, Row 6 (rennes) is the only individual who is a prison escapist (Centre p\u00e9nitentiaire de Rennes, France).\n\n5. Comparing rows 4 and 6:\n   - Joan leaven was associated with Leavenworth prison (USA), but the claim states that prison escapists have a status of dead.
