We see that there is a row with \"corning classic\" as the tournament name and \"may 30 , 1982\" as the date.\n2. Check for the runner-up of this tournament. In the table, the column for runners-up only contains one player or players in case of a playoff. Since Patty Sheehan's name is not mentioned in any of the rows under the \"runner (s) - up\" column, we first assume that she did not win but might have been a runner-up in a playoff.\n3. Look for any rows with a \"playoff\" listed in the \"margin of victory\" or absence of a winning score in the \"winning score\" column. We find one such row corresponding to the corning classic on May 30, 1982, and Patty Sheehan's name is mentioned in the \"answer\" column (as the winner). This means that there was indeed a playoff, but Patty Sheehan won it, so we need to check other players who participated in this playoff.\n4. To find out if Patty Sheehan was the runner-up, we should see if she is listed under any of the rows where a playoff took place with another player(s). However, in our table, there are no rows that specify the runners-up from a playoff other than those mentioned as winners.\n5. Since Patty Sheehan is the only player listed as the winner of the corning classic on May 30, 1982, and we don't have any information about other players who might have participated in the playoff, it is impossible to confirm if she was the runner-up without more data.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find tournament details for May 30, 1982\",\n    \"Check for the runner-up of this tournament\",\n    \"Look for any rows with a 'playoff' in the 'margin of victory' or absence of a winning score in the 'winning score' column\",\n    \"Find out if Patty Sheehan was listed as a runner-up from the playoff\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winning score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\" }\n  ]\n}",
