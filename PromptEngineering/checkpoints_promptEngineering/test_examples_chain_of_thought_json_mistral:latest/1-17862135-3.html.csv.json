Check if the total points for \"rocco & karina\" match the claim: 89 == 89 (true)\n4. Check if the number of dances for \"rocco & karina\" matches the claim: 5 == 5 (true)\n5. Since there is no average value provided in the table for \"rocco & karina\", calculate it using the total points and number of dances from step 2: 89 / 5 = 17.8\n6.
