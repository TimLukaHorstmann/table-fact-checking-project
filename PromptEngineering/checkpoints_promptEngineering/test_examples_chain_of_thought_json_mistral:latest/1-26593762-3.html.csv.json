    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. First, we need to identify when George Burley was sacked from his team (according to the claim, it should be Crystal Palace). We can find this information by scanning the table for rows where the 'team' is Crystal Palace and the 'manner of departure' is 'sacked'.\n2. After finding the row corresponding to George Burley being sacked from Crystal Palace, we can note down the date of his departure (which is 1st January 2011 according to the table).\n3. Next, we need to check if there was an incoming manager for Crystal Palace after George Burley's departure. We can find this by scanning the table for rows where the 'team' is Crystal Palace and the 'date of appointment' is later than the date of George Burley's departure (1st January 2011).\n4. If we find an incoming manager, we should check if his name is Gary Speed. In this case, we can see that there is an incoming manager for Crystal Palace after George Burley's departure and his name is Dougie Freedman, not Gary Speed. However, we should also consider the possibility of another event happening (George Burley being sacked and then the team having an incoming manager whose name is not Gary Speed).\n5. To address the remaining possibility, we need to check if there was a subsequent change in management for Crystal Palace after Dougie Freedman's appointment, and whether the new manager's name is Gary Speed. We can do this by scanning the table again for rows where the 'team' is Crystal Palace, the 'date of departure' is later than George Burley's date of departure (1st January 2011), and the 'date of appointment' is later than Dougie Freedman's date of appointment (12th January 2011).\n6. We find that there was another change in management for Crystal Palace after Dougie Freedman, and the new manager's name is indeed Gary Speed. However, this event occurred after George Burley's sacking and not immediately after it.\n7. To answer the claim, we need to determine if it is possible to have a sequence of events where George Burley was sacked (which we confirmed), followed by an incoming manager whose name is not Gary Speed (we found Dougie Freedman in this case), and then another change in management with Gary Speed taking over (which we also found). In this scenario, the claim would be partially true, as George Burley was indeed sacked, but it took time for Gary Speed to become the manager.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find row where team is Crystal Palace and manner of departure is 'sacked'.\",\n    \"Check if there's an incoming manager after George Burley was sacked.\",\n    \"Look for a subsequent change in management with Gary Speed as the new manager.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"date of departure\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\" }\n  ]\n}",
