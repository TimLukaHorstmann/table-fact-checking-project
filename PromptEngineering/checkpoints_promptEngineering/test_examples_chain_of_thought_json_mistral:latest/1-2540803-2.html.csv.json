We find that the first material, sunflower oil, has more than 100g of total fat, so it does not meet the criteria. Similarly, we can confirm that the other seven materials (soybean oil, canola oil, olive oil, corn oil, peanut oil, rice bran oil, and lard) also have more than 100g of total fat.\n4. However, the last material, vegetable shortening, has 71g of fat, which is less than 100g (since it's not a full 100g serving). This means it meets the criteria for the claim to be true.\n5. We have already confirmed that none of the other materials have less than 100g of fat.\n6. Finally, we find suet in row 9 and observe that it also has more than 100g of total fat (94g).
