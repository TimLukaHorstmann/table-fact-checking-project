From the 'country' column, we can see that there are several countries represented in the data.\n   2. Next, for each country, we need to find out which films were nominated at the \"prix uip venezia\" festival. However, since the 'nominating festival' column mentions only \"prix uip\" followed by a city name and not \"prix uip venezia\", it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the claim.\n   3. We should look for rows where the country is Germany (since that's the one mentioned in the claim), but since the festival information doesn't seem to match what was claimed, we can't make a definitive answer based on this table alone.\n\nSince the festival name in the claim doesn't exactly correspond to any entry in the table, I cannot confirm whether the claim is true or false with certainty.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify countries in the data\",\n    \"Check if any films from Germany were nominated at 'prix uip venezia'\",\n    \"Since the festival information doesn't exactly match what was claimed, we can't make a definitive answer based on this table alone\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INDETERMINABLE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nominating festival\" }\n  ]\n}",
