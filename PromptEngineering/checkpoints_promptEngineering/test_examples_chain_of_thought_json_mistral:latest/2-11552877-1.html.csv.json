To determine if the claim is true or false, we will compare the \"time / retired\" values for each driver mentioned in the claim (jo vonlanthen and tony trimmer). The time is either a specific duration or \"+ x laps\", where x is the number of laps behind the leader.\n\n3. For jo vonlanthen, we find the row with \"driver\": \"jo vonlanthen\". In this row, the \"time / retired\" value is \"+ 1 lap\".\n\n4. For tony trimmer, we find the row with \"driver\": \"tony trimmer\". In this row, the \"time / retired\" value is \"+ 6 laps\".\n\n5. Comparing the two drivers, jo vonlanthen has a time of \"+ 1 lap\" and tony trimmer has a time of \"+ 6 laps\", which is indeed more than + 3 laps.\n\nThe final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand the table structure, find the rows related to the drivers in question (jo vonlanthen and tony trimmer), compare their 'time / retired' values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
