    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the player whose information is required for comparison: The claim mentions 'cole', so we need to find the relevant row with the player's name.\n\n2. Find the row containing 'cole': We search the data array for a row where the first element is equal to 'cole'.\n\n3. Extract the field goal information: Once we have found the correct row, we extract the second element of the row (field goals). This will give us the number of made and missed field goals in the format \"made - missed total\".\n\n4. Parse the field goal data into individual values: Split the extracted field goal data by spaces to separate made, missed, and total field goals. In this case, we get \"18 - 50 360\" where the first value is the number of made field goals, the second value is the number of missed field goals, and the third value is the average (which we don't need for this claim).\n\n5. Compare the extracted number of field goals with the claimed average: To compare the extracted number of field goals with the claimed average, we convert both to a common format (fraction). In this case, the number of made field goals is already in the correct format, so we only need to convert the claimed average (360) into 360/50.\n\n6. Perform the comparison: Compare the extracted number of made field goals with the calculated claimed average as a fraction (i.e., 18 = 18/50 and 360/50 = 7.2). Since they are equal, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's present the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row containing 'cole'\",\n    \"Extract the field goal information\",\n    \"Parse the field goal data into individual values\",\n    \"Compare the extracted number of field goals with the claimed average\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"field goals\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that the player \"cole\" has \"18 - 50 360\" field goals.\n\n2. Parse the table structure: The table has two main parts, columns and data. Each column represents a specific attribute (player, field goals, three pointers, free throws, assists, steals, rebounds, points). Each row in the data section contains the values for these attributes for a single player.\n\n3. Locate the relevant row: To verify if \"cole\" appears in any of the rows, we compare the player column in each row with \"cole\". Since \"cole\" appears only once in the table (in the 10th row), this is the relevant row.\n\n4. Extract the field goal data: In the relevant row, the field goals are represented as a string \"18 - 50 360\". We need to extract the numbers corresponding to the number of made field goals (18), missed field goals (50), and total points scored from field goals (360).\n\n5. Compare with the claim: Now we can compare these extracted values with the numbers in the claim (\"18 - 50 360\"). If they match, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Parse table structure\", \"Locate relevant row\", \"Extract field goal data\", \"Compare with claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that the player 'cole' has the field goal values of '6 - 19 316'.\n\n2. Find the row in the table for the player 'cole': To do this, compare the first column values (the 'player' values) with the claim's subject ('cole'). In our table, the player 'cole' is found in the 10th row.\n\n3. Extract the field goal data for the player 'cole': Now that we have located the row of the player 'cole', we need to examine its data (values within the square brackets) to check if it matches the claim's field goal values. The field goal data in our table is divided into three parts: 'field goals made', 'field goals attempted', and 'total points from field goals'.\n\n4. Compare the extracted data with the claim's field goal values: Split the claim's field goal value (6-19 316) into the components 'field goals made', 'field goals attempted', and 'total points from field goals' to compare them individually with the table data.\n\n5. Check if each component matches the extracted data:\n   - The claim's 'field goals made' (6) should match the first value in our extracted data (in position 0, the index for the 'field goals made' column). In our case, it does (6 = 6), so we can move to the next component.\n   - The claim's 'field goals attempted' (19) should match the second value in our extracted data (in position 1, the index for the 'field goals attempted' column). In our case, it does not (19 != 50), so the comparison fails here.\n   - The claim's 'total points from field goals' (316) should match the last value in our extracted data (in position 2, the index for the total points column). In our case, it does (316 = 316), so we can move to the next step.\n\nSince not all components matched, the comparison has failed, and the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the row in the table for the player 'cole'\",\n    \"Extract the field goal data for the player 'cole'\",\n    \"Compare the extracted data with the claim's field goal values\",\n    \"Check if each component matches the extracted data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"field goals made\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"field goals attempted\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total points from field goals\" }\n  ]\n}",
