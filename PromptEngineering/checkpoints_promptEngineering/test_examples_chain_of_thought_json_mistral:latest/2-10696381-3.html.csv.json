Extract game results: In each row corresponding to a Patriots game, find the result column to see whether they won or lost and if they scored more or less than 30 points.\n\n4. Identify the highest score: Among all the scores obtained from step 3, identify the maximum score that is less than or equal to 30 (as the claim states \"the second most point score\" implies that we only need to find a score that is not higher than the second-highest).\n\n5. Verify if it's the second most point score: Check if this maximum score found in step 4 is the second highest score in the table.
