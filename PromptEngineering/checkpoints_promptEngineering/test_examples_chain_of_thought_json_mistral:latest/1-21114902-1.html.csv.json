Find the row in the data corresponding to the identified fighter. To do that, iterate through the rows and check the \"fighter\" column for a match with the given name. In this case, the row index would be 19 (0-indexed).\n3. Once we have found the row, look at the column named \"submissions of the night\". This value should indicate whether there was a submission by Matt Wiman that was awarded as the \"submission of the night\". In this case, the value should be 1 if true and 0 otherwise.\n4. Compare the value from step 3 with the expected value in the claim (which is 1).
