The team mentioned in the claim is \"scuderia guastalla\" or \"officine alfieri maserati\", but neither of them appear as entrants for the year 1956. However, we know that Maserati was driven by Umberto Maglioli in 1956 according to the table.\n\n2. Since both \"scuderia guastalla\" and \"officine alfieri maserati\" are variations of the same team (Maserati) for the year 1956, we can infer that if Umberto Maglioli drove for one, he might have driven for the other.\n\n3. We then check for multiple instances of a driver (Umberto Maglioli in this case) driving different cars from the same team (Maserati) in the same year (1956). If we find such an instance, it would support the claim that he drove for both teams.\n\n4. In the table, we find two instances of Umberto Maglioli driving a Maserati car (maserati 250f) in the year 1956 (in rows 6 and 7). However, these instances do not specify the team name as either \"scuderia guastalla\" or \"officine alfieri maserati\".\n\n5.

However, the claim states that Umberto Maglioli was awarded 1 1/3 points in each car, which would sum up to 2 (not 4) points for both cars combined. This seems inconsistent with the data.\n5. Check the \"chassis\" column for both rows. In row 4, it is \"ferrari 625\", and in row 5, it is \"ferrari 555\".

Next, iterate through all the rows for each unique driver to check if any of them have 'chassis' containing the word 'porsche'. This will help us determine if Umberto Maglioli drove a Porsche.\n\n3. If we find a row where both the entrant and chassis satisfy the condition, then it means that Umberto Maglioli drove a Porshe at least once. To check if he drove a Porsche in only 1 of his 8 races, we need to count the total number of races he participated in (which is the number of rows with 'entrant' equal to \"umberto maglioli\") and compare it with the number of times he drove a Porsche.\n\n4.

In step 3, we found two teams (scuderia guastalla and officine alfieri maserati) that used the Maserati 250f. However, we don't see any instance of 'scuderia ferrari' driving a Maserati 250f in this data.\n\n6. Since Umberto Maglioli only raced for 'scuderia ferrari', and he didn't drive the Maserati 250f for them, we can conclude that he drove the Maserati 250f in only one of his 8 races because he never drove it at all.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows with 'maserati 250f' as chassis\",\n    \"Find entrant for each row with 'maserati 250f'\",\n    \"Check if Umberto Maglioli was part of those teams that raced the Maserati 250f\",\n    \"If Umberto Maglioli is not found in the relevant rows, then he drove the Maserati 250f in only one of his races (because he didn't drive it at all)\",\n    ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"entrant\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"entrant\" }\n  ]\n}",
