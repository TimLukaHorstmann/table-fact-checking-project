These columns will be used to compare the dates of episodes with Jessica Ennis as a guest.\n2. Find the row(s) where Jessica Ennis is listed as \"andrew and jacks guest\". In this table, she appears in the third row with the episode number \"05x03\".\n3. Extract the date from the first broadcast column for the row where Jessica Ennis is a guest (row 2). In this case, it's \"4 may 2012\".\n4. Compare the extracted date to the target date given in the claim (\"May 2012\"). Since \"4 May 2012\" falls within \"May 2012\", the claim is true for this episode with Jessica Ennis as a guest.\n5. To ensure I have thoroughly examined the table, also check the remaining rows for guests who might fit the date requirement (if any).
