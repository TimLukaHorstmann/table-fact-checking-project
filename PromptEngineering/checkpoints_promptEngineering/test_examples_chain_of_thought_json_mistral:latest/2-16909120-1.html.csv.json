    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we sort the data based on the \"1st lbsc no\" column in ascending order to easily compare values. The table in its current state is already sorted, so this step does not affect the result.\n\n2. We then search for the row that has a \"lbsc name\" of \"granville\". In this case, the relevant row index is 216 (as per our sorted list).\n\n3. Compare the value at the \"1st lbsc no\" column in the found row with the other values in the table. Since there's no other row with a lower \"1st lbsc no\" and also having a \"lbsc name\" of \"granville\", we can conclude that 217 is indeed the lowest \"1st lbsc no\" for the \"lbsc name\" of \"granville\".\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Sort the data by '1st lbsc no' column\", \"Find the row with 'lbsc name' = 'granville'\", \"Compare the found row's '1st lbsc no' with other rows to check if it is the lowest\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 216, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"}, {\"row_index\": 216, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"}]\n}",
