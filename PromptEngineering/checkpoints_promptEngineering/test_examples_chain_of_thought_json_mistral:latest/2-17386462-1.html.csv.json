The table has 23 rows (excluding headers).\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to \"netherfield\" by checking the \"team\" column and find the value for its \"lost\" column to verify the claim about the most losses.\n\n3. Identify the teams with the most draws and compare their draw counts, which are in the \"drawn\" column.\n\n4.
