Check if the value in the Wimbledon tournament column for the 1995 row is \"a\". If it's \"a\", it means that Leconte was absent from Wimbledon that year, which contradicts the claim.\n5. However, upon closer inspection of the table, we can see that there are some abbreviations used for tournament results. For example, \"lq\" stands for \"lost in qualifying,\" and \"nh\" means \"no happen\" or \"not held.\" If Leconte's result for Wimbledon was recorded as one of these abbreviations instead of \"a,\" it would mean he played but did not make it past the qualifying round, not that he was absent.\n6. Therefore, we need to verify if the value in the Wimbledon tournament column for the 1995 row is one of the abbreviations used in the table (lq or nh). In this case, the value for Wimbledon in the 1995 row is \"a.\"\n7.
