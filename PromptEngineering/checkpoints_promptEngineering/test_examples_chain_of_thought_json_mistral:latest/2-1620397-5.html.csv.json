Since the table does not provide such information, we can't determine the exact number of characters (Doctors or companions) from this data.\n\n2. However, we can still check if there exists an episode with exactly 3 characters based on the 'featuring' column, which lists the characters appearing in each episode. We need to find an episode where the 'featuring' value is a list with 3 unique items.\n\n3. Examining the table, we see that episode \"6eb / c\" has Tegan, Nyssa, and Dalek (though it's not clear if they are all characters or one of them represents a group). However, since Dalek is not explicitly listed as an individual character in any other episode, we can consider this episode as having 3 distinct characters.\n\n4.

In this case, there are 8 episodes.\n2. Identify the number of months represented in the released column. Since there is no gap or overlap in the release dates, we can consider each unique month as a separate occurrence. In this case, there are 7 distinct months (October to July and September). Note that August has only one entry, but since it's a single data point, we still count it as an occurrence.\n3. Calculate the average number of episodes per month by dividing the total number of episodes by the number of unique months. In this case, the average would be 8 / 8 = 1 (since we are counting August twice).\n4. Compare the calculated average with the claim: The release date is on average 1 per month.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the episodes in the table. Each row represents an episode.\n2. Next, we check each episode to determine how many characters it features. We can do this by examining the \"featuring\" column for each row.\n3. Inspecting the data, we observe that some episodes have multiple characters listed (ex: \"tegan , nyssa , dalek\", \"peri , victoria\"), while others have only one character listed (ex: \"peri\").\n4. We then compare every episode with exactly one character in the \"featuring\" column to check if they are unique or not. If they are, it means that the claim is true.\n5. To find out if they are unique, we scan through all the episodes and compare them pair-wise to see if any two episodes have the same single character.\n6. Upon inspection, we find that \"peri\" is the only character appearing in two episodes (\"the guardians of prophecy\" and \"power play\"), so it's not unique.\n7. However, the episode with the title \"the child of seth\" also has \"tegan , nyssa\" listed as characters, which means that when considering only the single characters, \"peri\" is still the only episode featuring a single character.\n8. Therefore, even though there are episodes featuring just one character each, they are not unique since more than one episode features \"peri\". However, this does not contradict the claim because the claim specifically asks about episodes with exactly one character (ignoring multi-character episodes like \"the child of seth\").\n9.

Identify the release dates in the table: First, we need to find the column containing the release dates (4th column) and extract all the values from it. The release dates are stored as strings.\n\n2. Convert the release dates into a format that can be used for calculation: Since the claim involves calculating averages, we first need to convert these string dates into a numerical format that represents the number of months since some reference date (for consistency). For example, we could use January 1st, 2011 as the reference date. However, it's important to note that this conversion requires additional information about leap years and day-of-month details which is not provided in the table.\n\n3. Calculate the number of pairs of release dates: Since the claim involves finding an average, we need at least 2 data points for comparison. In this case, there are 8 series, but only 7 have a pair (except for the first and last rows). So, we will have 4 pairs of release dates to work with.\n\n4. Calculate the difference in months between each pair: Once we have our pairs, we can calculate the difference in months between each pair by subtracting the earlier release date from the later release date for each pair. Again, this requires having a reference date and converting the string dates into numerical format, which was not provided in the table.\n\n5. Calculate the average of the differences: Finally, if we were able to calculate the difference in months between each pair successfully, we can find the average of these differences. If the average is approximately 1 every 2 months, then the claim would be supported.
