Each row represents a different fight, with columns for the outcome (win, loss, or draw), opponent's record, and other details like the venue and date of the fight.\n2. To determine the record of Jeremija Sanders, we need to find all the rows where the opponent's name is \"Jeremija Sanders\".\n3. If the number of wins (W) in these rows is greater than the number of losses (L), then the record is a positive one (e.g., 5-2, 7-3). If the number of wins and losses are equal, then the record is 4-4 or 0-0-4, and if the number of losses exceeds the number of wins, then the record is negative (e.g., 2-5, 1-6).\n4.
