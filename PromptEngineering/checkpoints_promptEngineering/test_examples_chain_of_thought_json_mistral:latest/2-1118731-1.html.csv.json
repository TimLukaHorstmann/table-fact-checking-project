    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The power of the 1972 engine is not given in HP (kw).\n2. Locate the row corresponding to the 1972 data in the table based on the \"years\" column. In this case, it's the third row since the value for years is \"1972\".\n3. Verify if there's a value for power (HP) in the identified row. In the third row, the value under the \"power\" column is \"-\", which suggests that there's no specific HP value provided for the 1972 engine.\n4. Since the claim states that the power of the 1972 engine should not be given in HP (kw), and our observation from step 3 indicates that the power is indeed not given in HP, the claim can be considered TRUE.\n\nHere's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim to verify\",\n    \"Locate the row corresponding to the 1972 data based on the 'years' column\",\n    \"Verify if there's a value for power (HP) in the identified row\",\n    \"Check if the observed power value is different from what is expected in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"power\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
