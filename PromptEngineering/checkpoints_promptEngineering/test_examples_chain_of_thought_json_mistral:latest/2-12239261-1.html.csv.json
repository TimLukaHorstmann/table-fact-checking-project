    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. First, identify the series number corresponding to the 1991 season. The table shows the 'season' column where the data type is a string. We need to find the row where the value in the 'season' column matches \"1991\".\n\n2. Second, check if the host of the series was England (column 'host') and whether the series result was drawn (column 'series result').\n\n3. Third, check if West Indies were the holders at the end of the series (column 'holder at the end of the series').\n\n4. Lastly, verify that all the conditions are met for the claim to be true.\n\nNow let's find the row index of the 1991 season:\n- The first row has a 'season' value of \"1\", the second row has a 'season' value of \"1963\". We need to skip these two rows and start looking from row 2 (index 1 in the data array).\n- To find the index of the row for season 1991, we iterate through the data array until we find a row with the 'season' value equal to \"1991\". In this table, there is no row that matches the condition. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row containing the season 1991\",\n    \"Check if England was the host and the series result was drawn for this row\",\n    \"Verify that West Indies were the holders at the end of the series for this row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"host\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"holder at the end of the series\" }\n  ]\n}",
