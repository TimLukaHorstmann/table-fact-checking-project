Check the duration column for this row. The value in the 'duration' column for the third row is '02x03 - 03x05'.\n\n4. Compare the provided claim with the found duration.

Identify the character whose duration for the specified episode range (02x03 - 03x05) is to be checked. In this case, it's Max Martini who plays the role of \"dea agent\".\n\n2. Find the row in the table that corresponds to Max Martini's character information.\n\n3. Check if there is any data available in the column named \"duration\" for the identified row. If yes, then compare it with the specified episode range (02x03 - 03x05).\n\n4. If the duration matches or overlaps with the specified episode range, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let's verify the data:\n\n- In the table provided, there are 41 rows of character information.\n- The relevant row (for Max Martini) has a row_index of 13.\n- The column name for \"duration\" is the fourth column in the \"columns\" array. Its index is 3.\n- Checking that row, we find that the value for the fourth column is \"big brother\", which does not contain any episode range information. This means the duration of 02x03 - 03x05 be list for Max Martini is NOT provided in the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the character whose duration for specified episodes (02x03 - 03x05) is to be checked.\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to the identified character.\",\n    \"Check if there is any data available in the 'duration' column for the identified row.\",\n    \"Compare the duration with the specified episode range (02x03 - 03x05).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
