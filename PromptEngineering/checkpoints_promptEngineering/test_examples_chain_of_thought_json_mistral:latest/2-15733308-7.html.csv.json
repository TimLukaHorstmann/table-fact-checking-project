Compare the rank specified in the claim with the rank found in the relevant row: In the relevant row, the \"rank\" is 47 which is less than 71.\n4. Determine if the year mentioned in the claim is later than the year found in the relevant row: In this case, we need to check if any year after 2005 is associated with the title \"total forest area\".
