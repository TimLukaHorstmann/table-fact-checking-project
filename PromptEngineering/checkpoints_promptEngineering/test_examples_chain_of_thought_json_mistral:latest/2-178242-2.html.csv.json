The columns are \"season\", \"year\", \"mole\", \"winner\", \"runner - up\", \"total prize money\", \"potential prize money\", and \"destination\".\n\n2. Understand the claim being made, which is that \"season 1 of the mole accumulated the highest total prize money at 115000\". To verify this claim, we need to compare the 'total prize money' for each season.\n\n3. Iterate through the data in the table and compare the values in the 'total prize money' column for each row.\n\n4. Find the first row (index 0) with a value of 1 for the 'season' column, which corresponds to Season 1. The total prize money for this season is 115000.\n\n5. Iterate through the rest of the data rows, comparing the 'total prize money' values for each season. If no other row has a value greater than 115000, then it means Season 1 has the highest total prize money.\n\n6. After checking all rows, we find that none have a higher total prize money, so the claim is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names to understand the data\", \"Understand the claim to be checked\", \"Iterate through the data comparing 'total prize money' values for each season\", \"Find Season 1 and compare with other seasons\", \"No higher total prize money found, so the claim is correct\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total prize money\"}]\n}",
