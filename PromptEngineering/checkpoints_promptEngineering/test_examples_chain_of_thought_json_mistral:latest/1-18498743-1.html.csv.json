This helps to identify the relevant rows for comparison. In this case, Slovakia is in row 13 and Mexico is in row 0.\n2. Check the column names for \"love never dies\" and \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\". These columns are used to compare the corresponding values in each row. The relevant columns for these words can be found in rows 13 and 0 respectively, with their respective column names as \"love never dies\" and \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\".\n3. Compare the dates specified in the claim (October 20, 2008 and September 25, 2009) with the dates listed in the table for each row. In this case, the relevant dates are found at rows 0 and 13.\n4. Check if the values from steps 2 and 3 match the given criteria:\n   - Does the \"love never dies\" column value match between Slovakia (row 13) and Mexico (row 0)? No, they do not match.\n   - Does the date value for October 20, 2008 match with the date value for any other row except Mexico (row 0)? Yes, it matches with Macedonia (row 9), but we are comparing Slovakia and Mexico in this case.\n   - Does the September 25, 2009 date value match between Slovakia (row 13) and Mexico (row 0)? No, they do not match.\n5. Finally, compare the entire row data to see if there is any other matching set of values.
