Identify the couple in question from the table: The couple's name should be present in the first column of the data array (since it is labeled as \"couple\"). The couple in question is \"stig & alexandra\".\n\n2. Check if there is any row in the table that matches the identified couple: Loop through each row in the data array and check if the first cell of the current row equals the couple's name we identified earlier (i.e., \"stig & alexandra\"). If it does, then proceed to the next step; otherwise, return FALSE as the final answer since the couple is not present in the table.\n\n3. Once a match is found, find the column index of the music for that row: Since the music is the third column in the data array (index 2), we can now access the value at the third cell of the matched row.\n\n4. Compare the music of the matched couple with the given song: Check if the value found in step 3 matches the given song, \"murder on the dance floor\".
