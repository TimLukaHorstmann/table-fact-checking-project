Since we are only interested in the index, not the actual enrollment numbers or schools themselves, we don't need to perform a strict comparison of the enrollments here. Instead, we can compare the indices of the schools before and after the Newark, DE school while sorting by enrollment size.\n6. In our sorted list, the first school after the Newark, DE school is the fourth row (index 3), which corresponds to the \"university of rhode island\".\n7. Since we are asked to find whether the school with the lowest enrollment comes after the university of Delaware and not if it is the university of Rhode Island, we will check if there's another school with a lower enrollment after the University of Rhode Island.\n8. In our sorted list, there are no more schools coming after the University of Rhode Island. So, there's no need to compare with subsequent rows.\n9. Since there's no other school with a lower enrollment after the university of Rhode Island, the claim is FALSE because the university of Rhode Island does not come after the school located in Newark, DE, but it has a higher enrollment than the one that comes after it (if such a school existed).\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify schools in table\",\n    \"Sort by enrollment size\",\n    \"Find index of Newark, DE school\",\n    \"Compare the indices of schools before and after Newark, DE school while sorting by enrollment size\",\n    \"Check if there's another school with a lower enrollment after the University of Rhode Island\",\n    \"If no such school exists, conclude that the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
