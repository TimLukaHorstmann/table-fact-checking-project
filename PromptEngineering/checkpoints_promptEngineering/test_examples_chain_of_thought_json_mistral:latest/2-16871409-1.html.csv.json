    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning process:\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The lead is Zang Jialiang, and an alternate is Li Dongyan at the 2008 wmcc (World Men's Curling Championship).\n2. Review the table structure: The table contains data about different seasons of curling events with each row representing a specific season. Columns include \"season\", \"skip\", \"third\", \"second\", \"lead\", \"alternate\", and \"events\".\n3. Examine the relevant columns to find matching rows for the 2008 wmcc event: According to the table, the World Men's Curling Championship (wmcc) was held in both 2008 and 2009. However, since the claim mentions 2008 wmcc, we focus on rows with \"events\" equal to \"2008 wmcc\".\n4. Check the \"lead\" column for Zang Jialiang in the matching row: The 2008 wmcc event is represented by the fourth row of the data array, and the value under the \"lead\" column for that row is Wang Fengchun (index 3). Since Zang Jialiang is not present in this row, the claim does not hold true at this stage.\n5. Check the \"alternate\" column for Li Dongyan in the matching row: The value under the \"alternate\" column for the 2008 wmcc event (fourth row) is li dongyan. Thus, the claim partially holds true as Li Dongyan was indeed an alternate at the 2008 wmcc.\n6. Combine all findings to formulate the final answer: Since the lead mentioned in the claim does not match the actual lead for the 2008 wmcc event, the claim is FALSE with respect to the \"lead\" requirement. However, Li Dongyan was an alternate at the event, so the claim partially holds true regarding the \"alternate\" requirement.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Review table structure\",\n    \"Find relevant rows for the specified event\",\n    \"Check 'lead' column for the mentioned player\",\n    \"Check 'alternate' column for the mentioned player\",\n    \"Formulate final answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lead\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"alternate\" }\n  ]\n}",
