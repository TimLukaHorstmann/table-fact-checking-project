Identify the claim: The claim is that games in the middle of the day (12:00 PM) have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening, excluding the Florida game.\n\n2.

Prepare the data for comparison: The Florida game is in the late afternoon, so we will compare only the games from the first six rows (with a time of 12:00 PM) against the last two rows (with times other than 12:00 PM).\n\n4. Compare and analyze the data: For each pair of corresponding attendance values, if the afternoon game's attendance is greater than or equal to the non-afternoon game's attendance, then the claim is false; otherwise, the claim is true. We will perform this comparison row by row and record the relevant cells for later use.\n\n5. Check the results: Based on our analysis, we can see that the afternoons games have lower attendance than the evening/late afternoon game in each case (Indiana State vs Cincinnati, Texas Southern vs Connecticut, and Eastern Kentucky vs Louisville).
