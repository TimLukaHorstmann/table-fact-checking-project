Extract the relevant data from the table: Since we are looking for games against the Atlanta Hawks, we will focus on rows where the \"opponent\" column is equal to \"atlanta hawks\". In this case, there's only one such row with an index of 3.\n3. Check the record: For each game, there is a cell labeled \"record\", which contains the result of the game in a win-loss format. The record for the game against the Atlanta Hawks (row_index=3) is \"107 - 119\" or 1 loss and 6 losses.\n4. Verify the claim: Compare the calculated record from step 3 with the claimed record. The calculated record for games against the Atlanta Hawks is 1 loss and 6 losses, which can be written as 1-6 = -5. However, the claimed record is \"13 - 63\". Since our calculation does not match the claim, the answer is FALSE.\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Extract relevant data\", \"Check the record\", \"Verify the claim\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"}]\n   }",
