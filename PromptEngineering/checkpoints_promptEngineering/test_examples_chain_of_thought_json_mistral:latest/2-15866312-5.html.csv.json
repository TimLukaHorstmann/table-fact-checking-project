We will look for rows where the \"week of\" column matches \"8 may\".\n2. Identify the Tier: The claim refers to Tier 1. We will look for rows where the \"tier\" column matches \"tier i\".\n3. Check if a match is found for the winner: In the data, there are two entries for May 8 in Tier 1. We will check both of them. In the first one, the winner is Conchita Mart\u00ednez (6-3, 6-1). In the second one, Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez and Natasia Zvereva are listed as winners (3-6, 7-6, 6-4), but their names are not separated by a comma which could mean they won together. We will assume that this is a typo or misrepresentation in the table and consider it as a match for our claim.\n4. Check if a match is found for the runner-up: In the first entry, the runner-up is Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario, which does not match Patricia Tarabini as stated in the claim. However, in the second entry, the runner-ups are Conchita Mart\u00ednez and Patricia Tarabini. This is a match for our claim.\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the values in the table that match the claim conditions. The claim states that the week is on the 9th of May, the runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini, and the semi-finalists are Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce.\n\n2. Check if there's any row in the data with the \"week of\" column equal to \"9 may\". The relevant rows from the table are [3] (for Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Martina Hingis), [4] (for Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini), and [6] (for Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario). However, none of these rows meet all the conditions.\n\n3. Next, since the table has multiple entries for each day (one for each tournament tier), we need to look through every row where the runner-up matches the given condition and find if there's a matching semi-finalist pair. In this case, we only have one potential match: row 8 where the runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini and the semi-finalists are Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce.\n\n4. Check if the winner in that row matches the given condition (winner be Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Nat\u00e1lia Zvereva 3 - 6, 7 - 6, 6 - 4). In this case, the winner is indeed Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini, which does not match the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify values matching the claim conditions in the table.\", \"Check if there's a row with 'week of' equal to '9 may'.\", \"If no match found, look for rows where runner-up matches the given condition and find matching semi-finalists.\", \"For each potential match, check if winner also matches the given condition.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week of\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\" }\n  ]\n}",

Specifically, there are entries for \"22 may\", \"15 may 2 weeks\", and \"29 may 2 weeks\" which are all within a week of \"22 may\".\n3. Identify the column names that contain the winner information: The columns \"winner\" and \"runner - up\" contain the results of each match, with the winner's name listed first.\n4.
