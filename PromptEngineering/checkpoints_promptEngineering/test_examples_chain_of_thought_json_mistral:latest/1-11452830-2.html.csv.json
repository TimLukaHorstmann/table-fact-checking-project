Identify the team whose home stadium we are looking for: In this case, it's the team whose record is 1 - 3, which is the team playing at Tampa Stadium from rows [1] to [4].\n\n2. Check the game sites for these four games: The game sites are in column \"game site\". For rows [1] to [4], the game sites are [\"Tampa Stadium\", \"Tampa Stadium\", \"Tampa Stadium\", \"Tampa Stadium\"]. Since all four games were played at Tampa Stadium, we have found the home stadium for the team with a record of 1 - 3.\n\n3. Find the losing game against the New Orleans Saints: We now need to find a row where the opponent is \"New Orleans saints\" and the result has an 'L' (loss). We can see that in row [4], the opponent is \"new orleans saints\" and the result is \"l 13 - 9\". Since this game resulted in a loss, we have found the relevant losing game against the New Orleans Saints.\n\n4. Verify if this game took place at Tampa Stadium: We already established that the game was played at Tampa Stadium since all games from rows [1] to [4] were played there. Since this is the same stadium where the team has a record of 1 - 3, our claim is validated.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team whose home stadium we are looking for.\",\n    \"Check the game sites for these four games.\",\n    \"Find the losing game against the New Orleans Saints.\",\n    \"Verify if this game took place at Tampa Stadium.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
