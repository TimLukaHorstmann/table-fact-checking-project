    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the structure of the table. The table has 5 columns (\"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", \"date\") and multiple rows representing different football matches.\n2. Next, we need to find out what constitutes a point in this context. Since there are two teams in each match, a win would typically earn a team 3 points (one for the win, one for not losing at home, and one for not losing away). A draw would earn both teams 1 point each.\n3. To answer the claim, we need to find the highest score that can be translated into points based on the above rule.\n4. Inspecting the table, we see that some matches have a \"replay\" in the first column. These are actually re-matches of draws or ties, and not new games with different results. Ignoring these rows, we are left with 19 unique matches (the others being replays).\n5. For each match, we need to determine the points scored by the home team. If the score is a win for the home team, it would be 3 points; if it's a draw, it would be 1 point.\n6. In this table, only one match (row 5) has a score of \"5 - 1\", which translates to 4 points for the home team (Woking). No other team scored more than 3 points in any game.\n7. Therefore, the most points scored by a team in a single game is 5 (by Woking), and the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand table structure\",\n    \"Define scoring rules for points\",\n    \"Examine each match to find highest score that translates to most points\",\n    \"Ignore 'replay' rows as they are re-matches\",\n    \"Determine points scored by the home team in each match\",\n    \"Find the highest points scored by a single team\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the rows where the value in the 'tie no' column is 'replay'. These are the games that had a replay.\n2. Next, for each of these 'replay' rows, we will check which team scored the goal (home or away). This information can be found in the 'score' column. The format is home_team - away_team, where the team before the dash is the home team and the one after is the away team.\n3. After that, for each game with a replay, we will check whether the goal difference (home_goals - away_goals) is positive or negative. If it's positive, the home team scored more goals, if it's negative, the away team scored more goals. If it's zero, then the teams tied in the replay game.\n4. Finally, we will compare the number of games where the away team won (i.e., goal difference is negative) with the number of games where the home team won (goal difference is positive or equal to zero). If the number of away wins is greater than the number of home wins, then the claim \"the majority of replay game be win by the away team\" is true. If not, it's false.\n\nNow, let's check the data:\n\n1. Find all 'replay' rows: [5], [8], [12], [14], [16], [17], [19]\n2. Check the goal difference for each replay game: [-1 (wycombe wanderers vs Peterborough United), -1 (Peterborough United vs wycombe wanderers), 0 (Fulham vs Cambridge United), 0 (Cambridge United vs Fulham), -1 (Barrow vs Whitley Bay), -1 (Tranmere Rovers vs Scunthorpe United), 0 (Rotherham United vs Halifax Town), -2 (Halifax Town vs Rotherham United)]\n3. Count the number of away wins: 4\n4. Check if this is greater than the number of home wins (which, in our example, doesn't occur because there are no instances where the goal difference is positive or equal to zero): false\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find all 'replay' rows\", \"Check the goal difference for each replay game\", \"Count the number of away wins\", \"Compare the number of away wins with the number of home wins\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, ...]\n}\n```",

However, since we are only looking for the highest scoring shutout game for \"chester city\", we don't need to consider this second game.\n\nSince there is another game (row 2) labeled as a shutout game where one team scored more goals than \"chester city\" did against \"leek town\", it means that \"chester city\" did not play the highest scoring shutout game.
