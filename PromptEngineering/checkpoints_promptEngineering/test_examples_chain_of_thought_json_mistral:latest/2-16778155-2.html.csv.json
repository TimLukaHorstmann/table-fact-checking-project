Compare attendance values: Examine the 'attendance' column for each of the selected rows. The attendance value for week 8 (row 7) is 61603.\n5. Find the minimum attendance value in the selected rows: Among the filtered rows, find the row with the smallest 'attendance' value. This will be the lowest attendance during the first 10 weeks.\n6.
