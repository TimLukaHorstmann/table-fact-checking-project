The team names are given under the \"opponent\" column, and the Blue Bombers are not present. However, the team name \"Winnipeg Blue Bombers\" is used in this league, so it is important to note that the actual team name might be misspelled or incorrectly capitalized.\n\n2. Since the team named \"Blue Bombers\" does not appear in the table, we cannot confirm whether they defeated the Edmonton Eskimos at home a week prior. Therefore, we can only determine if there's any match between the Edmonton Eskimos and another team that matches the claim's score and location conditions.\n\n3. Check for any game where the \"opponent\" is the Edmonton Eskimos (since the Blue Bombers are not present) and there was a win at home with a score of 30 - 23. No such game exists in the table.\n\n4. Check if there's any game where the \"opponent\" is the Edmonton Eskimos, and there was a loss on the road with a score of 36 - 22. The closest match is the row with the index 14, which has an opponent of \"edmonton eskimos,\" a result of \"loss\", and a score of \"36 - 22.\" However, this game does not meet the condition of being a week prior to another game where they won at home against the Edmonton Eskimos.\n\n5.
