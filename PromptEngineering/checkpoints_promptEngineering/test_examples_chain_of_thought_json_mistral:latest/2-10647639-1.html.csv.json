In this case, it's not explicitly mentioned, but since the data provided refers to a football team playing home games at Sullivan Stadium, we can infer that the team in question is the Patriots (since the New England Patriots are the only NFL team that historically played at Sullivan Stadium).\n\n2. Iterate through each row of the table to find the rows where the \"game site\" column matches \"sullivan stadium\". This will help us determine how many games the team played at home and what their record was in those games.\n\n3. Count the number of wins and losses for the team at Sullivan Stadium to compute their record. Since the win-loss records are represented as a string in the format \"w X - Y\", we'll extract only the number before the dash (X) to get the number of wins, and subtract it from the total number of games played at home to get the number of losses (Y).\n\n4. Compare the computed record with the claim. The claim is that the Patriots have a 7-1 record at Sullivan Stadium, so we should find that the counted number of wins for the team at Sullivan Stadium is 7 and the number of losses is 1.\n\nAfter following these steps, here's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team playing at Sullivan Stadium (Patriots), find rows where 'game site' = 'sullivan stadium', count wins and losses, compare with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}",
