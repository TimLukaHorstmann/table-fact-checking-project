Next, we look for the relevant condition in the table: \"score be 0 - 3 when set 3 be 26 - 28\". This means we need to find a row where the score is between 0 and 3 (inclusive) and the set 3 value is exactly \"26 - 28\" (note that this can be broken down into two separate conditions: score <= 3 AND set 3 == \"26 - 28\").\n\n3. Now, we go through each row in the table and check if it satisfies the given condition. We compare the 'score' column value with the condition 0 <= score <= 3 and the 'set 3' column value with the condition set 3 == \"26 - 28\".\n\n4. By examining the data, we find that the second row matches both conditions: score = \"0 - 3\" (which can be broken down to score[0] <= 3 and score[1] == 0) and set 3 = \"26 - 28\" (which can be broken down to data[4][5] == \"26\" and data[5][5] == \"28\").\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe final JSON object is as follows:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand table structure, Look for relevant condition, Go through each row to check conditions, Find the matching row and compare values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" }, { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"set 3\" } ]\n}",

Iterate through each row (matching each date) in the data section to find the scores for all sets.\n3. Convert each set score into an integer by removing any non-numeric characters and spaces.\n4. Calculate the total score for each set by summing the individual game scores within that set.\n5. Compare the total scores of `set 1`, `set 2`, and `set 3` for each date to find out which set has the highest total.\n\nAfter following these steps, I can determine the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify columns relevant for calculating set totals\",\n    \"Iterate through rows (matches by date) to find game scores for all sets\",\n    \"Convert each set score into an integer by removing any non-numeric characters and spaces\",\n    \"Calculate the total score for each set by summing individual game scores within that set\",\n    \"Compare the total scores of 'set 1', 'set 2', and 'set 3' for each date to find which set has the highest total\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"set 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"set 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"set 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"set 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"set 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"set 1\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this table, no set has the highest total. Each set's total varies across different dates.
