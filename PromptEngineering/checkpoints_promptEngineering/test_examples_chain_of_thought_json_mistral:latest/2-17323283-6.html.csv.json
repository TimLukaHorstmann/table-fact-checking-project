We can find the team names in the first row of the table (index 0) and check for the one that matches \"philadelphia flyers\".\n2. In the second row of the table (index 1), we will find the record for the Philadelphia Flyers. The fourth column, 'record', holds this information.\n3. Compare the value in the 'record' column for the row containing the Philadelphia Flyers to the given claim. The value in the 'record' column should be \"40 - 11 - 10\" for the claim to be true.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team by checking the first row of the table, then find its record in the second row and fourth column.\", \"Compare the value from the table to the given claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"}]\n}",
