First, we need to understand the structure of the table: it has six columns (rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total) and 25 rows (excluding the 'total' row). Each row represents a different nation and their medal count in the respective categories (gold, silver, bronze).\n2. The claim is about Turkey, so we need to find the row related to Turkey in the table. We can do this by looking for the \"nation\" column where the value is \"turkey\". In this case, it's the 10th row.\n3. If the silver column for Turkey (row_index=10) has a value greater than 0 and the gold and bronze columns have values of 0, then the claim would be TRUE.\n4. We can verify this by checking the values in the respective cells:\n   - For row_index=10, column_name=\"silver\": 1 (has a silver medal)\n   - For row_index=10, column_name=\"gold\": 0 (no gold medal)\n   - For row_index=10, column_name=\"bronze\": 0 (no bronze medal)\n5. Since the values for gold and bronze are 0 and the silver value is greater than 0, it means Turkey has a silver medal but no other medal type.
