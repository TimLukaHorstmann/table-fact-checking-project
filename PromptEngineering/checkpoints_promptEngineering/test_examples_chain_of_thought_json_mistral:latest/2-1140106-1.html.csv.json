    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason through this claim:\n\n1. Identify the question: The question asks whether Jack Brabham won half of the races in the 1960 Formula 1 season.\n\n2. Count the total number of races: To determine if Jack Brabham won half, we first need to know how many races were held in the 1960 F1 season. We do this by counting the number of rows in the 'data' section of the table.\n\n3. Count the number of races won by Jack Brabham: Next, for each row, check if the \"winning driver\" column is equal to \"Jack Brabham\". If it is, increment a counter.\n\n4. Calculate whether Jack Brabham won half of the races: If the count from step 3 is greater than or equal to half the total number of races counted in step 2, then the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\n   Now let's calculate based on the table:\n\n   - Step 1 & 2: There are a total of 10 rows in the 'data' section, meaning there were 10 races in the 1960 F1 season.\n\n   - Step 3: Counting the number of times \"Jack Brabham\" appears in the \"winning driver\" column gives us 5 occurrences (Races 2, 4, 6, 7, and 10).\n\n   - Step 4: Since 5 is greater than or equal to half of 10 (i.e., 5 >= 5/2), the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify question: Whether Jack Brabham won half of the races in the 1960 Formula 1 season\",\n    \"Count total number of races (10)\",\n    \"Count races won by Jack Brabham (5)\",\n    \"Calculate whether he won half (true, since 5 >= 5/2)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
