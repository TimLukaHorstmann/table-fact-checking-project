Find the row corresponding to Nov 26: To find this, we need to compare the given date (Nov 26) with the \"date\" column in the table data. We can see that the row with the index 12 meets this condition (\"sun nov 26\" is in the \"date\" column of this row).\n\n3. Check the record and result: In the identified row, we find the \"record\" value as \"6 - 6\" and the \"result\" as \"w 34 - 14\". Comparing these values with the claim, they match exactly with what is specified in the claim (6 - 6 for the record and w 34 - 14 for the result).\n\n4.

In the given table, row 6 (index 5) has a record of \"3 - 4\". This team is the Cleveland Browns.\n2. Find out when the game with the New England Patriots took place. The relevant rows are those with the opponent being the New England Patriots. In the given table, there is only one such row (row 16, index 14). The date of this game is \"sun dec 24\".\n3. Compare the week and date of the game with the New England Patriots to the game that the team with a record of 3 - 4 played after this game. To find the game that was played after the game with the New England Patriots, we need to compare the weeks and dates of all the games after row 16 (index 14) in the table data. The next game for the team with a record of 3 - 4 is in row 15 (index 13), which took place on \"sun dec 17\".\n4. Comparing weeks: Since week numbers start from 1, we can see that the game with the New England Patriots happened in week 16, and the next game for the team with a record of 3 - 4 is in week 15. Therefore, the week number does not match.\n5. Comparing dates: The game with the New England Patriots was played on \"sun dec 24\", which is later than the date of the next game for the team with a record of 3 - 4, which was played on \"sun dec 17\".
