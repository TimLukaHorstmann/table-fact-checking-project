In the given table, it is the fourth column (index 3) labeled as \"ascent time\".\n2. Next, determine the fastest times in the table. To do this, we need to convert the string representation of time (e.g., \"41:55\") into a format that can be compared numerically (e.g., minutes and seconds). We can split each string by ':' and then multiply the hours by 60 and add the remaining minutes and seconds to get a total in seconds. For example, \"41:55\" would become 41 * 60 + 55 = 2715.\n3. After finding the fastest times, count how many of these occur in the year 2000. Compare each time with those labeled as 2000 and check if they are faster or not.\n4. Finally, compare the number of fastests times that occurred in 2000 to the total number of fastest times.
