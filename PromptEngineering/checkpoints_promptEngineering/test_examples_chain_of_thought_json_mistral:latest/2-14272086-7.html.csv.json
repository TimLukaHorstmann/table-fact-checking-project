Check for the number of games: After finding a 4-game sequence, check if the number of games between each pair of consecutive rows is 1 (indicating a single game).\n\n5. Check for game count beyond the 4-game sequence: If there's a 4-game sequence, make sure that no additional games are found after that, as that would mean the series extends past July 10th.\n\n6.
