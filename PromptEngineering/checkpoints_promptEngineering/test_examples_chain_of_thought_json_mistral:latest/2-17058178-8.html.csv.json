For each row in the data array, determine if it corresponds to game 36 by checking the value in the \"date\" column. If it matches, proceed to step 3; otherwise, move on to the next row.\n3. Extract the value in the \"high rebounds\" column for the row corresponding to game 36. This will give us the number of rebounds for joel przybilla in that game.\n4. Compare the number of rebounds for joel przybilla in game 36 with the number of rebounds for any other player in that same game (game 36).\n5. Since there is no other column named \"player\" in the table, we cannot directly compare joel przybilla's rebound count to another player in game 36. However, since only two players have non-zero values for the \"high rebounds\" column in game 36 (lamarcus aldridge and joel przybilla), it is safe to assume that if joel przybilla has the highest number of rebounds, then he must be the player with the highest number of rebounds in game 36.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify game 36, compare its 'date' with each row's 'date', extract 'high rebounds' value for row corresponding to game 36, compare joel przybilla's rebound count in game 36 with other players' rebound counts in the same game (as there are only two players with non-zero values for 'high rebounds')\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}]\n}",
