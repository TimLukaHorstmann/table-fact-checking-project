The table has a \"data\" array containing rows and each row represents a game with its details. Each row has columns: \"date\", \"opponent\", \"score\", \"loss\", \"attendance\", and \"record\".\n3. Look for a row that matches the date 'April 29'. In this table, the data is in chronological order so we start from the last row and move upwards to find the relevant one.\n4. Compare the value at the 'attendance' column (fifth column) of the found row with the claim's attendance value (49194).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Examine table structure\", \"Find relevant data for April 29\", \"Compare attendance values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}\n```",

Look through the \"data\" array of the table to find the row that corresponds to the date April 29th. The row index can be determined by finding the position of the row containing \"tigers\" as the opponent since there's only one game on that day.\n3. Once we have the row_index, look at the cell with the column name \"Attendance\" in that particular row to get the attendance value for April 29th.\n4. Compare the obtained value with the given threshold (49194). If it is less than the threshold, then the claim is true; otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nNow, here's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify date: April 29\",\n    \"Find row with opponent: Tigers\",\n    \"Get attendance value from the 'Attendance' column of the found row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 48, // index of the row containing April 29th (tigers game)\n      \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
