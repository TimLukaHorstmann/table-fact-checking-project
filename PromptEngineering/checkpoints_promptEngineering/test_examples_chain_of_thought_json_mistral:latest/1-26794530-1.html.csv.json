Compare this maximum value with 1 to determine if it is greater than or equal to 1.\n4. If the maximum value is greater than or equal to 1, then the claim is FALSE, since there is at least one series with more poles than 1.\n5. If the maximum value is less than 1, then the claim is TRUE, since no series has more than 1 pole.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum value in the \"poles\" column and compare it with 1:\n- First, calculate the maximum value in the \"poles\" column using the built-in max() function on JavaScript objects (or equivalent functions in other languages).

Compare the values found in step 2 for the \"f/laps\" column (which represents the number of fast laps set by Fortec Motorsport) to determine if they match the value given in the claim (2).
