    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to understand what the table represents. From the column names, it appears to be football standings data for six teams (positions 1-6), with columns for matches played (\"matches\"), wins (\"wins\"), losses (\"loses\"), results of each match, points accumulated, and goal difference (\"diff\").\n2. The claim states that every position wins 2 points for winning a match from 0 up to 10. To verify this, we need to find if the number of points is indeed 2 for each win in the table.\n3. Let's iterate through the data and check the \"wins\" and \"points\" columns:\n   - For row 1 (position 1), if position 1 has 5 wins and 10 points, it means that winning a match awards 2 points (since 5*2=10).\n   - Similarly, for rows 2, 3, and 4, the \"wins\" and \"points\" columns match as well.\n   - For row 5 (position 5), if position 5 has 1 win and 2 points, it seems to contradict the claim, but we can't definitively say since there are only 6 rows in the table.\n   - Row 6 does not have any wins, so it doesn't apply to our analysis.\n4. Since all the wins in the first four positions correspond to points that match the claim (i.e., 2 points per win), we can tentatively say that the claim seems true for positions 1-4.

Verify if the position with value 5 has lost every match. To do this, find the corresponding losses value for position 5 in the table and check if it's greater than or equal to 5 (as there are six total matches).\n\nAfter analyzing the table data, the final answer will be returned in a JSON object with the required format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extract position values from table data\",\n    \"Verify if position 1 has lost 4 matches (by comparing wins and loses values)\",\n    \"Verify if position 5 has lost every match (by checking the losses value for position 5)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"loses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"loses\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
