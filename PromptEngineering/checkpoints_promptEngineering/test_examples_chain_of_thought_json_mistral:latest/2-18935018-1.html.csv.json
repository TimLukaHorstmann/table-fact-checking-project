However, since all schools have different counties, it doesn't help us answer the claim.\n4. Since the location and county didn't provide a clear answer, let's look at the primary conference column. Check if the primary conference of the identified school (\"indian creek\") matches any other school's primary conference (in this case, \"mid - hoosier\"). There are multiple schools with the same primary conference as \"indian creek\".\n5. However, we need to find out if there's a difference in the location among these schools with the same primary conference. In our table, only two schools (\"indian creek\" and \"north decatur\") have their primary conference as \"mid - hoosier\" but different locations (trafalgar and greensburg).\n6.
