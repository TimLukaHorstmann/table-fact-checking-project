Examine the table structure: The table has five columns (\"species\", \"indole\", \"methyl red\", \"voges - proskauer\", \"citrate\") and seven rows (each row representing a different species).\n3. Identify relevant columns: For the claim, we are interested in the \"indole\" and \"methyl red\" columns as they contain the test results for indol and methyl red respectively.\n4. Iterate through the data: Compare each species that tests positive for indol (by checking the 'indole' column) with its corresponding methyl red result (in the 'methyl red' column).\n5. Verify if all positive indol species have a positive methyl red reading: If every species that tested positive for indol also tests positive on the methyl red test, then the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim, examine table structure, identify relevant columns, iterate through data, verify if all positive indol species have a positive methyl red reading\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"indole\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"methyl red\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"indole\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"methyl red\"\n    },\n    // ... continue for all rows in the data array\n  ]\n}",
