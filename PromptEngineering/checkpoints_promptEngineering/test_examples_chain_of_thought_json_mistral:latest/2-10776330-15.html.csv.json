Extract the venues from the table: From the data column, we can see that the venues for each game are 'glenferrie oval', 'windy hill', 'victoria park', 'princes park', 'junction oval' and 'punt road oval'.\n\n3. Filter the venues based on the date: The claim specifies that the venue should have been used on 5 august 1961. We will compare each venue in our list with the \"date\" column to check if they occurred on the same day.\n\n4. Check for matches: If any of the venues match with a game on the date specified (5 august 1961), then it means that the claim is true, and 'victoria park' is indeed one of the 6 venues used on that date.\n\n5. Final answer: Based on our comparison, we can see that 'victoria park' appears in the data (row index 2), which matches the specified date (5 august 1961).
