If any row matches all three conditions (year = 2012, nominated work = \"evita\", award is either \"tony award\" or \"drama desk award\"), then it's true that evita was nominated for a tony award and a drama desk award in 2012.\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we check the table for a row where the 'year' column contains the value 2012. This will help us find the nominated works from that year.\n2. Next, we look at the 'nominated work' column for the rows found in step 1 to determine which shows were nominated for an award that year.\n3. Then, we check if any of the nominated works from step 2 are for the category \"outstanding featured actor in a musical\". We will do this by looking at the 'category', 'nominated work', and 'result' columns to find rows where the 'category' is \"outstanding actor in a musical\" and the 'result' is \"nominated\".\n4. If we find any such rows, it means the claim \"in 2012 evita was nominated for outstanding featured actor in a musical\" is TRUE, since one of the nominated works is 'evita'.\n5. However, if we don't find any rows where the 'nominated work' is 'evita' and the criteria from step 3 are met, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n1. We find a row with the year 2012: [2012, \"tony award\", \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical\", \"evita\", \"nominated\"]\n2. This nominated work is 'evita'.\n3. Next, we search for rows where the 'nominated work' is 'evita', and the criteria from step 3 are met: [2012, \"drama desk award\", \"outstanding featured actor in a musical\", \"evita\", \"nominated\"], which matches perfectly with our criteria.\n4. Thus, the claim \"in 2012 evita was nominated for outstanding featured actor in a musical\" is TRUE.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if there is any row with 'year' equal to 2012.\",\n    \"Identify the nominated works from the row found in step 1.\",\n    \"Look for rows where the 'nominated work' matches with one of the shows from step 2, and also meets the conditions 'category' = 'outstanding actor in a musical' and 'result' = 'nominated'.\",\n    \"If such rows are found, then the claim is TRUE.

Identify the claim to be verified: The claim is that \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.\n\n2.
