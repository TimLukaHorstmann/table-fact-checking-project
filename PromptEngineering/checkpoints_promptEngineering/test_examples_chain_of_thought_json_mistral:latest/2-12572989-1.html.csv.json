Convert the release dates into a format that can be easily compared, such as YYYY-MM-DD. For \"garou : mark of the wolves\", the date is \"june 30 , 2005\" which can be converted to \"2005-06-30\". For \"the last blade 1 and 2\", the date is \"january 12 , 2006\" which can be converted to \"2006-01-12\".\n\n3. Determine whether the release date of \"garou : mark of the wolves\" is approximately 6 months prior to the release date of \"the last blade 1 and 2\". To do this, we need to find the number of months between the two dates. Since the difference in years (2006-2005 = 1) is greater than 6, we can focus on the month differences.\n\n4. In a non-leap year, six months prior to January would be July. Check if the month of the release date for \"garou : mark of the wolves\" is July or later. If it is, then the claim is false.
