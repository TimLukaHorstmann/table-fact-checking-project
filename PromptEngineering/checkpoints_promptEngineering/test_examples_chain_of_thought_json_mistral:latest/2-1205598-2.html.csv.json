By comparing the relevant cells, Philadelphia has teams introduced as follows:\n- MLB: 2010 (Phillies)\n- NBA: 1963 (76ers), but since we don't have an NBA team for Philadelphia before 1963, it must mean they got their first NBA team in 1963.\n- NFL: Since the table doesn't include an NFL team for Philadelphia, we can assume there isn't one from this data.\n- NHL: The table doesn't include an NHL team for Philadelphia either, so it seems like they don't have a team in that league.\n\nSince the other markets in the table have their teams introduced before 2010 (Phillies), we can conclude that Philadelphia is indeed the most recent market to get a team from all four major leagues according to this data.",
