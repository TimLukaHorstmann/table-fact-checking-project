However, to answer the claim, only the columns \"player\" and \"team\" are required since they contain the player's name and team name respectively.\n\n2. Find the row that matches the given player and team: To find the row that matches Alexis Bwenge as a BC Lion, iterate through each row in the data array (starting from the first row) until we find a row where both the \"player\" value equals \"Alexis Bwenge\" and the \"team\" value equals \"BC Lions\".\n\n3. Verify the pick number: Once we've found the relevant row, check if the value in the \"pick\" column corresponds to 8. If it does, then the claim is true; otherwise, the claim is false.\n\n4.
