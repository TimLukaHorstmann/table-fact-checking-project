Identify the claim: \"jim obradovich pick before round 2 but pick 183, play tight end position\".\n3. Find the row that corresponds to Jim Obradovich in the 'player' column: [7, 158, \"jim obradovich\", \"tight end\", \"usc\"].\n4. Compare the value at 'round' column (7) with the condition in the claim (\"pick before round 2\"). The number 7 is greater than 2, so Jim Obradovich was not picked before round 2 according to the table data.\n5. Since the condition in the claim concerning the round is not met, it is not necessary to check the 'pick' value (183) or any other conditions in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names\", \"Identify the claim\", \"Find Jim Obradovich's row\", \"Compare 'round' value with the condition in the claim\", \"Check if it is necessary to verify other conditions in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n1. Identify the columns in the table: round, pick, player, position, school.\n2. Understand the claim: The claim states that Jim Obradovich was picked after round 2 but before pick 183 and played the tight end position.\n3. Determine the order of picks: To check if Jim Obradovich was picked after round 2, we need to find his row index and compare it with the values in the \"round\" column for all rows (rows have indexes starting from 0).\n4. Locate Jim Obradovich's row: Scroll through the data to find the row where the \"player\" value is \"jim obradovich\". In this case, Jim Obradovich's row is at index 5 (row 6 in the original table).\n5. Check if Jim Obradovich was picked after round 2: Compare the value in the \"round\" column for Jim Obradovich's row (7) with the values in the \"round\" column for all rows before him. In this case, all rows before Jim Obradovich have a smaller value than 7, so he was indeed picked after round 2.\n6. Check if Jim Obradovich plays tight end position: Compare the value in the \"position\" column for Jim Obradovich's row (tight end) with the value \"tight end\". Since they are equal, Jim Obradovich does play the tight end position.\n7. Check if Jim Obradovich was picked before pick 183: Compare the value in Jim Obradovich's \"pick\" column (158) with the values in the \"pick\" column for all rows after him. In this case, there is no row with a larger value than 158, so he was not picked before pick 183.\n8. Combine results: Since Jim Obradovich was indeed picked after round 2 (from step 5) and plays the tight end position (from step 6), but he was not picked before pick 183 (from step 7), the claim is only partially correct. However, since the claim specifies that he should be neither before round 2 nor after pick 183 and play tight end position, it would be more accurate to say the claim is FALSE because it fails one of the conditions specified in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"[1] Identify columns, claim, and data in table.\\n[2] Determine pick order and find player's row.\\n[3] Check if player was picked after round 2.\\n[4] Check if player plays the specified position.\\n[5] Check if player was picked before specified pick number.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }\n  ]\n}",
