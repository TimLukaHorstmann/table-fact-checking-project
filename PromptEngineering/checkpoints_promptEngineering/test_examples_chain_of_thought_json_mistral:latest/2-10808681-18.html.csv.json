For Richmond, the score is 18.9 (117), but this can be converted to a more familiar format by adding the digits after the decimal point and then dividing by 8 (since there are 8 numbers before the decimal point). So, 18 + (9/8) = 20.125, which can be rounded up to 20. The score for South Melbourne is 7.7 (49), which does not need any modification as it is already in the correct format.\n6. Compare the scores obtained from the table with the scores mentioned in the claim.
