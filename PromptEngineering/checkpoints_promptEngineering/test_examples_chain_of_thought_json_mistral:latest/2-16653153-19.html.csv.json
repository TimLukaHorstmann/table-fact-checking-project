Check if there's a row in the table that matches the date specified in the claim (December 4).\n3. Compare the venue column of the matching row with the name given in the claim (North Shore Event Centre).\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's find the relevant cells:\n1. The row corresponding to December 4 is at index 1 since the table starts counting from 0.\n2. The venue column for this row is \"north shore events centre\". This matches with the venue given in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if there's a game played on December 4\",\n    \"Find the venue of the game on that date\",\n    \"Compare the found venue with the one mentioned in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check the date associated with this row, which will give us the date when a game was played at the north shore event centre.\n\nNow let's examine the table data:\n\n- The first and last rows do not match our venue of interest (\"north shore events centre\").\n- The second row has \"north shore events centre\" as its venue, but no corresponding date is provided in the \"date\" column.

If we find a match in step 2, compare the \"venue\" from the matched row with the venue given in the claim (North Shore Events Centre).
