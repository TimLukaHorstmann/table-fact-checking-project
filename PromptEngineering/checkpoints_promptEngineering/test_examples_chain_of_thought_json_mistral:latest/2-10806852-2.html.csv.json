Identify the key information required to verify the claim: The claim is about the match between Hawthorn (home team) and North Melbourne (away team) on April 1939, with a score difference of 17 to 11 in favor of Hawthorn.\n2. Find the row in the table that corresponds to the specified home team and date: In this case, we are looking for the row where \"home team\" is \"hawthorn\" and \"date\" is \"29 april 1939\". The first row matches these criteria.\n3. Check if the score difference is correct: To determine if the score difference is correct, we need to compare the home team score with the away team score for this row. In our matched row, the home team score is \"17.13 (115)\" and the away team score is \"11.11 (77)\". The score difference is indeed 17 (115 - 98 = 17).\n4. Verify that the teams involved are correct: The home team in our matched row is Hawthorn, which matches the claim. The away team in our matched row is North Melbourne, which also matches the claim since there's no mention of a specific opponent for North Melbourne in the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE: \"april 1939 , hawthorn destroyed north melborne , 17 to 11\".\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n  }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key information required\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the specified home team and date\",\n    \"Check if the score difference is correct\",\n    \"Verify that the teams involved are correct\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

If we find a crowd value greater than any other, then it indicates that the corresponding game is the one with the largest crowd in attendance.\n4. Finally, identify the row index of the game that has the maximum crowd.
