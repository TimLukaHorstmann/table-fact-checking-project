    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n   1. Identify the claim: The claim is that \"nailea norvind be the nominee who win for best male villain\".\n   2. Check the table structure: The table contains data about different awards (categories) given in a certain year (ceremony). Each row includes the year, ceremony, category, nominee, and result.\n   3. Search for relevant rows: Since we are looking for the best male villain category, we search through the \"category\" column for any matching value.\n   4. Find the relevant cells: We find one matching cell in the table with the \"category\" equal to \"best male villain\" and the \"nominee\" equal to \"nailea norvind\". However, this row has a \"result\" of \"won\", which is not what we are looking for since the claim states that she should have been a nominee (not won).\n   5. Search again: To find the correct nominee who won in the best male villain category, we search for rows with the \"category\" equal to \"best male villain\" and the \"result\" equal to \"won\".\n   6. Find the relevant cells: We find one matching cell where the \"category\" is \"best male villain\", the \"result\" is \"won\", but the \"nominee\" is \"c\u00e9sar \u00e9vora\". This row does not match the claim.\n   7. Search for nominees: Since we couldn't find a winner who matches the claim, we look for all nominees in the best male villain category to see if any of them won later (as per the claim).\n   8. Find the relevant cells: We find one more row where the \"category\" is \"best male villain\", and it doesn't have a \"result\" of \"won\". This means that the nominee in this row was not the winner but could still be the one who matches the claim.\n   9. Check for other winners: We look through all remaining rows to see if any other nominee in the best male villain category won later, but we don't find any.\n  10.
