Check the data for each team: In our table, only Independiente was a champion in both the Recopa 1994 and the Copa Libertadores 1995 (Recopa 1994 column shows 'champions' and Copa Libertadores 1995 column shows 'round 2', which is not the final). V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield was a runner-up in Recopa 1994 but did not participate in Copa Libertadores 1995 (Recopa 1994 column shows 'runner up' and Copa Libertadores 1995 column is N/A).\n\n4.
