    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the week number of the game when it was played at Soldier Field (Chicago Bears' home field). From the data, we see that there is only one row where the \"game site\" column says \"soldier field\".\n2. Determine the result of the game at that location. In the same row, we find the \"result\" column which indicates the score was \"w 31 - 29\".\n3. Find the week number in which this game was played. From the \"week\" column, we can see that the corresponding row has a \"week\" of 10.\n4. Compare the week number with the given claim's requirement. The claim states that it should be after week 10. In our data, the game was indeed played in week 10.\n5. Since the condition (played at Soldier Field and after week 10) is satisfied for this game, we can conclude that the result of the game played at Soldier Field after week 10 was a win with the score \"w 31 - 29\".\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row where 'game site' is 'soldier field'.\",\n    \"Determine the result of that game (from the 'result' column).\",\n    \"Identify the week number of the game (from the 'week' column).\",\n    \"Compare the week number with the given claim's requirement (played after week 10).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\" }\n  ]\n}",
