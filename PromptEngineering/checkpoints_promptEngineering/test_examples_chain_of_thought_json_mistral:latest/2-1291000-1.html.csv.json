Determine the relevant columns from the table to check if the information about natural wood keyboard exists for the given model. In this case, the relevant column is \"natural wood keyboard\".\n3. Check the data corresponding to the row with the label \"clps306\" in the \"data\" section of the table. The value at the intersection of the row labeled \"clps306\" and the column named \"natural wood keyboard\" is \"no\".\n4. Compare the information found in step 3 with the claim being made: Since the information in the table indicates that \"clps306\" is not a natural wood product (the value is \"no\"), this is consistent with the claim.\n5.
