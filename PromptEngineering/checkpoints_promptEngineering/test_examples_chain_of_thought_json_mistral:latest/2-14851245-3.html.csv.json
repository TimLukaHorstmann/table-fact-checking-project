However, we can assume that the player's name is represented by the first column \"outcome\". Since the player of interest is 'ivana abramovi\u0107', I will filter the data based on this information.\n\n2. Filter the data for the rows where the player's name (the \"outcome\") matches 'ivana abramovi\u0107'. This will give us all the matches related to the player of interest.\n\n3. Examine each row's \"surface\" column to see if it contains 'clay'. If any row has a surface of clay, then the claim is true, and we don't need to check further.\n\n4. Based on the given data:\n   - The first matching row for 'ivana abramovi\u0107' has a surface of 'clay', but it's not on Jul 16, 2007 or Sep 24, 2007. So, we move to the next match.\n   - The second matching row for 'ivana abramovi\u0107' also does not have a date that matches either Jul 16, 2007 or Sep 24, 2007.

Since there's no data on ivana abramovic in this table, we need to consider only rows where maria abramovic is a partner or an opponent.\n2. Filter the data based on the condition that one of the opponents or partners is maria abramovic. This will help us identify all relevant instances where maria abramovic played with another player (either as a partner or an opponent).\n3. Check each row's \"outcome\" column to see if ivana abramovic was involved in any matches with maria abramovic, and if so, what the outcome of those matches were. If every match resulted in a win for ivana abramovic, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n4. Relevant cells will be the ones that have \"ivana abramovic\" or \"maria abramovic\" as an opponent or partner and also contain information about the match outcome.\n\nThe final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify subjects of claim\",\n    \"Filter data for relevant instances with maria abramovic as a partner/opponent\",\n    \"Check each row's 'outcome' column to determine if ivana abramovic won every match against maria abramovic\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    // ...
