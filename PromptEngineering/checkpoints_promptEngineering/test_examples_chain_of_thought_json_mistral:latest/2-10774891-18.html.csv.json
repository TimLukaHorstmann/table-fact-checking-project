    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will check the structure of the table to understand the data it contains. In this case, we have a table with 7 columns (home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date) and 6 rows of data.\n2. Next, I will look for any repeated values in the \"crowd\" column to determine if two games had the same number of attendees.\n3. I observe that there are two instances where the crowd size is exactly 10000. These occur at row indexes 0 and 4.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Examine table structure, find 'crowd' column to check for repeated values, locate instances of 10000 in the crowd column.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n  ]\n}",
