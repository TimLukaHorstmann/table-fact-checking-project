    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim's key details: The claim states that a crowd of 66,189 attended a game where the New Orleans Saints had a record of 6 - 1.\n2. Locate relevant data in the table: To check the attendance and record for the Saints, we need to find the rows corresponding to the games they played. We will also need to verify that the attendance matches the crowd size mentioned in the claim.\n3. Examine the data: Start from the first row and move through the table until we find a game where the opponent is \"New Orleans saints\". We will then check the record (column 'record') for the corresponding game.\n4. Compare findings with the claim: Once we have found the relevant data, compare it with the claim. If the attendance matches 66,189 and the record is 6 - 1, then our analysis supports the truth of the claim. Otherwise, it would suggest that the claim is false.\n\n   Here is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the key details in the claim\",\n    \"Locate relevant data in the table\",\n    \"Examine the data for the game where the opponent is 'New Orleans saints'\",\n    \"Compare findings with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify the week where the record is 6 - 1, since that's the week we're looking for the attendance figure. The team with a record of 6 - 1 can be found in the \"data\" array. In this table, only the 13th row (index 12) meets this condition: opponent column is \"san francisco 49ers\", and the result column is \"10 - 2\".\n\n2. Once we have identified the correct week (week 13), we can now look for the attendance figure for that specific week. In this table, the attendance figures are in the \"attendance\" column of each row. The attendance value for the 13th row (index 12) is 66218.0.\n\n3. Compare the claim's specified attendance with the actual attendance from step 2.
