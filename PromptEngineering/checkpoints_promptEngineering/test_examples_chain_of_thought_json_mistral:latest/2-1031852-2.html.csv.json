    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be tested: The claim is that \"Houston has no post-season record\".\n\n2. Identify the relevant data: To verify this claim, we need to check if there are any rows in the table where the team's 'mlb affiliate' is 'Houston' and the 'post - season record' or 'post - season win %' is not empty (i.e., has a value other than '-').\n\n3. Examine the data: Analyze the 'data' array to find rows with 'mlb affiliate' as 'Houston'. In this table, all the teams are from Houston.\n\n4. Check for non-empty values in relevant columns: For each row corresponding to Houston, check if the 'post - season record' or 'post - season win %' is not empty ('-').\n\n5. Evaluate the findings: If any of the rows have a non-empty value in either 'post - season record' or 'post - season win %', then Houston has a post-season record, and the claim would be FALSE. If all values are empty, then Houston does not have a post-season record, and the claim would be TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim to be tested\",\n    \"Identify the relevant data\",\n    \"Examine the data to check for non-empty values in relevant columns\",\n    \"Evaluate the findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"\n    },\n    ...
