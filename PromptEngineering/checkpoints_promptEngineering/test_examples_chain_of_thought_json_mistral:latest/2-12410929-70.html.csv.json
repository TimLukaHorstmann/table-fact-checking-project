Confirm that these matches are indeed away matches: Since the home captain and venue remain consistent for each row, we can assume that a change in result indicates an away match for Courtney Walsh.\n\n5. Verify if all matches are away matches: After examining the \"result\" column, we observe that the team represented by Courtney Walsh (which appears to be West Indies based on the captain names) loses or faces defeat in every match, suggesting these were indeed away games for them.\n\nWith this reasoning, the final answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim: Courtney Walsh was the away captain for all matches\",\n                       \"Understand table structure: List of columns and rows representing individual matches\",\n                       \"Find related values for Courtney Walsh in 'away captain' column\",\n                       \"Confirm these are away matches by examining 'result' column\",\n                       \"Verify if all matches are away: No home team wins in any match\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"}\n  ]\n}",
