    "resp": "1. First, I identify the table's structure by examining its columns and data. The table consists of five columns: driver, constructor, laps, time/retired, and grid.\n\n2. Next, I focus on the claim that \"cesare perdisa have a time / retire of + 6 lap\". To verify this claim, we need to look at the row in the table that corresponds to cesare perdisa (row index) and check the value in the 'time / retired' column (column name).\n\n3. In the provided data, I find the relevant row for cesare perdisa:\n```\n[\n  \"cesare perdisa\",\n  \"maserati\",\n  95,\n  \"+ 6 laps\",\n  15\n]\n```\nThe fourth element in this row (\"+ 6 laps\") represents the 'time / retired' value for cesare perdisa.\n\n4. Finally, I compare the claim with the actual data from the table. The \"time / retired\" value for cesare perdisa is indeed \"+ 6 laps\", which matches the claim.\n\nBased on my analysis, here is the final answer:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the structure of the table: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, and grid.\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to 'cesare perdisa'.\",\n    \"Check the value in the 'time / retired' column for 'cesare perdisa'.\",\n    \"Compare the claim with the actual data from the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Find all rows in the table where the \"driver\" matches Robert Manzon and the \"constructor\" matches Maserati.\n3. For each row found, get the value of the \"laps\" column to find out how many laps Robert Manzon completed with Maserati (88 in this case).\n4. Find all rows where the \"driver\" is any driver on the grid (i.e., not retired or DNF). This can be done by checking if the value of the \"time / retired\" column is either a time or an empty string, and that it's not \"+ x laps\", which indicates retirement.\n5. For each row found in step 4, get the value of the \"grid\" column to find out the starting position of each driver on the grid.\n6. Calculate the average starting position of all drivers on the grid by summing up their grid positions and dividing the total by the number of drivers on the grid.\n\nNow, let's compare this average grid position with the claim (22).\n\nFinally, format the answer in a valid JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the driver and constructor mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find all rows where the 'driver' matches Robert Manzon and the 'constructor' matches Maserati\",\n    \"For each row found, get the value of the 'laps' column\",\n    \"Find all rows where the 'time / retired' column is either a time or an empty string (not retired)\",\n    \"For each row found in step 4, get the value of the 'grid' column\",\n    \"Calculate the average starting position of all drivers on the grid\",\n    \"Compare this average with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\" },   // First driver's grid position is used as a representative for all drivers on the grid\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" }   // Checking if this row meets condition in step 4 (i.e., not retired)\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the driver whose details we need to verify: In this case, the driver is Cesare Perdisa.\n2. Locate the data row that corresponds to the given driver in the table: To do this, iterate through each row in the \"data\" array and check if the \"driver\" column matches \"cesare perdisa\".\n3. Once we find the matching row for Cesare Perdisa, examine the value of the fourth column (time / retired) to see if it corresponds to \"+ 6 laps\".\n4. Also, verify that the grid position is 18 by checking the fifth column (\"grid\") in the same row for Cesare Perdisa's data.\n\nNow let's check the table:\n\n- First, we find the matching row for Cesare Perdisa. In this case, the row_index = 10.\n- Next, we check the fourth column (time / retired) in that row. Here, it is indeed \"+ 6 laps\".\n- Lastly, we check the fifth column (\"grid\") to ensure it's 18. Again, this matches our requirement as well.\n\nBased on my examination of the table and comparison with the given claim, here's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify driver: cesare perdisa\",\n    \"Locate data row for driver: Iterate through each row and check if 'driver' column equals 'cesare perdisa'\",\n    \"Check 'time / retired' value for the matching row: Ensure it's '+ 6 laps'\",\n    \"Check 'grid' position: Ensure it's 18\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"grid\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
