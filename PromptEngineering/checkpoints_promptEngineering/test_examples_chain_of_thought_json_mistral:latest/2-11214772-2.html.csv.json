    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the champion from the year 2005. The column for the year is at index 0, and the column for \"champion\" is at index 1. We search through the rows until we find a year equal to 2005. In this case, the champion for that year is at row index 1 (as 'elon' in the second row).\n\n2. Next, determine if 'clemson' was the third-place team in the same year. The column for \"runner - up\" is at index 3, but since we are looking for third place and not runner-up, we ignore this step. The semi-finalist columns can potentially be the third-place team. We compare the value of each row (index 2) with 'clemson'. In this case, 'clemson' is at row index 1.\n\n3. Finally, check if the third-place team lost to the champion in the same year. Since we already found that 'clemson' was the semi-finalist (third place) in the year 2005, and there exists a row where both 'champion' (elon) and 'semi - finalist 1' (clemson) belong to the same year, it means that clemson lost to elon (the champion).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the champion of 2005.
