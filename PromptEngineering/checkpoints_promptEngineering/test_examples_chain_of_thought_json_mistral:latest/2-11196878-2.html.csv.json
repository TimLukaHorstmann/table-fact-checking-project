    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify Tony Mendoza's row in the data by searching for his name. In this case, he is located at the 10th row (index 9).\n2. Check the column that corresponds to \"opponent\" to confirm it is indeed Tony Mendoza. The value in the \"opponent\" column of the 10th row is \"tony mendoza\".\n3. Check if there exists a column that indicates the event duration for Tony Mendoza's fight. In this table, the closest match would be the \"time\" column which represents the time it took to finish the opponent during the fight. However, this column's values are in minutes:seconds format, not seconds as required by the claim.\n4. To find the total number of seconds for Tony Mendoza's fight, convert his \"time\" value from minutes:seconds format to seconds. The value 2:41 converts to 171 seconds.\n5. Compare the converted time in seconds (171) with the event duration mentioned in the claim (2:41). Since they are identical, we can conclude that it is the same event duration as given in the claim.\n6. The claim states that Tony Mendoza's opponent lasted for 2:41 in an event. Since the duration of his fight was 171 seconds (which is equivalent to 2 minutes 41 seconds), the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow let me provide the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Tony Mendoza's row\",\n    \"Check if it is indeed Tony Mendoza in the 'opponent' column\",\n    \"Look for a column that indicates the event duration\",\n    \"Convert the time value from minutes:seconds to seconds\",\n    \"Compare the converted time with the claim's event duration\",\n    \"If they match, conclude that the claim is true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify Tony Mendoza's row in the data table by searching for a record where opponent equals \"tony mendoza\". The first row where opponent matches \"tony mendoza\" has an index of 10.\n2. Check the value of the \"event\" column for the same row (row_index = 10) to find out the event in which Tony Mendoza was the opponent. The value is \"wfc : rumble in the rockies\".\n3. Find all events from the data table where the event matches \"wfc : rumble in the rockies\" to narrow down the search for relevant rows. Since there's only one row with this event name, it can be directly compared to Tony Mendoza's row.\n4. Compare the time column of the event row (not found because there's only one event row) to Tony Mendoza's row. The value in the time column for Tony Mendoza's row is \"2:41\".\n5. Determine if the claimed time matches the time found in step 4. In this case, the claimed time (2:49) does not match the actual time (2:41).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Tony Mendoza's row by searching for a record where opponent equals 'tony mendoza'.\",\n    \"Check the value of the event column for the same row to find out the event in which Tony Mendoza was the opponent.\",\n    \"Find all events from the data table where the event matches the found event name.\",\n    \"Compare the time column of the event row to Tony Mendoza's row.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"time\" }\n  ]\n}",
