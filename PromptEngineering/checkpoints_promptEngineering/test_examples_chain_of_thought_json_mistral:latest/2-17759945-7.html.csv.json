Identify the required data: The claim asks for the date of birth of a forward (cf) player born in 1975 who has a height taller than m (ft 4in).\n\n2. Extract the necessary data from the table: Filter the data based on position (\"cf\") and year of birth (1975). Then, filter again to find players with a height taller than m (ft 4in) in the \"height\" column.\n\n3. Check for matching rows: If there are matching rows, then get the date of birth of the player found.\n\n4. Output the answer: If a matching row is found, output the answer as \"TRUE\", providing the relevant cells containing the date of birth and other details of the player.
