    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the condition to check for: The claim states that there should not be a school that has a bask score of 0, an indoor track score of 0, and a swim score of 5.\n\n2. Check each row in the table (data array): For every row, check if the \"bask\" column value is 0, the \"indoor track\" column value is also 0, and the \"swim\" column value is 5.\n\n3. If any of the rows meet the conditions specified above, then we can conclude that the claim is FALSE. If none of the rows meet these conditions, then the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. Iterate through each row in the table and check for the condition:\n\n- First row (Cleveland State): \"bask\" value = 2, not meeting the condition.\n- Second row (Detroit): \"bask\" value = 3, not meeting the condition.\n- Third row (Green Bay): \"bask\" value = 28, not meeting the condition.\n- Fourth row (Milwaukee): \"-\" in \"bask\" column, ignoring this row as it represents no data available.\n- Fifth row (UIC): \"bask\" value = 0, but not meeting the other conditions.\n- Sixth row (Valparaiso): \"bask\" value = 0, not meeting the condition.\n- Seventh row (Wright State): \"-\" in \"bask\" column, ignoring this row as it represents no data available.\n- Eighth row (Youngstown State): \"bask\" value = 2, not meeting the condition.\n\n5. Since none of the rows meet the specified conditions, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the condition to check for\",\n    \"Check each row in the table and see if it meets the specified conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the school in question - The school we are interested in is \"green bay\".\n2. Find the row corresponding to the school - In the data array, find the row that contains the school name \"green bay\". Row index is 2.\n3. Check the columns of interest - For the school \"green bay\", check the values in the columns for swim score, volleyball score, and total score.\n4. Verify the swim score - In the second column (bask), the value at row_index 2 is 28, which is not equal to 9 as stated in the claim. So far, we have found a discrepancy.\n5. Verify the volleyball score - In the eleventh column (volleyball), the value at row_index 2 is 0, which is not equal to 1 as stated in the claim. The discrepancy persists.\n6. Verify the total score - In the last column (total), the value at row_index 2 is 40, which is more than 35. This verifies part of the claim.\n7. Summarize the findings - Since there were discrepancies in swim score and volleyball score but the total score was verified to be greater than 35, the claim is only partially correct. The swim score and volleyball score are incorrect, but \"green bay have a total score of more than 35\" is true.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the school in question\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the school\",\n    \"Check the columns of interest (swim, volleyball, total scores)\",\n    \"Verify the swim score\",\n    \"Verify the volleyball score\",\n    \"Verify the total score\",\n    \"Summarize the findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"PARTLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bask\" }, // swim score for green bay\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"volleyball\" }, // volleyball score for green bay\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\" } // total score for green bay\n  ]\n}",

Examine the table data to find the row that corresponds to \"green bay\". In this case, it's the third row.\n2. Look at the column names to identify which one corresponds to \"volleyball\". In this case, it's the eighth column.\n3. Check the value in the cell where the row for \"green bay\" intersects with the column for \"volleyball\". The value is \"0\".\n4.

The total column at the end represents the sum of all the other columns for that particular row.\n2. Identify the school in question: In this case, the school in question is \"wright state\".\n3.

Determine if there is a swimming competition at wright state: Check the value of the \"swimming\" column for the row with a \"school\" value of \"wright state\".
