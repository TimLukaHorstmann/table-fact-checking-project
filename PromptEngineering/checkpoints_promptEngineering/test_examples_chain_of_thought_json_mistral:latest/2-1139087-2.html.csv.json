Determine the data structure of the table: The table has two main sections - 'columns' and 'data'. The columns section lists all the column headers, while the data section contains arrays with rows of data.\n\n3. Find the relevant columns for this claim: To verify this claim, we need to look at the \"winning driver\" column as it indicates who won each race. In this case, since the claim is about pole position, we also need the \"pole position\" column.\n\n4. Iterate through the data and count the number of times 'ayrton senna' appears in both the \"winning driver\" and \"pole position\" columns: We will compare each row to see if the value under \"winning driver\" is 'ayrton senna' and if the value under \"pole position\" for that same row is also 'ayrton senna'.\n\n5. Compare the count with the total number of races (17) mentioned in the claim: If the count matches 13, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be all the rows where the \"winning driver\" is 'ayrton senna' and the \"pole position\" is also 'ayrton senna'.

    "resp": "Reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Alain Prost won the Italian Grand Prix, despite Michele Alboreto having the fastest lap in that race.\n2. Locate the relevant row in the table: To determine if Alain Prost won the Italian Grand Prix, we need to find the row corresponding to this event in the table. The Italian Grand Prix is listed as the 11th row with a date of \"11 september\".\n3. Check who won the race (winning driver column): In the 11th row, we find that the winning driver was Gerhard Berger, not Alain Prost. This suggests that the claim is false. However, it's important to confirm whether or not Alain Prost had the fastest lap in this race before making a definitive conclusion.\n4. Check who had the fastest lap (fastest lap column): In the 11th row, we find that the driver with the fastest lap was Michele Alboreto, as expected from the claim.\n5. Compare the winner and the one with the fastest lap: Although Michele Alboreto had the fastest lap in the Italian Grand Prix, he did not win the race (Gerhard Berger won).
