Determine the data structure of the table: The table has two main sections, \"columns\" and \"data\", where columns define the headers and data contains the rows with corresponding values.\n3. Loop through each row in the data section: Iterate through every row to check if it contains the team names specified in the claim (in this case, \"chinatrust whales\" and \"kao lung - wei\").\n4. Find the relevant rows: If a row contains both team names, then it is relevant to verify the claim. In this table, there are two such rows with indexes 1 and 2.\n5. Check if the teams actually played against each other in the found rows: Analyze the 'opponent' column of the relevant rows to see if they indeed play against each other. In this case, for both relevant rows, the opponent is \"chinatrust whales\".\n6.

Neither of these rows has this specific value in the \"save\" column.\n3. Lastly, I need to confirm that for the games where Pan Wei - Lun lost (these are the rows where \"loss\" is not null), there is no specific goalkeeper associated with them. This is because the claim states that the loss was by someone who had a save from \"huang chun - chung\", and since there's no such instance in the table, it means that for losses, no specific goalkeeper is mentioned.\n4. Since neither of the games where Pan Wei - Lun played against Chinatrust Whales has a \"save\" column with the value \"huang chun - chung\", and because there are no specific goalkeepers associated with their losses, it can be concluded that Pan Wei - Lun did not lose to someone who had a save of \"huang chun - chung\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify games where both teams are playing against each other\", \"Check if 'save' column has the value 'huang chun - chung'\", \"Confirm that losses do not have specific goalkeepers\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"save\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"save\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"loss\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"loss\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
