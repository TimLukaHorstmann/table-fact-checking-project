    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, identify the columns in the table by looking at the \"columns\" array. We have player, car, yards, avg, and long.\n2. Next, determine the piece of information we need to verify the claim: specifically, whether the number of carries for Dane Krager is 59.\n3. Check the \"player\" column to find Dane Krager's row index (position in the data array). In this case, his row index is 0 since he appears first in the data array.\n4. Look at the second element of the first row of the data array, which corresponds to the \"car\" column. However, since the question doesn't ask about the car, we can ignore this step for now.\n5. Check the third element of the first row of the data array (index 2), which corresponds to the \"yards\" column. The value is 197. This information isn't relevant for our claim either.\n6. Examine the fourth element of the first row of the data array (index 3), which corresponds to the \"avg\" column. The value is 3.3, not what we are looking for. Ignore this information.\n7. Finally, check the fifth element of the first row of the data array (index 4), which corresponds to the \"long\" column. This information isn't relevant for our claim as well.\n8. Look at the first element of the first row of the data array (index 0), which corresponds to the \"player\" column. The value is \"dane krager\". We have confirmed that this is the correct player whose carries we want to check.\n9. Find the sixth element of the first row of the data array (index 5). This is where the number of carries would be if it were included in the table. However, since it isn't included, we can't confirm whether the claim \"dane krager have 59 carry\" is true or false based on this data.\n\nSince we cannot verify the claim with the provided data, we will return an answer that indicates this situation:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify columns in the table\",\n    \"Determine what information needs to be checked (number of carries for Dane Krager)\",\n    \"Find Dane Krager's row index\",\n    \"Check other values in Dane Krager's row to see if they are relevant\",\n    \"Look for number of carries but cannot find it because it is not included in the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INVALID_INPUT\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\" }\n  ]\n}",
