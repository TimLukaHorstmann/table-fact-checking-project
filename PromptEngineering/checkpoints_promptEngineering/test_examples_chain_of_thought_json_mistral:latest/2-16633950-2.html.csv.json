Determine the relevant data from the table: To verify this claim, we need to find a row in the table that matches the following conditions:\n   - The team name in the \"runners up\" column should be \"Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\".\n   - The year in the \"details\" column should correspond to 1994.\n\n3. Check the data for a match: We search through the rows of the table and find that row number 5 (index 4) matches both conditions as it contains the team name \"Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\" in the \"runners up\" column and the year \"1994\" in the \"details\" column.\n\n4. Extract score information: In this row, we find that the \"score\" column contains the value \"36 - 12\". Since the claim is asking for the points scored by Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs specifically, we focus on the first number in the score, which is indeed 36.\n\n5.

Check if the score column matches the claim: In the 4th row (for \"brisbane broncos\"), the \"score\" value is \"38 - 12\".
