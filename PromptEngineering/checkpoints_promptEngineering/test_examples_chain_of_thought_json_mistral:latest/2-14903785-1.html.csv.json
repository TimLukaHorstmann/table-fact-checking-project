Iterate through the years after 2001: We will check each row starting from the one with a \"year\" value greater than or equal to 2002, up to but not including the row where the \"year\" value is not available (as this would mean we have reached the end of the data).\n\n5. Check for matches: For each year after 2001, we will look for a match in the \"women's doubles\" column that includes both Natia Mariyanaschwili Tschachoian and Gaiane. If we find a match, then we can confirm that they won the women's doubles in that year.\n\n6. Record relevant cells: In case we find a match, we will also record the row index and column name (year and women's doubles) as this information could be useful for validation or further analysis.\n\n7. Determine the answer: If we have found at least one match where both Natia Mariyanaschwili Tschachoian and Gaiane are listed in the \"women's doubles\" column for a year after 2001, then our final answer will be TRUE.
