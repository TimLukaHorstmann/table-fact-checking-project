    "resp": "Here are the steps to check the claim:\n\n1. First, we identify the elements in the table that are relevant to the claim. These would be the ones related to \"Imelda Staunton\", \"Laurence Olivier award\", \"best actress in a musical\", and the year 2013.\n\n2. Next, we compare these selected elements with the information given in the claim. If all four pieces of data match, then the claim is true.\n\n3. Lastly, if all the data matches, we provide an output confirming that the claim is true and list the relevant cells used for comparison.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the parts of the table relevant to the claim (Imelda Staunton, Laurence Olivier award, best actress in a musical, year 2013)\",\n    \"Compare each of these selected elements with the information given in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Imelda Staunton was a nominee in 2012.\n\n2. Identify the relevant columns: Since the claim refers to the year (2012) and the nominee (Imelda Staunton), we will focus on these two columns. The other columns (award ceremony, category, result) are not directly related to our claim.\n\n3. Examine the data: Go through each row of the table and check if there is a match for Imelda Staunton in 2012.\n\n4. Determine the answer: If we find a match (i.e., a row where both the year equals 2012 and the nominee equals Imelda Staunton), then our claim is FALSE because there is no record of Imelda Staunton being nominated in 2012 according to this table. If we do not find any such match, then our claim is TRUE, as there is no evidence suggesting that Imelda Staunton was a nominee in 2012 within the given table.\n\n5. Output the answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify relevant columns\",\n    \"Examine the data to find matching year and nominee\",\n    \"Determine answer based on finding\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
