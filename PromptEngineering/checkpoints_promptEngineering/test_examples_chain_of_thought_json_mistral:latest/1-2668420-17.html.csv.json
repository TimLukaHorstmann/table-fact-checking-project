Check if there are any entries where the result is not \"re - elected\", as this would indicate a different outcome other than re-election in 1794 (since all entries were from years before 1794).\n3. Iterate through each row to find whether the condition in step 2 holds true.\n4. If any row is found with a result other than \"re - elected\", return FALSE and stop the process.\n5. If no such row is found, return TRUE and stop the process.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the column that contains the year of re-election\",\n    \"Step 2: Check if there are any entries where the result is not 're - elected'\",\n    \"Step 3: Iterate through each row to find whether the condition in step 2 holds true.\",\n    \"Step 4: If any row is found with a result other than 're - elected', return FALSE and stop the process.\",\n    \"Step 5: If no such row is found, return TRUE and stop the process.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
