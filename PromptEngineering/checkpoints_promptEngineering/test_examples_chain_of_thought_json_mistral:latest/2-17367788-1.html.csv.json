    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team mentioned in the claim, which is \"boston united\". In the table, we can find the row index of Boston United as 1.\n2. Check the column names to determine the relevant columns for finding out whether the team lost 10 points and its position. The relevant columns are \"lost\" (for number of losses) and \"position\" (for the position of the team).\n3. Look at the \"lost\" column for Boston United's row (row_index = 1), where we find that they have lost 6 matches according to the table data. This is not equal to 10, so the claim that Boston United lost 10 points is FALSE.\n4. Determine Boston United's position by looking at the \"position\" column for their row (row_index = 1), where we find that they are in second position according to the table data.\n5. Compare the information found in steps 3 and 4: Although Boston United did not lose 10 points, they still came in 2nd position. Therefore, the claim \"boston unite lost 10 point , but come in 2nd position\" is FALSE regarding the losing 10 points part, but TRUE about their final position.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"position\"\n  }\n]\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find the row index of the team in the table\",\n    \"Determine the relevant columns for finding out whether the team lost 10 points and its position\",\n    \"Check the 'lost' column for the team's row to determine if they lost 10 points\",\n    \"Find the team's position by looking at the 'position' column for their row\",\n    \"Compare the information found in steps 3 and 4: Whether the team lost 10 points and its final position\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
