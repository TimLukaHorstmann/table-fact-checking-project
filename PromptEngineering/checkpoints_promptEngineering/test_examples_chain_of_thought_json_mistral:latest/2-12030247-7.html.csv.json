Check the \"cash on hand\" and \"total debt\" columns in that row to determine if there is any cash left after paying off the debt.\n4. Compare the values of the \"cash on hand\" and \"total debt\" for Duncan Hunter to see if the difference between them is 132741.\n\nNow, let's analyze the data:\n\n- Duncan Hunter's row index is 8.\n- In the 8th row, the value for \"cash on hand\" is 132741 (column 5).\n- In the 8th row, the value for \"total debt\" is 82741 (column 6).\n\nComparing these values, we can see that 132741 - 82741 = 50000, which does not match our claim of 132741.
