    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Santiago Luna Miguel Angel Martin was the runner-up behind Tiger Woods in 1999.\n2. Determine the relevant data for the year 1999: Since the event we are interested in happened in 1999, we need to find the row corresponding to this year.\n3. Check if the individual listed as the runner-up matches the name Santiago Luna Miguel Angel Martin: In the row where the year is 1999, the runner-up is listed as \"Santiago luna & miguel angel martin\". By separating the first and last names, we can see that one of the names (\"Santiago luna\") matches with Santiago Luna, while the other name (\"miguel angel martin\") appears to be a combination of two separate names. However, it is common in golf events for teams to consist of two players, each listed individually in the table but combined in the \"runner-ups\" column.\n4. Determine if Tiger Woods was the winner: In the same row, the individual column lists Tiger Woods as one of the winners. Therefore, he cannot be the runner-up. However, since Tiger Woods is part of a team with Mark O'Meara, we need to consider whether any other player from this team won individually.\n5. Check if there are multiple winners: Since there are two players listed in the \"team\" column for 1999 (Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods), we should check if both of them are also listed as individual winners. In our table, it appears that only Tiger Woods is individually listed as a winner, suggesting that Mark O'Meara might be the runner-up.\n6. Confirm that Mark O'Meara is not the runner-up: Although we can't definitively prove that Mark O'Meara is not the runner-up without more information about the event rules and scoring, we can observe that the runner-up for 1999 is listed as \"Santiago luna & miguel angel martin\", a team consisting of two players. Since we know one of these players (Tiger Woods) was the individual winner and another player from this team (Mark O'Meara) was not individually listed as the winner, it's unlikely that Mark O'Meara is the runner-up.\n7. Determine the actual runner-up: Now that we know neither Tiger Woods nor Mark O'Meara can be the runner-up, we should look at the team that finished second in the event. In this case, the team \"Santiago luna & miguel angel martin\" is listed as the runner-up for 1999.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the relevant data for the year 1999\",\n    \"Check if the individual listed as the runner-up matches Santiago Luna Miguel Angel Martin's name\",\n    \"Determine if Tiger Woods was the winner\",\n    \"Check if there are multiple winners\",\n    \"Confirm that Mark O'Meara is not the runner-up\",\n    \"Determine the actual runner-up\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\" }\n  ]\n}",

The claim states that \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1997\".\n2. Examine the columns of the table. The 'year' column is relevant as we are looking for the year 1997. Other relevant columns are 'country', 'team', 'individual', 'location', and 'runners - up'.\n3. Scan the data rows to find a row with the 'year' equal to 1997. The third row has the required year value.\n4. Compare the 'team' and 'individual' in the third row with the claimant's name (santiago luna miguel angel martin). The team in the third row is \"p\u00e1draig harrington & paul mcginley\" which does not match the name. However, the 'individual' in the third row is \"colin montgomerie\", one of the names in the claim.\n5. Check if the 'runners - up' in the third row matches with the other name in the claim (miguel angel martin). The runners-up in the third row are \"colin montgomerie & raymond russell\". The second name, \"raymond russell\", does not match the name of interest, but we do see \"colin montgomerie\" again. This implies that one of the runners-up was Colin Montgomerie.\n6. Conclude that while the table shows that Colin Montgomerie was a runner-up in 1997 (as indicated by both his individual performance and as part of the runners-up team), it does not provide direct evidence that Miguel Angel Martin was a runner-up behind Tiger Woods in 1997.
