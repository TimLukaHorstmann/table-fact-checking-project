Identify the key information from the table, which includes the date (to check for November 6) and the player's score (to compare each player's points on that day).\n2. Loop through the \"data\" array in the JSON object and find the row where the value of the \"date\" column matches \"november 6\".\n3. In the row found, check if the value of the \"score\" column equals 30 for the player Tyreke Evans. If yes, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row in the 'data' array where the value of the 'date' column equals 'november 6'.\",\n    \"Check if the value of the 'score' column for Tyreke Evans equals 30.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\" // Tyreke Evans is in the 'team' column but since the claim mentions his name explicitly, it can be assumed that this row is relevant.\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n   1. Identify the claim statement, which is \"tyreke evans score more than 30 point on november 5 in an epic game\". To validate this claim, we will focus on checking if there exists a row where Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points and the date matches November 5.\n   2. Compare the dates mentioned in the table (November 1, November 3, ..., November 27) to find out if the given date (November 5) is present.\n   3. If the given date is found, check the \"score\" column for that row to determine if Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points.\n   4. If both conditions are met, then the claim can be considered true as Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points on November 5 in an epic game (according to this table).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if the given date is present in the data\",\n    \"If yes, check if Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points for that row\",\n    \"If both conditions are met, consider the claim as true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
