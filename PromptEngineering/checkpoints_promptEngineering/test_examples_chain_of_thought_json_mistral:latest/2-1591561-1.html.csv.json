Check the column for fatalities in the selected row: In this row, the 'fatalities' column contains \"unknown\".\n\n4. Compare the found data with the claim: Since the value found in step 3 matches the requirement of being unknown as stated in the claim, we can conclude that the number of fatalities for aircraft ju - 52 is indeed unknown.\n\nNow, here's my final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the aircraft whose fatalities are in question\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to this aircraft\",\n    \"Check the column for fatalities in the selected row\",\n    \"Compare the found data with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
