    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that during 1986, the value for 'us dance' should be 6 when the value of 'us r&b' is 9.\n\n2. Check if there are any rows where the year matches 1986: Yes, there are two rows with the year 1986.\n\n3. Verify if any of these rows have a value of 9 in the 'us r&b' column: One row has a value of 9 in the 'us r&b' column (row_index=1).\n\n4. Check if the same row also has a value of 6 in the 'us dance' column: Yes, the same row (row_index=1) does have a value of 6 in the 'us dance' column.\n\n5. Confirm that this matches the given claim: The condition specified in the claim is satisfied for row 1 with year 1986 (matches year and 'us r&b' equals 9), and also has the desired value in 'us dance' (equals 6).\n\nNow, let's present the final answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Check if there are any rows where the year matches 1986\",\n    \"Verify if any of these rows have a value of 9 in the 'us r&b' column\",\n    \"Check if the same row also has a value of 6 in the 'us dance' column\",\n    \"Confirm that this matches the given claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"us dance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"under the influence\" chart at 56 in the US in 1985 and 1986.\n2. Determine the relevant columns: Since we are looking for the US data, we only consider the \"year\" and \"us\" columns as they provide the year and value respectively.\n3. Identify the rows where the title matches the one in question: We need to find the rows where the title of the album is \"under the influence\".\n4. Check the values in the US column for matching rows: In each row with a matching title, we will check if the number in the \"us\" column equals 56.\n5. Determine if the claim is true or false based on the findings above: If we find a match where both the year and the value in the \"us\" column equal 56, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nBased on the table provided, here's the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: 'under the influence' chart at 56 in the US in 1985 and 1986\",\n    \"Determine the relevant columns: 'year' and 'us'\",\n    \"Identify the rows where the title matches the one in question: 'under the influence'\",\n    \"Check the values in the US column for matching rows: Find rows where the value equals 56 and the year is either 1985 or 1986\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is true or false based on the findings above\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"us\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
