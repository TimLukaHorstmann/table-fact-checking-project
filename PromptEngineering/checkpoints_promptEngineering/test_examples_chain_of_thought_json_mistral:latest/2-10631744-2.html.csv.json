Compare the \"overall win percentage\" value for John E Erickson (row_index=7, column_name=\"overall win percentage\") with that of Bud Foster (row_index=5, column_name=\"overall win percentage\").\n\n4. The overall win percentage values are in the format of a string that represents a decimal number. We can convert these strings to numbers for comparison purposes. To do this, use the built-in JavaScript `parseFloat()` function to parse each value as a floating point number.\n\n5.

Compare the \"years\" values of each coach to determine if one was more than fifty years before the other.\n4. Convert both years into a consistent format (e.g.,YYYY) for comparison. Since the table uses date ranges, we will use the start year of each coach's tenure. For Haskell Noyes, the start year is 1908 and for Steve Yoder, it is 1968.\n5. Subtract the start year of Steve Yoder from the start year of Haskell Noyes to determine the difference in years.
