Iterate through each row to find the home team score that matches the claim's value: We need to find a row where the \"home team score\" column equals 21.16 (142).\n\n4. Check if the corresponding away team in the found row is fitzroy: Once we have the row with the correct home team score, we will check if the \"away team\" value in that row is equal to 'fitzroy'.\n\n5.
