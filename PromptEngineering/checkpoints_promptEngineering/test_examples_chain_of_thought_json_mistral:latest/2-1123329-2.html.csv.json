Locate the \"time / retired\" column in the table since it contains the time values for each driver.\n3. Observe that the time value for Mika Hakkinen is \"1:51:23.595\", which can be converted into seconds by removing the colons and converting minutes and hours to seconds (1 minute = 60 seconds, 1 hour = 3600 seconds). In this case, Mika's time in seconds is 58435.95.\n4. Similarly, convert Giancarlo Fisichella's time value \"+ 11.475\" into seconds by adding the decimal value to the total number of seconds in a minute (60) since the time difference was given in minutes. So, Giancarlo's time in seconds is 684.75.\n5. Compare the times obtained from steps 3 and 4 to determine if there is a difference between them.

It represents the results of the 1998 Monaco Grand Prix, including driver names, constructor teams, number of laps completed, time (or whether retired), and starting grid position.\n\n2. To verify if a driver could not finish the race, we need to check for two conditions:\n   - Retired drivers: These are drivers whose time has an actual value instead of \"+ x laps\" or \"gearbox\", \"wheel\", \"suspension\", etc. For example, Giancarlo Fisichella did not finish the race as his time is recorded (11.475 seconds).\n   - Drivers who did not start the race: These are drivers with \"did not qualify\" in the grid column. For example, Riccardo Rosset did not start the race.\n\n3. Now, we need to find out if there were 11 such drivers (either retired or didn't start) to support the claim. Let's first count the number of drivers who either retired or did not start the race.\n\n4. In this table, Giancarlo Fisichella, Jean Alesi, Jarno Trulli, Olivier Panis, Ralf Schumacher, Jan Magnussen, David Coulthard, Rubens Barrichello, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Esteban Tuero, and Riccardo Rosset either retired (Fisichella, Alesi, Trulli, Panis, Schumacher, Magnussen, Coulthard, Barrichello) or did not start the race (Tuero, Rosset).\n\n5.
