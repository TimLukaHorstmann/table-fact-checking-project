    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, identify all roller coasters at Drayton Manor. In this case, there are no specifications about the location of the roller coasters in the table, but we can assume that any roller coaster listed with \"action park\" as the themed area is not at Drayton Manor, because it's not mentioned anywhere. Therefore, the relevant roller coasters are those labeled as \"aerial park\" and \"thomas land\".\n2. Next, determine which ones are roller coasters. Since our claim refers to roller coasters, we only need to consider rows with style column values that are either \"standing up rollercoaster\" or \"steel sit down\". In this case, the relevant roller coasters are:\n   - \"buffalo mountain coaster\" (row index 2)\n   - \"ben 10 - ultimate mission\" (row index 3)\n   - \"troublesome trucks runaway coaster\" (row index 5)\n3. After that, compare the manufacturers of these roller coasters to check if they are unique. Here we can see that the manufacturer of \"buffalo mountain coaster\" is \"zamperla\", while the manufacturers of the other two are different (\"vekoma\" for \"ben 10 - ultimate mission\" and \"gerstlauer\" for \"troublesome trucks runaway coaster\").\n4. Since the manufacturers are not the same, it means that at least two roller coasters have a different manufacturer, which contradicts the claim that each roller coaster at Drayton Manor has a unique manufacturer.\n5.
