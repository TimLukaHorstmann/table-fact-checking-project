Understand the structure of the given table: The table contains two main sections - 'columns' and 'data'. Columns represent the headers for the rows in the data section. Each row (or cell) in the data section has a corresponding value for each column, represented by its index within that row.\n\n3. Identify the relevant cells based on the claim: We are looking for the episode airdate and title from March 31, 2008. This means we should look for the row where 'original airdate' equals \"march 31 , 2008\".\n\n4. Examine the data section to find the relevant cell(s): Browse through the rows in the data section until you find a row where 'original airdate' matches the date mentioned in the claim (March 31, 2008).\n\n5. Compare the found cell with the given claim: Once we have located the relevant row, compare the value of its 'episode title' column with the title mentioned in the claim (\"new york : secret societies\").\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim, which states that the title of the episode that aired on January 28, 2008 should be \"Vietnam\" and the host should be \"don wildman\".\n\n2. Locate the relevant row in the table by finding the episode number (episode no) for the date \"january 28 , 2008\". In this case, it's the first row as the index corresponds to the episode number (episode no).\n\n3. Verify that the title of the episode matches \"Vietnam\" by checking the fourth column (\"episode title\") in the identified row. The value is indeed \"underground apocalypse\", which does not match the claim.\n\n4. However, it's important to note that sometimes episodes might have alternate or misleading titles. So we should also check if there could be a connection between the actual episode title and the claimed title. In this case, the episode title \"underground apocalypse\" seems unrelated to \"Vietnam\".\n\n5. Additionally, verify that the host of the episode matches \"don wildman\" by checking the fifth column (\"host\") in the identified row. The value is \"don wildman\", which corresponds with the claim.\n\n6. Since we found a discrepancy between the title and the claimed title, but not the host, it seems that the provided claim is not TRUE.\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Locate the relevant row based on date\",\n    \"Verify if episode title matches claimed title\",\n    \"Check if there could be a connection between actual and claimed titles\",\n    \"Verify host of the episode matches claimed host\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"episode title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"host\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
