Identify the relevant column for points from the table, but since no such column exists, we need to calculate the points scored by each team based on the 'result' column.

Iterate through each row in the 'data' array to determine the points scored for each game. To do this, we will create a function that takes the result string and returns the score difference as an integer. In Python, it would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_score(result):\n  words = result.split()\n  if words[0] == 'w':\n    return int(words[1]) - int(words[3])\n  else:\n    return int(words[1]) - int(words[2])\n```\n\n3.
