Secondly, we need to find the next smallest administrative division after excluding the special entries like \"belford roxo\" and \"mesquita\" that have a 0 population in 2010 census. This is because these entries are essentially not existing cities, so they don't have proper successors.\n3. To find the next smallest administrative division, we will sort the table by the area (km square) in ascending order and remove the special entries. Then, we take the second-smallest entry (excluding the special ones). The area of this administrative division can be found by looking for the row where the column \"administrative division\" does not match \"belford roxo\", \"mesquita\", and then checking the value in the column \"area (km square)\".\n4.
