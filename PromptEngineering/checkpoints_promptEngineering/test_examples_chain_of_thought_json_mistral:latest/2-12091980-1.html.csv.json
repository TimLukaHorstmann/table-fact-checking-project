    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that no game played results in a goal for less than 30.\n\n2. Understand the table structure: The table contains the team, games played, wins, losses, ties, goals for, and goals against for each team.\n\n3. Check the values of the \"goals for\" column: Go through each row to check the number of goals scored (the \"goals for\" column) by each team.\n\n4. Determine if any value is less than 30: In this table, no team's goal for value is less than 30. The smallest goal for value is 30 from the \"montreal shamrocks\", but their value (0 wins and 10 losses) suggests that they have played games where goals were scored, so it cannot be concluded that a game was not played when the goal for was less than 30.\n\n5. Final answer: Since there's no clear evidence in the table to support the claim, it can be said that the claim is FALSE. However, the data provided does not exclude the possibility that a game with fewer goals might have occurred but was not recorded in this table.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Check the values of the 'goals for' column\",\n    \"Determine if any value is less than 30\",\n    \"Final answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" }\n  ]\n}",
