    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the table's structure to understand what each column represents.\n    - game: The unique identifier for each row of data. (Not relevant here)\n    - date: The date when the game was played.\n    - team: The team that played on the given date.\n    - score: The result of the game, with the home team listed first and followed by a space and then the away team's score.\n    - high points: The highest scorer for the team on the given date.\n    - high rebounds: The player who grabbed the most rebounds for the team on the given date.\n    - high assists: The player with the most assists for the team on the given date.\n    - location attendance: The name of the stadium and its attendance on the given date.\n    - record: The current win-loss record of the team after playing the games listed in this table.\n\n2. Check the row in the table where the 'date' column matches the given date, \"november 16\".\n\n3. Extract the score from that specific row to compare it with the given claim score, \"123 - 126\".\n\n4. Compare the extracted score with the claimed score to check if they match or not.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in a valid JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Find row where 'date' equals 'november 16'\",\n    \"Extract score from that row\",\n    \"Compare extracted score with given claim score\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
