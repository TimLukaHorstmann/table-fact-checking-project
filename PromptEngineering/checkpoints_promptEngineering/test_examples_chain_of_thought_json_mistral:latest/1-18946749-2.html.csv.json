    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the mountain for which we want to check the peak elevation. In this case, it's \"mount wilhelm\".\n2. Look for a row in the table where the \"country\", \"island\" and \"peak\" match the given mountain. Since the column names are consistent with the provided data, we will look for rows where \"country\" = \"papua new guinea\", \"island\" is either \"new guinea\" or the name of an island if specified (in this case, it's not specified), and \"peak\" matches \"mount wilhelm\".\n3. If a matching row is found, check the value in the \"elevation\" column for that row. In our table, columns do not have explicit names but can be inferred by their position. Since elevations are numerical values located after the mountain name and before the \"meter high\", we will look for a numeric value at the same relative position as the peak name in the matching row.\n4. Compare the found elevation with the given value (4509 meters). If they match, then the claim is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\nWith this reasoning process in mind, let's find the answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the mountain for which we want to check the peak elevation\",\n    \"Find a row where 'country', 'island' and 'peak' match the given mountain\",\n    \"If a matching row is found, look for a numeric value at the same relative position as the peak name in the matching row\",\n    \"Compare the found elevation with the given value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"elevation\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
