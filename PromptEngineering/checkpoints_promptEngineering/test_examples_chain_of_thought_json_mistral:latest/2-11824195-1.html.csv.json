Search for a row where the opponent column matches \"miami dolphins\".\n3. Check if the attendance value in the found row is 34063.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can check the table for rows that meet our criteria:\n\n1. We find a row with an opponent of \"miami dolphins\" at index 10.\n2. The attendance value in this row is 34063.\n\nTherefore, the final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance\",\n    \"Search for a row where the opponent column matches 'miami dolphins'\",\n    \"Check if the attendance value in the found row is 34063\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The columns are 'week', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', and 'attendance'.\n2. Determine the week number of the game we are interested in. In this case, we are asked about the crowd attendance for the week 6 game.\n3. Find the row in the table that corresponds to the specified week (week 6). The data is a list of lists where each sublist represents a row and contains the values for each column. Each row has an index starting from 0, so we look for the row with an index of 5, since the week numbered 6 in this table corresponds to the 6th row.\n4. Examine the 'attendance' value in the found row to determine if it is equal to the given crowd attendance (33057).\n\nNow let me provide the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names, find week number of interest, locate corresponding row, check 'attendance' value in found row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}",
