Check if the result of that match shows a loss for Chelsea FC: The corresponding cell in the \"Result\" column is not explicitly stated, but if we look at the 'Home Team' and 'Away Team' columns, we can deduce that it's a away game, and according to the table data, Chelsea FC does not lose any away games against Manchester United.\n\n4.
