For each row of the data array, check if the network matches the one identified in step 1. If it does, then consider that particular year for further analysis.\n\n3. Determine whether the person listed as \"lap - by - lap\" in the current row matches the one specified in the claim (in this case, \"bill flemming\").\n\n4. Check if there is a second person listed under \"pit reporters\" in the current row that matches the one mentioned in the claim (\"chris economaki\"). If there is only one pit reporter and it's a match, then consider that they might be the same person who reported from the pit during those laps, but this is not explicitly stated in the table.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all rows where the network matches the specified one.\n\n6.
