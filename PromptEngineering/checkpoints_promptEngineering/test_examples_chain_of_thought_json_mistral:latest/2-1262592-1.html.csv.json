Identify the key elements in the claim: The claim states that there was a 6 year run on Goodyear tires for Ensign Racing (indicated by \"g\" or \"m a\") where they earned points in 3 years.\n\n2. Determine the timeframe for the Goodyear tire usage: From the table, we can see that rows with \"g\" or \"m a\" in the tyres column represent Goodyear tires. The first row with Goodyear tires is from 1975, so we start from this year.\n\n3. Identify the end of the 6 year run: To find the end of the 6 year run, we look for the row that comes 6 rows after the first Goodyear tire usage row (1975). This would be the row with an index of 1975 + 6 = 1981.\n\n4. Check if there are any points earned during this 6 year period: We scan through the relevant rows from 1975 to 1981 (inclusive) and look for non-zero values in the \"points\" column.\n\n5. Count the number of years with points earned: If we find more than 3 years with non-zero values, it means that Ensign Racing earned points in more than 3 years during the 6 year run on Goodyear tires, which contradicts the claim. Otherwise, if we find exactly 3 or fewer years with non-zero values, it supports the claim.\n\nNow, let's present the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key elements in the claim\",\n    \"Determine timeframe for Goodyear tire usage\",\n    \"Find the end of the 6 year run\",\n    \"Check if there are any points earned during this period\",\n    \"Count the number of years with points earned\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
