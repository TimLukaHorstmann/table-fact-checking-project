    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the row corresponding to July 8th. The date column provides the dates for each game. We compare \"july 8\" with the values in the data[\"data\"] array until we find a match. In this case, the matching row index is 7 (index starts at 0).\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the score of the game on July 8th. The fourth element in each sub-array corresponds to the score column. So, for row 7, the score is \"l 50 - 48\". This indicates a loss.\n\n3. Finally, we compare this result with the claim that \"on july 8 the score be a loss if 50 - 48\". Since the game on July 8th ended in a loss (as per the table), our answer is true.\n\n   Here's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Find the row corresponding to 'july 8'.\",\n       \"Determine the score of the game from the fourth element of the selected row.\",\n       \"Compare the determined score with the given claim.\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 7,\n         \"column_name\": \"score\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }",
