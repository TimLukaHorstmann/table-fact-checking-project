    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that after 1985, the United States contributed two players, with Rafael Arajo being the most recent.\n\n2. Determine the timeline of players' years for Jazz: To answer this question, we need to compare the years each player was active with the Jazz (the \"years for jazz\" column).\n\n3. Find the row indices of players that joined after 1985: We will loop through the rows and check if the year in each row is later than 1985.\n\n4. Verify if there are two or more players joining after 1985: After finding the players who joined after 1985, we will count how many of them are there (excluding Rafael Arajo).\n\n5. Check if Rafael Arajo is the most recent player among those who joined after 1985: Finally, we will check if Rafael Arajo is indeed the most recent player among the ones found in step 4.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Determine timeline of players' years for Jazz\",\n    \"Find row indices of players that joined after 1985\",\n    \"Verify if there are two or more players joining after 1985 (excluding Rafael Arajo)\",\n    \"Check if Rafael Arajo is the most recent player among those found in step 4\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\" }\n  ]\n}",
