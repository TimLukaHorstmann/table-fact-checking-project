Identify the claim to be evaluated: The claim is that \"d beadman be the jockey at rosehill and the weight be 57.5 kg\".\n\n2. Extract relevant data from the table: To check if \"d beadman\" is the jockey, I will look for all rows where the \"jockey\" column matches \"d beadman\". To check if \"rosehill\" appears as a venue, I will look for all rows where the \"venue\" column matches \"rosehill\". To check if the weight is 57.5 kg, I will look for all rows where the \"weight (kg)\" column matches 57.5.\n\n3. Examine each row that meets the conditions from step 2: For each row where both \"jockey\" equals \"d beadman\" and \"venue\" equals \"rosehill\", check if the weight is also 57.5 kg. If all these conditions are met for a single row, then the claim is true.\n\n4. Determine the final answer: If there exists at least one row that meets all the conditions in step 3, then the answer is TRUE.

This will be the race we are interested in, as it matches the time from the claim.\n3. In the row with the time \"1:36.30\", check the \"winner / 2nd\" column to see if it shows the horse that won the race.\n4.
