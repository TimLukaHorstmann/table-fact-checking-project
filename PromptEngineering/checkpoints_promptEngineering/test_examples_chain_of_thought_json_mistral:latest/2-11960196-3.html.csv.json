Go through each row of data and find out how many times 'iguodala' has the highest number of assists in a game.\n3. In order to find this, I will look for the maximum value in the 'high assists' column for each row where the 'team' is 'detroit', since the claim only refers to games involving the Detroit team.\n4. If the maximum value in the 'high assists' column for any of these rows equals 'iguodala (x)', then we can conclude that Iguodala had the highest number of assists in 4 games (or more, if there are ties).\n\nNow let's analyze the data:\n- Row 1: Miller has a higher number of assists than Iguodala (20 > 8), so Iguodala didn't have the highest number of assists.\n- Row 2: Williams has a higher number of assists than Iguodala (17 > 8), so Iguodala didn't have the highest number of assists.\n- Row 3: Green and Iguodala both have 6 assists, but Dalembert has a higher number of rebounds, which makes him the high statistic for this row. Therefore, Iguodala didn't have the highest number of assists.\n- Row 4: Young has a higher number of assists than Iguodala (15 > 5), so Iguodala didn't have the highest number of assists.\n- Row 5: Iguodala himself has the highest number of assists in this row (21 > 6). So, Iguodala had the highest number of assists in one game.\n- Row 6: Evans and Ollie both have a higher number of assists than Iguodala (3 > 1), so Iguodala didn't have the highest number of assists.\n\nSince Iguodala only had the highest number of assists in one game, it can be concluded that he did not have the high assist in 4 games as stated in the claim.\n\nNow let's output the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find player whose assists we want to track: Iguodala\",\n    \"Go through each row of data and find out how many times Iguodala has the highest number of assists in a game\",\n    \"Check for maximum value in 'high assists' column for rows where team is 'detroit'\",\n    \"If the maximum value equals 'iguodala (x)', then Iguodala had the high assist in 4 games or more\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
