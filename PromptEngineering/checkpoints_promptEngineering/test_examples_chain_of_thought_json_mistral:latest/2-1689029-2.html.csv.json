Identify the claim's key elements: The claim mentions a single release by INXS ahead of their album in 1980, which became their first Australian top 40 hit. We need to find any row in the table that matches these criteria.\n\n2. Loop through each row in the data array and check if the \"label\", \"country\", \"date\", and format (if applicable) match the claim's requirements:\n   - The label should be 'mercury records' since INXS were signed to Mercury Records at that time.\n   - The country should be 'aus' because we are looking for their first Australian top 40 hit.\n   - The year should be closer to or equal to 1980 since it needs to be before the album release (we don't have specific information about the album release date).\n   - If a row has 'lp' as format, it means it is an LP (Long Play) record. Since singles are usually released in various formats such as 7\" or 12\" vinyl, we cannot definitively determine if it is a single from this data alone. However, since the claim specifically mentions \"the single,\" we can assume that the format should be 'lp' for consistency with the rest of the table.\n\n3. If a row matches all the above criteria, check if there exists another row in the data array where the same label, country, and format have an earlier date than the selected row but are not labeled as a single (since singles usually come before albums). If such a row exists, then it contradicts the claim that this was their first Australian top 40 hit.\n\n4. If no conflicting rows are found, then the claim is either true or inconclusive (since we assumed 'lp' format for the single without concrete evidence from the table).
