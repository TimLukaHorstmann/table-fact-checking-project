    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the team we are concerned with: In this case, it's Corinthians. We can find their data by looking for rows where the \"team\" column matches \"corinthians\". The row index of Corinthians is 0.\n2. Look for the lost column: This will tell us how many games Corinthians have lost this season. In the data, it's the third cell in each row, so for Corinthians, it's the third element in the first row. The value here is \"1\".\n3. Compare the number of games played with the number of games lost: If a team has not lost any games, the number of games they have played will be equal to the number of games they have lost. In this case, Corinthians have played 20 games (the value in the \"played\" column for Corinthians), but they have lost 1 game.\n4. Check if Corinthians can lose only 1 more game and remain undefeated: To do this, we compare the total number of games remaining (total games - games already lost) with the number of games that Corinthians can afford to lose while still being undefeated. Since Corinthians have played 20 games and lost 1 game, they have 19 games left to play (since they can't play more than 20 games in a season). If they want to remain undefeated, they can only afford to lose 1 more game.\n5. Conclusion: Since there are fewer than 19 games left for Corinthians to play, it is possible that Corinthians can finish the season undefeated if they win all their remaining games and do not draw any (since they have already drawn 3 games). However, if we assume a worst-case scenario where they lose one more game, then they would still be 1 game away from being undefeated.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team (Corinthians)\",\n    \"Look for the lost column\",\n    \"Compare the number of games played with the number of games lost\",\n    \"Check if Corinthians can lose only 1 more game and remain undefeated\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
