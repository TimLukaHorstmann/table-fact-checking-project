The columns are \"date\", \"visitor\", \"score\", \"home\", \"attendance\", \"record\", and \"points\".\n   * Step 2: Determine the specific row number corresponding to December 26th. In this table, dates are represented as strings. To find the row number, we will look for a date that matches \"december 26\".\n   * Step 3: Verify the score and points for the identified row. According to the data, the row with the date \"december 26\" has the visitor as Pittsburgh (which is the home team in this case since it's the second column), and the score as Pittsburgh 2 - St Louis 3 (since it's represented as a string \"score\": [\"2\", \"-\", \"3\"]). The points for this match are also given as 20.\n   * Step 4: Compare the found data with the claim.
