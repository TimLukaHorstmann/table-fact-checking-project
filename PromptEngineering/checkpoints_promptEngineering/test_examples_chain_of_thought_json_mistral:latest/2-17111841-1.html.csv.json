    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. First, we identify the column names to find the episode number and the original airdate. In this case, the relevant columns are \"episode\" and \"original airdate\".\n2. Next, we look for a row in the data where the \"original airdate\" matches the provided date (in this case, \"8 june 2008\"). We compare each row's \"original airdate\" with the provided date to determine if there is a match.\n3. Once we find a match, we verify that the \"episode\" value in that row corresponds to episode number 4 or higher. Since the episode numbers start from 1, finding an original airdate match on June 8 and having an episode number of 4 would confirm our claim is false (because it's not the earliest episode).\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n- We don't find any row where \"original airdate\" equals \"8 june 2008\". This means that no episodes aired on this date according to the provided data.\n\nSince we did not find an episode that originally aired on June 8, 2008, our claim is FALSE. Here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find relevant columns for comparison (episode and original airdate)\",\n    \"Check each row to see if 'original airdate' matches provided date\",\n    \"If a match is found, verify that the 'episode' number corresponds to episode 4 or earlier\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The least watched episode number on 8 June 2008 should be 4.\n2. Determine the column that contains the episode numbers: The column \"episode\" contains the episode numbers.\n3. Determine the column that contains the original airdate: The column \"original airdate\" contains the original airdates.\n4. Filter the data to find the row with 8 June 2008 as the original airdate: In this dataset, there is no row where the original airdate is exactly 8 June 2008.\n5. Since no row matches the original airdate specified in the claim, we can't compare viewer numbers to determine if episode 4 was the least watched on that date.
