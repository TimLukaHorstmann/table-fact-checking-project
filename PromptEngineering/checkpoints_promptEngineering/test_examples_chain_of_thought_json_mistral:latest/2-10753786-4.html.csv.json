We will search for England (or england) in this column.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine if there are 3 English players on the list. We can count the number of rows where the country is England or england.\n\n3. After identifying the English players, we will check if two out of them do not have any major wins. In the table, the \"majors\" column specifies the number of majors a player has won. We will look for players with zero (0) in this column.\n\n4. Lastly, ensure that at least 2 out of the 3 English players satisfy the condition of not having any major wins.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n- There are 5 rows where the country is England or england (rows 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10). This meets the requirement for there being 3 English players on the list.\n\n- Players in rows 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 have majors values of 2, 6, 2, 0, and 0 respectively. Rows 2, 3, and 10 have a non-zero value in the \"majors\" column, while rows 8 and 9 have zero.\n\n- Since we need two out of three English players not to have any major wins, we can see that this condition is met by at least two players: Rows 8 and 9 (seve ballesteros and luke donald) satisfy this condition.\n\nHere's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify English players by checking the 'country' column\",\n    \"Check if there are exactly 3 English players on the list\",\n    \"Check which English players have won major tournaments (looking for zero in the 'majors' column)\",\n    \"Ensure that at least two out of three English players satisfy the condition of not having any major wins\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"majors\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"majors\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"majors\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"majors\" }\n  ]\n}",
