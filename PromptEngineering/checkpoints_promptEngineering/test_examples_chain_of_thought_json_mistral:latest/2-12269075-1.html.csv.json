In this row, the value for the column named \"1st leg\" represents the score in the first leg of the match. To get the goal scored by guadalajara, we will split the string at the '-' and take the first element, which corresponds to the number of goals scored. In this case, it is 3.\n\n3. Compare the goal scored by guadalajara in the 1st leg with other teams' goals in the 1st leg: To compare, we need to find the scores for other teams in the \"1st leg\" column. The relevant rows are the first, second, third, and fifth since they represent the matches that happened in the 1st leg. We will take the values from the \"1st leg\" column for each of these rows and compare them with the goal scored by guadalajara.\n\n4. Determine if guadalajara scored the highest number of goals in the 1st leg: If any other team scored more goals than guadalajara, then guadalajara did not score the highest number of goals in the 1st leg (i.e., the claim is TRUE). To check this condition, we will iterate over the rows that correspond to the teams playing in the 1st leg and compare their scores with the goal scored by guadalajara.\n\nAfter analyzing the data, it can be observed that none of the teams played more than one match in the 1st leg (i.e., there are no matches involving team1 vs team1 or team2 vs team2), and all the scores for the first leg are less than the score for guadalajara.
