Identify the claim's requirements: The claim requires us to find a locomotive with a broad gauge, serial number 83 - 1018, and which entered service before 1984.\n2. Check the data for each requirement:\n   - For the broad gauge: We need to find a row where the \"gauge\" column is \"broad\".\n   - For the serial number 83 - 1018: We need to find a row where the \"serial no\" column matches this value.\n   - For the service before 1984: We need to find a row where the \"entered service\" date is before '1984-01-01'.\n\n3. Traverse the table data:\n   - First, we check if there's any row that matches both \"broad gauge\" and serial number 83 - 1018. In this case, the row with index 4 has a broad gauge (column name: \"gauge\") and serial number 83 - 1018 (column name: \"serial no\").\n   - Next, we need to check if the service date is before '1984-01-01'. In this case, the row with index 4 was entered into service in October 1983 (column name: \"entered service\"), which is indeed before '1984-01-01'.\n\n4.
