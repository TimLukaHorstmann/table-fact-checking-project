    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that when the case or suffix is loc, ngalbeniya means we two.\n2. Examine the table structure: The table contains two parts: columns (column names) and data. Column names represent different cases or suffixes, while rows contain corresponding words for each case or suffix.\n3. Identify relevant cells: To test the claim, we will look for the cell that corresponds to 'loc' in the 'case / suffix' column and 'ngalbeniya' in any other column. If this cell exists, we can compare it with the meaning provided in the claim (we two).\n4. Check for the relevant cells: Looking at the data, we find the relevant cell with row_index=0 and column_name='loc'. Its value is 'ngalbeniya'. However, to confirm whether this phrase means 'we two', we should find another cell that corresponds to 'we two' in any other case.\n5. Check for the meaning of 'we two': We need to look for a phrase that represents 'we two' in any other case/suffix. In this table, there is no direct translation of 'we two'. Instead, we find 'ngalbe' (nom - acc - inst) which seems to correspond to 'we two'.\n6. Compare the relevant cells: We compare the two phrases found for 'loc' and 'nom - acc - inst'. If they are the same or have similar meanings, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n7. Evaluate the comparison result: The phrases 'ngalbeniya' (loc) and 'ngalbe' (nom - acc - inst) do not appear to be the same or have similar meanings. However, since there is no direct translation of 'we two' in this table, we cannot definitively confirm whether the claim is true or false based on this table alone.\n8.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the subject cases from the claim: We two (ngalbe) and them two (the two) (palai).\n2. Locate the corresponding instances of these subjects in the data table: \"we two\" is in row 0, column 2 (ngba), and \"them two\" is in row 1, column 5 (palamun).\n3. Find the corresponding verbs for each subject in the dat (action) row of the table. For \"we two\", it's ngalbelpa, and for \"them two\", it's palamulpa (boigu palemulpa). However, since we're interested in comparing \"ngalbelpa\" and \"palamulpa\", let's first extract just \"palamulpa\".\n4. Compare the verbs for each subject: \"ngalbelpa\" and \"palamulpa\" (extracted from \"palamulpa\"). Note that \"palamulpa\" is actually a compound verb consisting of \"palamu\" and \"pala\", but since we're only interested in comparing the root verbs, we can disregard the suffix \"pala\".\n5. Check if \"ngalbelpa\" is equivalent to \"palamu\" (the root verb extracted from \"palamulpa\"): To do this, we need to find their corresponding roots in the given table. The roots for each case are listed in the nom-acc-inst row: \"ngalbe\" and \"(as for singular)\". Since \"palamu\" doesn't appear in the table, we can't directly compare its root form. However, since the claim only asks if they're equivalent (not identical), we can observe that \"ngalbe\" is a part of the compound verb \"ngalbelpa\", and \"palamu\" is a part of the compound verb \"palamulpa\". Given that the claim doesn't specify the root forms explicitly, this observation allows us to conclude that they are not necessarily equivalent in terms of their root forms but are equivalent as compound verbs.\n6. Since both subjects (ngalbe and palai) have verbs that correspond to each other (ngalbelpa and palamulpa), the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify subjects from claim: we two, them two\",\n    \"Locate subjects in table: ngalbe (row 0, column 2), palai (row 1, column 5)\",\n    \"Find corresponding verbs for each subject: ngalbelpa, palamulpa\",\n    \"Extract root verb from 'palamulpa': palamu\",\n    \"Compare roots of verbs: ngalbe (for ngalbelpa), palamu (for palamulpa)\",\n    \"Since the claim doesn't specify exact root form equality, observe that both verbs are parts of compound verbs and compare them as such\",\n    \"Conclude: they correspond to each other, and the claim is TRUE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"we two\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"dat\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"them two\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"dat\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Determine the grammatical case when \"you and i\" is in the ablative case: To find this, we look at the fourth row of the table for the data column where the cases are listed. The ablative form for \"you and i\" (ngba) is \"ngbalngu\".\n\n3. Identify the grammatical case for \"them two (the two)\": From the table, we can see that \"them two (the two)\" corresponds to the fifth row of the data column where the cases are listed, and its instance form is \"palai (boigu pale)\". However, since we're trying to find the ablative form for \"them two\", we need to look at the cell in the fourth row that corresponds to the ablative case. For the fifth row, it states \"(as for singular)\", which doesn't provide a specific form for \"them two\" in the ablative case.\n\n4.

Find the corresponding rows: The claim involves two subjects: \"you and i\" and \"them two\". We need to find their respective representations in the table. From the data, we see that \"you and i\" is represented as \"ngba\" and \"them two\" (or 'who - two') is represented as \"palai (boigu pale)\".\n\n4. Compare the forms: To verify the claim, we need to check if the form of \"you and i\" changes to \"ng\u0153ba\" and if the form of \"them two\" changes to \"palamulngu (boigu palemulngu)\" under any case. However, the table does not provide a case for \"ng\u0153ba\", so we cannot confirm or deny the claim directly from this data.\n\nFinal answer: {\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify the relevant columns\",\n    \"Find the corresponding rows\",\n    \"Compare the forms\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nom - acc - inst\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gen\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"dat\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"abl\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loc\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nom - acc - inst\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gen\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"dat\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"abl\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loc\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the subjects mentioned in the claim: \"ngalben\" (representing \"we two\") and \"ngipeniya\" (representing the location for \"you two\").\n2. Check if there is any information provided in the table regarding the relationship between \"we two\" and \"you two\". However, the table does not explicitly provide such information.\n3. In the absence of explicit information, we can consider checking the grammatical structure of the sentences related to \"ngalben\" and \"ngipeniya\", as they might provide a clue.\n4. Check the row for \"we two\" (ngalben) in the table. The grammatical case for \"ngalben\" is nominative (\"nom - acc - inst\") in the first column, which suggests that it is the subject of a sentence or phrase.\n5. Similarly, check the row for \"you two\" (ngipeniya) in the table. The location for \"ngipeniya\" is given as the last row under \"loc\", but its grammatical case is not explicitly mentioned. However, since it represents a location and locations are usually associated with the locative (lo) case in many languages, we can infer that it should have been \"ngipeniya (lo)\" if this were the case. But it's not, which suggests that \"ngipeniya\" might be functioning as an adverb or part of a phrase rather than a noun in this context.\n6. Since we don't have enough information to establish a direct relationship between \"ngalben\" and \"ngipeniya\", we cannot confirm the claim definitively.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify subjects in the claim: 'ngalben', 'ngipeniya'.\",\n    \"Check for explicit information about their relationship.\",\n    \"Inspect grammatical structure of sentences related to 'ngalben' and 'ngipeniya'.\",\n    \"Check case of 'ngalben': nominative.
