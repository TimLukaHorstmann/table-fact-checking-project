    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the table structure: The table contains two sections - 'columns' and 'data'. Columns contain the headers, while data contains the rows with values for each column.\n2. Understand the claim: The claim is that Ukraine has a total score of 2 with 0 gold and 1 silver.\n3. Find Ukraine's row in the table: Locate the row where 'nation' equals \"ukraine\". In this case, it is at index 7 (row_index=7).\n4. Check relevant values for Ukraine: Examine the values of the 'gold', 'silver', and 'total' columns in the identified row.\n5. Compare found values with the claim: Verify that the values for 'gold' and 'silver' match those stated in the claim, i.e., 0 gold and 1 silver. Also, confirm that the total score is equal to the sum of gold, silver, and bronze, which should result in a value of 2 (since we know from step 4 that there are 0 golds and 1 silvers).\n\nNow, let me provide my final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure\", \"Understand the claim\", \"Find Ukraine's row in the table\", \"Check relevant values for Ukraine\", \"Compare found values with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
