Examine the table structure: The table has columns named \"date\", \"opponent\", \"site\", \"result\", and \"attendance\".\n3. Compare the opponents listed in the table with the opponent mentioned in the claim (iowa).\n4. Identify the rows that correspond to iowa in the 'data' array.\n5. Check the 'site' column for each row identified to see if it matches the site mentioned in the claim (memorial stadium, minneapolis, mn)\n6. If a match is found, then the game against iowa did take place at memorial stadium, minneapolis, mn.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Examine table structure\",\n    \"Compare opponents\",\n    \"Identify rows corresponding to iowa\",\n    \"Check site column for each row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Iterate through each row of the \"data\" array to check the value in the \"site\" column for the game against Michigan. The date of the game against Michigan is 11/21/1931, so we need to look for a row with this date in the \"date\" column and \"michigan\" in the \"opponent\" column.\n3.
