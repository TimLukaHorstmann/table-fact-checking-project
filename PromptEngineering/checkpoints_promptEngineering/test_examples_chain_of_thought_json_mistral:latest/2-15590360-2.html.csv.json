In this case, it's the \"pole\" column.\n2. Identify the row(s) that correspond to the \"moto2\" class since that's what the claim refers to. In this case, there is only one such row with a row_index of 3.\n3. Check the value in the identified cell (the intersection of the relevant row and column). If the value is non-zero, then the claim is false; otherwise, it is true.\n4. Output the final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the 'pole' column\", \"Identify the row corresponding to 'moto2'\", \"Check the value at the intersection of the identified row and column\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Examine the columns of the table to determine if they contain any relevant data for the claim. The relevant columns are \"class\" (since the claim mentions a class) and \"pole\" (since it talks about poles).\n2. Check each row in the data to see if the class column matches \"moto2\" and if there is any value in the pole column for that row.\n3. Start with the first row, which has a class of \"125 cc\", so we can skip it. Move on to the second row, which has a class of \"250 cc\". Since this is not \"moto2\", we can also skip it. The third and fourth rows have classes that are not \"moto2\" as well.\n4. Reach the fifth row with a class of \"total\", but since total is just a summary, it doesn't represent a specific race or season, so we can't determine if it matches the claim based on this data.\n5. Since none of the rows that represent individual races or seasons have a class of \"moto2\" and a pole value greater than 0, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns for the claim\",\n    \"Check each row to see if it matches the class 'moto2' and has a non-zero value in the 'pole' column\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"class\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"class\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pole\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pole\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pole\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\" }\n  ]\n}",
