Next, check if any team other than South Africa was played more than once.

The last two matches are against Australia and Argentina at Twickenham in November and December, respectively (rows 8 and 9). These are also away games because they occurred after March 2000 (when the Six Nations ended).\n\n4.

Next, I need to find out which of these teams are England's opponents in the Six Nations tournament. To do this, I will look at the \"opposing teams\" column for the relevant rows (0, 2, 4, and 5).

Therefore, I will check if there are any other matches that do not have a \"six nations\" status but are still England's home games. To do this, I will look at all rows where the \"against\" value is England (row 6 and 8) and check if their venue matches with one of the venues used in the Six Nations tournament (Twickenham).\n\n4. In row 6, the opponent is South Africa, and the venue is Loftus Versfeld, which does not match any of the Six Nations venues. In row 8, the opponent is Argentina, and the venue is Twickenham, which is a Six Nations venue. However, Argentina is not one of England's opponents in the Six Nations tournament, so this row can be discarded as well.\n\n5.

Identify the teams that played their matches away: To find England's away matches, we need to identify rows where 'opposing teams' are not \"Ireland\" (since Ireland is considered as the home team in Twickenham according to the table) and the venue is not \"twickenham, london\".\n\n4.
