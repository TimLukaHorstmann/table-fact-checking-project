Determine the value of the run score for the game on September 1 by looking at the \"score\" column in the given table. For September 1, the run score is \"3 - 0\", which can be interpreted as 3 runs were scored by the Mets and 0 runs were scored by their opponent. Therefore, the total run score for September 1 game is 3.\n3. Compare this value with the run scores of all other games in the same table during September. To do so, loop through the entire \"data\" array (except for the first row, which represents the header) and compare the run score of each game with the one from September 1.\n4. If the run score of any other game is equal to or less than the one on September 1, then it means that the lowest run score occurred on a different day in September.
