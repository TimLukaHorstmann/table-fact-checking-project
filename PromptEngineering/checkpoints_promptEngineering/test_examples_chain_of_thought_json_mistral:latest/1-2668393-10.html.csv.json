Iterate through each row of the data to find out which parties won in each district during the year 1799. Since we are looking for a majority win by the Democratic-Republican Party, we will consider districts where the winning party is Democratic-Republican or simply Democratic (as Democratic-Republicans were formed from the Democratic party).\n3. In this table, there are two rows that represent newly created districts in 1799 for which no election was held, so they don't contribute to our analysis. Therefore, we will exclude these rows.\n4. Identify and count the number of districts won by the Democratic-Republican Party (or simply Democratic) during the year 1799. We find that in the remaining four rows, one district was re-elected by a Democratic-Republican incumbent (New York 1), and three new seats were gained by the Democratic-Republican Party in New York 5, New York 6, and New York 14.\n5. Compare the number of districts won by the Democratic-Republican Party to the total number of districts that held elections in 1799 (which is equal to the total number of rows minus the two newly created districts). In this case, there were six districts that held elections in 1799.\n6. Calculate the percentage of districts won by the Democratic-Republican Party: (Number of seats won by DRP / Total number of contested seats) * 100% = (4/6)*100% = 66.67%.\n7. Determine whether the Democratic-Republican Party won a majority in 1799: A majority occurs when a party wins more than 50% of the contested seats.
