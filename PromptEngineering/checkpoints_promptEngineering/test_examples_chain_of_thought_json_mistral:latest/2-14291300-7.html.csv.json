Since we don't have a date column, we cannot directly compare the data in the table with the claim. However, let's check if there's any team listed as an opponent that matches the one with 63 points.\n\n2. Loop through the \"data\" array and find the rows where the \"opponent\" matches \"detroit red wings\". In this table, the only row where the opponent is \"detroit red wings\" is the first row (row_index = 0).\n\n3. Check the value in the \"points\" column of that row to see if it matches 63. In this case, it does (points: 59).\n\n4. Since the team with 63 points (Detroit Red Wings) is listed as an opponent somewhere in the table, we cannot definitively say whether March 13 was the day they were the opponent or not.
