In this case, it's \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building\".\n\n2. Verify that the city of the identified building matches one in the table. In this case, since the table lists \"johannesburg\", and \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building\" is also located in \"johannesburg\", there's a match.\n\n3. Identify the time period specified in the claim (1970 - 1973) and check if any row in the table falls within that range under the column \"years as tallest\". This will help determine whether the building was the tallest during the specified time period.\n\n4. Check if the identified building has \"31\" floors, which is the value in the \"floors\" column for this building according to the table.\n\n5.

Identify the claim: The claim states that a building with a height of 459 feet (approximately 139.7 m) is the fourth largest building in Johannesburg.\n   2. Define criteria for comparison: Since the table provides height, location (city), and years as tallest, we can assume the comparisons should be based on these three factors.\n   3. Sort the data based on the given criteria: First, sort the buildings according to their height in descending order, then by city (Johannesburg first, then Cape Town). In this case, all relevant buildings are in Johannesburg, so no need for further sorting.\n   4. Compare the claim with sorted data: Start checking the buildings one by one starting from the tallest.
