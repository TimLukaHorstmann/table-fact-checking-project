Identify the claim statement and understand that it seeks to find if Rafter Alston had 8 high assists in a game played against Atlanta with a score of w109 - 101 (ot).\n2. Verify the table format and ensure all data is provided as needed for this claim.\n3. Search through the rows of data for a row where the \"team\" column matches \"atlanta\", the \"score\" column indicates a win for the team with a score of 109, and there's an overtime (ot) involved.\n4. If such a row is found, then check the value in the \"high assists\" column for Rafter Alston. If it equals 8, then the claim is true.\n5.
