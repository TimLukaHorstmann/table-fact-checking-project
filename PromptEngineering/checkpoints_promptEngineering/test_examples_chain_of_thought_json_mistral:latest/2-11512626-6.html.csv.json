Identify the claim: The claim is about a specific event on August 27, stating that Remlinger took a loss (record increased by 1) and the Rockies' win-loss record changed to 64 - 70.\n\n2. Locate the relevant data in the table: To check if Remlinger took a loss on August 27, we need to find the row where the 'Record' (6th column) is '6 - 6' and the 'Date' (1st column) is 'August 27'. Similarly, to verify that the Rockies' win-loss record changed to 64 - 70, we need to find the last row where the team name (3rd column) is 'Rockies' and compare the 'Win' (4th column) and 'Loss' (5th column) values with the given win-loss record.\n\n3. Examine the data: In our table, we can see that on August 27, Remlinger indeed had a record of '6 - 6', as he is associated with the Reds team in that row. However, the Rockies' last row shows a win-loss record of 63 - 70 (as of August 29).\n\n4.
