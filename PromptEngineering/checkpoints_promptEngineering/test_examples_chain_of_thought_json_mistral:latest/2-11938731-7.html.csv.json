    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim being made, which is \"only 2 pittsburgh gladiator score touchdowns for the 1987 season\". We need to find all the players who scored touchdowns (have a value greater than 0 in the 'td's' column) and check if they are from Pittsburgh.\n\n2. Since the table doesn't specify which team each player belongs to, we can't directly search for \"pittsburgh\". However, we can use the information that the table is about a football season and assume that the players' names give a clue about their teams. For instance, if a player has a name like \"joel gueli\", we can make an educated guess that this might be a Pittsburgh Gladiator since many team names include the city or mascot.\n\n3. Examine each row of data to find players who scored touchdowns (have a value greater than 0 in the 'td's' column). Check if they have a likely Pittsburgh name. In this table, \"joel gueli\" and \"earnest adams\" are potential Pittsburgh Gladiators based on their names.\n\n4. Check if only two players from the selected group scored touchdowns. In this case, we find that \"joel gueli\" (row index 0) and \"earnest adams\" (row index 12) scored touchdowns.\n\n5. Verify if only these two players scored touchdowns in the table. We don't see any other players with a value greater than 0 in the 'td's' column who could be potential Pittsburgh Gladiators.\n\nWith this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim and its components (team name and number of touchdown scorers).\",\n                       \"Assume Pittsburgh names from player names.\",\n                       \"Examine each row to find players who scored touchdowns.\",\n                       \"Check if they have likely Pittsburgh names.\",\n                       \"Verify if only these two players scored touchdowns in the table.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": 'td \\'s'}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": 'td \\'s'}]\n}",

Next, we focus on the claim that states \"the player with the lowest number of solo tackles is lee larsen\". To verify this, we need to identify the player with the minimum value in the 'solo' column.\n\n3. Since the table is sorted by default, starting from the bottom row will give us the player with the smallest value for each column. In our case, 'lee larsen' at row_index 26 has a value of 2 under the 'solo' column.\n\n4. Comparing this minimum value (2) with all other players in the table, we find that no one has a lower number of solo tackles.\n\n5.
