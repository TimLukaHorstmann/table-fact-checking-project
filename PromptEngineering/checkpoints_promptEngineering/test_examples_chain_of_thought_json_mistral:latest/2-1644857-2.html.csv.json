    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the columns in the table to focus on: country, skip, stolen ends. This is because we are trying to find out if a country has less than 9 stolen ends and the skip is Craig Brown.\n\n2. Loop through each row of data in the table (from row_index 0 to length-1). For each row:\n\n    a. Compare the value in the \"country\" column with \"scotland\". If it matches, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, move on to the next row.\n\n    b. Once we find a match for Scotland, compare the value in the \"skip\" column with \"craig brown\". If they match, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, move on to the next row.\n\n    c. If we do not find a match for Scotland or Craig Brown after checking all rows, the claim is FALSE and we can stop our process.\n\n3. Once we find a match for both Scotland and Craig Brown, compare the value in the \"stolen ends\" column with 9. If it is less than 9, the claim is TRUE and we can stop our process. Otherwise, move on to the next row (since we've already covered all rows that could potentially meet the condition).\n\n4. If after checking all rows, we find that no country meets both conditions (Scotland and stolen ends less than 9), then the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: country, skip, stolen ends\",\n    \"Loop through each row, comparing the values with 'scotland' and 'craig brown'\",\n    \"If a match for Scotland and Craig Brown is found, check if stolen ends < 9\",\n    \"If no match for both conditions is found after checking all rows, claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"skip\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
