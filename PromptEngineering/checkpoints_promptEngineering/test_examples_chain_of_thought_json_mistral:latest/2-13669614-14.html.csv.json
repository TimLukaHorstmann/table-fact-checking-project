    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n   1. Identify the claim: The claim is that \"Jim Maloney\" and \"Marshall Bridges\" were the pitchers in the 7th inning of a game.\n   2. Identify the relevant columns from the table: We need to check the \"pitcher\" column to see who was the pitcher, and the \"inn\" (short for \"innings\") column to determine which inning it was.\n   3. Search the data for the matching rows: We should find a row where the \"pitcher\" value contains both \"Jim Maloney\" and \"Marshall Bridges\", and the \"inn\" value is equal to \"7th\".\n   4. Check if such a row exists: If the table data has a row that meets these conditions, then our claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n   After following these steps, we can find the relevant row at index 0 in the table. The pitcher in that row is \"Jim Maloney (2) Marshall Bridges\", and the inn is \"7th\". So, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find relevant columns\", \"Search data for matching rows\", \"Check if such a row exists\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"inn\"}]\n}",
