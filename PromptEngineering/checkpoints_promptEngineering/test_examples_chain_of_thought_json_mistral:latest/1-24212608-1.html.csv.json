Check if there are multiple matching rows: If there are multiple rows with the same conditions, we will have to compare other related factors to determine which one fits best with the claim (for example, considering the episode number or broadcast date). But in this case, there is only one row that matches both conditions (row 6), so we don't need to proceed to step 5.\n\n5. Compare the rows: If there were multiple matching rows, we would compare the episodes and/or broadcast dates to determine which one fits best with the claim. In this case, since there is only one matching row, it means that 'nihal' is indeed the most popular radio 1 presenter for the broadcast that has 9.73 million viewers.\n\nNow, let me provide you the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Find rows related to the claim\",\n    \"Check if there are multiple matching rows\",\n    (if multiple rows) \"Compare the rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"radio 1 presenter\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis JSON object explains the reasoning process and provides the final answer along with relevant cells that were used in determining the result.",
