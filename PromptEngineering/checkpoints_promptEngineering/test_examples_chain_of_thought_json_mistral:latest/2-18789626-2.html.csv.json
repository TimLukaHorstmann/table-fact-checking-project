In the provided table, Attica's team is \"red ramblers\" and it's city is also \"Attica\". The city of West Lafayette isn't explicitly mentioned in the table but we know that the schools are \"harrison (west lafayette)\" and \"mccutcheon\", both located in the county of \"79 tippecanoe\" which is a part of the city of Lafayette. Therefore, the teams from West Lafayette are the \"raiders\" and \"mavericks\".\n\n2. Determine when each team joined and left. By looking at the \"year joined\" and \"year left\" columns for each team, we can see that the \"red ramblers\" joined in 1947 and left in 1966, while the \"raiders\" joined in 1970 and are still active as of the provided data (there is no year left for them).\n\n3.
