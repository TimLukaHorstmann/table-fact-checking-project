    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the answer:\n\n1. First, understand the claim: The claim states that no game on June 18 drew a crowd of more than or equal to 20000 people.\n\n2. Identify the relevant columns from the table: The relevant columns are \"date\" (to filter for games on June 18) and \"crowd\" (to check if the crowd is greater than or equal to 20000).\n\n3. Filter the data based on the date: From the table, there are six rows of data, but we only need to focus on those where the date is June 18, 1938. In this case, there are two such rows (geelong vs hawthorn and st kilda vs melbourne).\n\n4. Check the crowd size for each game: For each of these two games, check the \"crowd\" column to see if it is greater than or equal to 20000. If either one is, then the claim would be false.\n\n5. Compare with the data: In the given table, the crowd for both geelong vs hawthorn and st kilda vs melbourne is less than 20000, specifically 7000 and 14000 respectively. Since none of the crowds are greater than or equal to 20000, the claim is true.\n\nNow, here is the output in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim: Check if any game on June 18 drew a crowd of more than or equal to 20000.\",\n    \"Identify relevant columns: date and crowd\",\n    \"Filter data based on date to focus on games played on June 18\",\n    \"Check the crowd size for each game to see if it is greater than or equal to 20000\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n  ]\n}",
