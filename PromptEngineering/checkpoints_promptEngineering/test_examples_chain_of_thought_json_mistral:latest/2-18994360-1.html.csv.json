    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditions in the claim: points < 54, draw < 4, place < 10, and song = \"eu mesmo\"\n2. Look for the relevant columns in the table: points, draw, place, singer (since we're looking for a specific song)\n3. Iterate through each row in the data section to find matches for the conditions:\n   - For the first six rows, all conditions are not met because their points, draw, and/or place values exceed the specified thresholds or their singer doesn't match \"eu mesmo\".\n   - On the seventh row, the points (63) and place (4) values don't meet the conditions, but the singer is incorrect.\n   - On the eighth row, the points (95), draw (8), and place (1) values exceed the specified thresholds, but the singer matches \"eu mesmo\".\n   - On the ninth row, the draw (9) value doesn't meet the condition, and the place (5) value is within the threshold but the points (54) and song (\"pedro migu\u00e9is\" instead of \"eu mesmo\") don't match.\n   - On the tenth row, the singer doesn't match \"eu mesmo\", so we can eliminate it from consideration.\n4.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the claim:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns: Since we are checking a singer's song and its place, we need to focus on the 'singer', 'song', and 'place' columns.\n\n2. Find the row of \"elaisa\": To check if \"elaisa\" is in the first place, we need to find her row by searching for the singer column with a value of \"elaisa\". The row index containing this value will be relevant.\n\n3. Identify the song and place: Once we have found the correct row, look at the values of the 'song' and 'place' columns in that row to see if they match the claim (i.e., \"ai a noite\" and 1). The values will determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n\n4. Determine the answer: If both the song and place match the claim, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow let's look at the table to find \"elaisa\" in the 'singer' column:\n\n- From row 5 onwards, we can see \"elaisa\".\n\nLet's find the song and place for that row:\n\n- The 'song' for this row is \"ai a noite\", as found at row index 5.\n- The 'place' for this row is 6, as found at row index 5.\n\nSince the song matches the claim but the place (6) does not match the claim (1), the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the relevant columns: singer, song, and place.\",\n    \"Search for 'elaisa' in the singer column to find its row index.\",\n    \"Look up the song and place values in the found row.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"singer\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\" }\n  ]\n}",
