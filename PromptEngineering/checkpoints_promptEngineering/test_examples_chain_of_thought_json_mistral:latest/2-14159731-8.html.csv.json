Find the relevant data for Montreal's games: Search through the \"data\" array to find rows where the value of the \"home\" column is \"Montreal\".\n3. Check the date of Montreal's games: Within each row found in step 2, check if the value of the \"date\" column matches March 6.\n4. Determine if Montreal was a visitor or host: If the current row from step 2 has a different team name than Montreal in the \"home\" column, then that team is the host, and Montreal is the visitor.\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to look through the table data row by row. The column of interest is \"home\", which tells us who is the host team (home) and who is the visiting team (away).\n2. Iterate through each row in the table data starting from the first one. Compare the values of the \"home\" column with the desired team, in this case Montreal.\n3. Check if any of the rows have Montreal as the home team, since the claim is about a date before March 6 and Montreal wasn't the home team on that date.\n4. If we find Montreal as the home team, it means that Montreal was not the visitor before March 6, making the claim false. If we don't find Montreal as the home team in any row, then Montreal must have been the visitor before March 6, making the claim true.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check for 'Montreal' in the 'home' column\",\n    \"Compare rows until March 5 and check if Montreal is present as home team\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: After checking all the rows until March 5, we don't find Montreal as the home team.
