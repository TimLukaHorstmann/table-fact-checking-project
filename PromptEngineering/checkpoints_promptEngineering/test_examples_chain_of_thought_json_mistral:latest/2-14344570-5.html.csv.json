The 'columns' key contains an array of column names, and the 'data' key contains an array of arrays that represent the rows of the table.\n\n2. Identify the claim we are trying to verify. The claim is \"the philadelphia flyer tie the colorado avalanche on january 4, 1996\". However, there is no direct column for date in this table. We need to find if the table provides enough information to make a determination.\n\n3. Examine the columns present in the table. The only potential match for the opponent's team name might be the 'opponent' column. But since there are multiple games played against each team, we can't determine the exact game just by this column.\n\n4. Look for another column that could help us identify specific games. Since the data provided includes scores, it is possible to compare them with the scores of other games between these teams to find a match. But without knowing the exact date when each game was played, we can't definitively confirm or refute the claim.\n\n5. Final answer: Based on the information available in this table, it is not possible to verify if \"the philadelphia flyer tie the colorado avalanche on january 4, 1996\".
