Finally, if we find at least one instance where a team had a winning streak of at least 6 games starting on June 20, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nTo determine this, I will search the data for instances where the number of consecutive wins (losses reversed) is more than or equal to 6 and check if the first game of that streak occurred on June 20.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- [17] (date: june 16, loss: escobar (5 - 8), row_index: 34)\n- [18] (date: june 18, win: fassero (6 - 3), row_index: 35)\n- [20] (date: june 20, win: carpenter (6 - 6), row_index: 37)\n- [21] (date: june 21, win: moehler (4 - 4), row_index: 38)\n- [22] (date: june 22, win: nomo (2 - 7), row_index: 39)\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
