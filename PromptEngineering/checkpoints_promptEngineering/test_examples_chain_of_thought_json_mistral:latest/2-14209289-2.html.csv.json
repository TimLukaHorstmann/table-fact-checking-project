This will be the row where the visitor team is \"montreal\" and the home team is \"pittsburgh\". In the given table, this happens on October 15.\n2. Next, check Pittsburgh's record before the match with Montreal. To do this, we need to find a row where the date is prior to October 15 (since the earliest match in the table is older than October 15). In the given table, the earliest match is on October 6.\n3. Check the \"record\" column of the row where the date is October 6. The value of the \"record\" for Pittsburgh on this day is \"0 - 0 - 1\".\n4. Now, check the \"record\" column of the row where the date is October 15 (after the defeat of Montreal). The value of the \"record\" for Pittsburgh on this day is \"2 - 0 - 2\".\n5.

Check the games in the table to see if Montreal was the visiting team and the result of the game led to a record of 3 wins, 0 losses, and 2 ties (3-0-2) before October 15. We need to examine the date of each game.\n\n3. Iterate through the data in the table, comparing the 'visitor' and 'record' columns for Montreal's matches. Note that we are looking for a game with a record of 3-0-2 where Montreal is the visitor, and the date of the game must be before October 15.\n\n4. Find the row (game) corresponding to October 15. The team visiting Pittsburgh in this game is Montreal, but its record at that point is 2-0-2, not 3-0-2. This means we have found a game where Montreal was the visitor after October 15 with a record of 2-0-2, but no game before October 15 with a 3-0-2 record.\n\n5. Since we haven't found any game fulfilling the conditions in the table before October 15, it means that Montreal was not the visitor in the game leading to a 3-0-2 record before October 15.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team for which we need to find a game before October 15 with a specific record\",\n    \"Check each game's visitor and record columns, ensuring the date of the game is before October 15\",\n    \"Find a game where Montreal was the visitor, but the result did not lead to a 3-0-2 record before October 15\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
