Check if the table contains any data related to the artist Maggie Toal and the song \"feed him with love\".\n\n3. Look through the 'data' array in the provided table to find the row containing the required information (artist = Maggie Toal and song = feed him with love).\n\n4. If found, compare the 'draw' value of that row with 7 to determine if it matches or not.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Find data for artist Maggie Toal and song feed him with love\", \"Compare draw value with 7\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"artist\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"draw\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
