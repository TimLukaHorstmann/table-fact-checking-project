Understand the table structure: The table presents a categorization of responses to a question, with each row representing a different category and each column representing a specific individual. Each cell contains a percentage corresponding to the number of respondents who fall into that category for that individual.\n\n3. Find the relevant row: To find out if 1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George Bush, we need to look at the row corresponding to \"George H. W. Bush\".\n\n4. Determine the percentage of \"no opinion\": In this table, the percentage of \"no opinion\" for George H. W. Bush is given as 1%.\n\n5.
