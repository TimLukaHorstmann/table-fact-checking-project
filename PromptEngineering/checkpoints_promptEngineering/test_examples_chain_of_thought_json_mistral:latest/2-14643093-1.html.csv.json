Find Tian Pengfei's rank in 2008/09 and 2012/13: We need to look for rows where the date matches with the years given (2008/09 and 2012/13) and the ranking information in the \"data\" array is related to Tian Pengfei. However, the table does not provide any explicit ranking data for each year, only results like \"a\", \"lq\", \"qr\", etc., which can be interpreted as different stages reached in tournaments but not actual rankings.\n\n3. Check if it is possible to determine the claim without explicit rankings: To find out if Tian Pengfei was 11 ranks higher in one year than another, we can look for the number of tournaments he reached further (in terms of stages) in those years. If he consistently reaches deeper stages in one year compared to the other, it could be interpreted as being a higher rank.\n\n4. Analyze the data: In 2008/09, Tian Pengfei's results show \"a\" (which can be assumed as reaching the final), and in 2012/13, his results show \"lq\", which could mean he lost in the quarterfinals.

For tennis tournaments, this can be represented by the furthest round they reach (e.g., if they reach the quarterfinals in one tournament and the second round in another, their best finish would be the quarterfinals).\n\n3. Check each relevant row: Go through all the rows to find Tian's results. If we find a result that suggests reaching a round further than the second round, mark it as \"best finish\"; if not, continue checking other rounds until the second round or exhaust all possibilities in the given table.\n\n4.

Count the number of \"lq\" instances in the data column for the specified row: In this case, there is one instance of \"lq\".\n3. Check if there are any other rows with more \"lq\" instances than the specified row: To do this, iterate through all the rows and count the \"lq\" instances for each year.\n4. After checking all the rows, compare the number of \"lq\" instances in 2010/11 (row_index 5) with the counts from other years: If there are no other years with more than one instance of \"lq\", then the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the year for which we need to count the number of 'lq' instances.\",\n    \"Count the number of 'lq' instances in the data column for the specified row.\",\n    \"Check if there are any other rows with more 'lq' instances than the specified row.\",\n    \"After checking all the rows, compare the number of 'lq' instances in 2010/11 (row_index 5) with the counts from other years.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"columns[5]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
