Understand the structure of the table: The table provides data about various football managers, including their rank, name, runner-up count, years won, and clubs won.\n\n3. Find the rows corresponding to Ernst Happel and Helenio Herrera: Using the \"name\" column, we can find the rows that contain the names \"ernst happel\" and \"helenio herrera\". For Ernst Happel, the row index is 8, and for Helenio Herrera, the row index is 17.\n\n4. Compare the ranks: To compare the ranks, we look at the rank column in the respective rows. The rank of Ernst Happel (row 8) is 4, while the rank of Helenio Herrera (row 17) is 9.\n\n5. Determine the answer to the claim: Since Ernst Happel's rank (4) is less than Helenio Herrera's rank (9), it means that Ernst Happel outranks Helenio Herrera.
