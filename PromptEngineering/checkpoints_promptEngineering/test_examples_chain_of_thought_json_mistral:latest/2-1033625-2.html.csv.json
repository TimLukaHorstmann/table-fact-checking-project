To check if the claim \"the score for march 24 1982 was 1 - 1\" is true or false, we need to find the row that corresponds to this date in the table.\n3. The table doesn't contain any information about dates other than years. However, since the match on March 24, 1982, would most likely be associated with the year 1982, we will search for any matches from 1982 to find a possible match on that date.\n4. We see that there is only one row with a match played in 1982 that corresponds to March (the 6th row, as it's the 6th match of the entire dataset and March has 31 days).\n5. The score for that match is given as \"2 - 0\" in the table.\n6.
