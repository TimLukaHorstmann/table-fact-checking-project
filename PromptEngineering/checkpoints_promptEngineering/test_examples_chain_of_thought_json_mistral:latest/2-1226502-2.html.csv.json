Check the data for relevant years: Start with the first row, since it contains the earliest year (1988). Compare each row's entrant value to \"leyton house racing\".

Compare and analyze the data in the table: We observe that the team \"leyton house\" (and its variations) has two distinct chassis models over the years - march 881 and leyton house cg901/cg911. However, we don't see any row where the 'year' is earlier than 1989 with the leyton house cg901/cg911 chassis model.\n\n4. Check for continuity: Since there are two distinct chassis models and none of them can be considered as continuously used across all years, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the driver for whom we want to check if the chassis stays the same over the years.\",\n    \"Verify if there's a single chassis used by the team across different years.\",\n    \"Compare and analyze the data in the table.\",\n    \"Check for continuity.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"entrant\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    // ... and so on for all relevant cells up to the last row.\n  ]\n}\n```",
