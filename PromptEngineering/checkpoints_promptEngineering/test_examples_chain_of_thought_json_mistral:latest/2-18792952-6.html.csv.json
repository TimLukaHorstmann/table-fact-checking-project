Iterate through each row of data in the table: We will check if Dan Povenmire is the director for any show with the titles \"Museum Scream\" or \"My Generation g-g-Gap\".\n\n4. Compare each director to Dan Povenmire and each title to \"Museum Scream\" or \"My Generation g-g-Gap\": For every row, we will compare the value in the \"director\" column with Dan Povenmire's name (case sensitive), and the value in the \"title\" column with either \"Museum Scream\" or \"My Generation g-g-Gap\". If both conditions are met for a specific row, that means Dan Povenmire directed that particular show.\n\n5.
