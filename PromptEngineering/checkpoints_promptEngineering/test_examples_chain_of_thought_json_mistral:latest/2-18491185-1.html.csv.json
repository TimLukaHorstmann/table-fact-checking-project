Compare the episodes and dates: In this table, the first column is \"episode\" and the second column is \"date\". For each row, compare the value at the first index of the subarray (the episode) with the string \"one\", and the value at the second index of the subarray (the date) with the string \"7 / 21 / 08\".\n\n4.

If none of the rows meet this condition, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells would be empty since we're not determining which specific row the claim corresponds to.
