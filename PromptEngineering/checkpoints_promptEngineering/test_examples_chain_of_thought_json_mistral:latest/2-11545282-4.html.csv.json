Check if their years for the Jazz overlap by comparing the 'years for jazz' column between these two rows. To compare the years, we will parse the values in this column as date ranges (using a reasonable assumption about the format of the year range, e.g., 'YYYY - YYYY'). In this case, Darryl Dawkins played from 1987 to 1988 and Paul Dawkins played from 1979 to 1980.\n\n3.

From the table, we find two players with the last name Dawkins: \"adrian dantley\" and \"darryl dawkins\".\n2. Check if they are guards. Both Adrian Dantley (position: guard - forward) and Darryl Dawkins (position: center) are listed as guards or positions related to guard (forward). However, only Darryl Dawkins is specifically listed as a guard.\n3. Verify their tenure with the Jazz. We find that Adrian Dantley played from \"1979 - 86\" and Darryl Dawkins played from \"1987 - 88\".\n4. Determine if their tenures overlap. Since the range of Adrian Dantley's tenure (1979 - 86) includes the first year of Darryl Dawkins' tenure (1987), we can conclude that their tenures do overlap if we consider Adrian as still being on the team in 1987.\n5. However, since the table only lists specific years for each player without mentioning that a player was still with the Jazz at the end of their listed range, it's reasonable to assume that a player left the team at the end of their listed year unless there's explicit information stating otherwise. In this case, there is no such information for Adrian Dantley, so we can conclude that Adrian Dantley was not with the Jazz in 1987 when Darryl Dawkins joined.\n6. Since the players are guards and their tenures do not overlap according to the assumption made in step 5, we can now check if their tenures truly do not overlap without assuming they were both on the team at the same time. To do this, compare the first year of Adrian Dantley's tenure (1979) with the last year of Darryl Dawkins' tenure (1988).

The middle year for Darryl is (1987+1988)/2 = 1988.5. Since we cannot have half years in the data, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 1988. The end year for Paul is 1980.\n5.
