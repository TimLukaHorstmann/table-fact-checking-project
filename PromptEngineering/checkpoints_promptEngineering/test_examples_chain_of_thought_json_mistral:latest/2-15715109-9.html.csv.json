Identify the key information required to verify the claim: The claim states that a player played for the 'flin flon bombers (sjhl)' and another player played for the 'university of north dakota (ncaa)'. We need to find the teams each player is associated with in the table.\n2. Check the team names given in the claim against the team names in the table: The table lists the teams under the \"19631964 team\" column. The claim mentions 'flin flon bombers (sjhl)' and 'university of north dakota (ncaa)'.\n3. Compare the team names from step 2 with those in the table to determine if any players are associated with matching teams: In the table, we see that only one player is associated with the 'flin flon bombers (sjhl)', which is 'pat rupp' (row index: 16). No player is associated with 'university of north dakota (ncaa)' in the given data.\n4. If any players match, check if those players are the only ones that meet the condition specified in the claim: Since we found a matching team for 'flin flon bombers (sjhl)', and no matching team for 'university of north dakota (ncaa)', there is only one player who matches the first part of the claim (pat rupp). No other players match the conditions specified in the claim.\n5. Based on the above steps, compare our findings with the claim to determine if it is true or false: The claim states that \"the player that play for the flin flon bomber (sjhl) be pat rupp and the player that play for the university of north dakota (ncaa) be donald ross\". Since 'pat rupp' matches with 'flin flon bombers (sjhl)' and no other players match any of the conditions in the claim, the first part of the claim is true.
