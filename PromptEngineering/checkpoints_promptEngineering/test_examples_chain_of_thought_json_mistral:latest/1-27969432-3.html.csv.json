These are \"original air date\" and all other columns except for \"no in series\", as we are not interested in the episode number but rather the total count of episodes that match this criteria.\n\n2. Next, filter the data to find only the rows where the \"original air date\" matches August 1, 2011. In our table, there are two such episodes: [4] and [14].\n\n3. Now, identify the writers of these episodes. For the first episode (row 4), the writer is \"mark haber & julie h\\u00e3bert\". For the second episode (row 14), the writer is \"michael zinberg & elizabeth benjamin & dee johnson\".\n\n4. Since the claim states that we are looking for episodes written by Dee Johnson, we need to find out if there is more than one episode matching this criteria on August 1, 2011. In our filtered data, only the second episode (row 14) has Dee Johnson as a writer.\n\n5. Finally, compare the total number of episodes written by Dee Johnson to those written by other writers who also have an episode airing on August 1, 2011. Since there is only one episode written by Dee Johnson and multiple episodes written by other writers (in this case, Mark Haber, Julie H\\u00e3bert, Michael Zinberg, Elizabeth Benjamin), it follows that the number of episodes written by Dee Johnson airing on August 1, 2011 is not the lowest.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns for filtering\",\n    \"Filter data to find episodes aired on August 1, 2011\",\n    \"Find writers of filtered episodes\",\n    \"Compare the number of episodes written by Dee Johnson to those written by other writers who also have an episode airing on August 1, 2011\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original air date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"written by\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"original air date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"written by\" }\n  ]\n}",
