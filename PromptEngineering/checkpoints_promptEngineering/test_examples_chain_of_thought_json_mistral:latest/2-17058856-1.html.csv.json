Verify that this goal is indeed by Vladimir Malenkikh to confirm the score at that moment.\n   - The second row also has a value of 'vladimir malenkikh (1) (pp)' in the goal column, which indicates that Vladimir Malenkikh scored once with power play assistance.\n\n4. Determine the score at the time when Vladimir Malenkikh scored by examining the score column of the second row.\n   - The value '0 - 2 met' in the score column indicates that the score was 0 for the other team and 2 for \"met\" at the time of the goal.\n\n5.

Examine the table data for a row containing the necessary conditions:\n   - A row where the \"time\" column matches 18:27 and the \"team\" column matches 'met'\n\n3. Determine the score before the event by finding the previous row of the same team (ordered chronologically):\n   - Since there are multiple rows for team 'met', find the previous row with the same team name\n   - In this case, it is the 4th row with a score of \"0 - 1 met\"\n\n4. Examine the initial score to determine whether it matches the condition specified in the claim (score before the event was 0):\n   - The initial score is indeed 0 (since we found that the previous row's score is \"0 - 1 met\")\n\n5. Determine the final score after the event by examining the relevant row:\n   - In this case, the score of the selected row is \"0 - 2 met\"\n\n6. Compare the final and initial scores to determine whether they meet the condition specified in the claim (score difference should be 1):\n   - The score difference between the previous and the selected row is indeed 1\n\n7.
