Search for any rows where the \"team\" (represented by \"h/a\") is \"Manchester United\". Since there's no such team in the provided data, we cannot find a row related to Manchester United.\n3. Check if the claim provides a specific date: 20 February, 1904. Since we do not have any date associated with Manchester United, we cannot compare the attendance on that date directly.\n4. However, the table does contain data about other teams' match attendance figures for different dates. We should compare the attendance figure mentioned in the claim (20 February, 1904) with the highest attendance recorded in the table to determine if it is the highest or not.\n5. To find the highest attendance, we need to iterate through all the rows and check each attendance value in the \"attendance\" column. We can then compare this max value with the attendance figure mentioned in the claim (22051).\n6. If the max attendance from the table matches or exceeds the attendance on 20 February, 1904 (22051), then the claim would be false since we do not have a Manchester United match on that date and the highest attendance in the table is higher than the claimed attendance.
