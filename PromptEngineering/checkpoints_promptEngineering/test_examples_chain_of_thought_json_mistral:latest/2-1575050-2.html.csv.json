    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the structure of the table, noting that it has two main sections: columns (headers) and data.\n2. Check the headers to understand what each column represents - in particular, we are interested in the \"gold\", \"silver\", and \"bronze\" columns as they represent medals won.\n3. Check the values in the table against the claim - the claim is about the total count of bronze medals being 2.\n4. Inspect each row to see if there's a non-zero value in the \"bronze\" column, since we are looking for countries or the total that have won bronze medals.\n5. Observe that only four rows (excluding the 'total' row) have any data, and the 'bronze' values in these rows are 0, 0, 1, and 1 respectively.\n6. Summing up the 'bronze' values from all rows excluding the total, we get 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.\n7. Compare this sum with the claim - the claim is that the total for bronze should be 2, and indeed it is (2).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Understand column meaning\",\n    \"Check values against claim\",\n    \"Inspect each row's 'bronze' value\",\n    \"Sum 'bronze' values from all rows except total\",\n    \"Compare the sum with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\" }\n  ]\n}",
