Identify the claim's components: The claim states that only Mike Gravel has received loans of 2q (loans_received) with an amount of 10000, and he has the least money raised (money_raised) among all candidates in the table.\n\n2. Find the relevant rows for each component: For \"loans_received\", look for rows that have a value greater than or equal to 10000 in the \"loans received , 2q\" column. For \"money_raised\", look for the row with the least amount in the \"money raised , 2q\" column.\n\n3. Compare the identified rows: If there is only one row that matches the condition for both components, then it will be Mike Gravel's row, and the claim will be true. If there are multiple rows that match either or both conditions, then the claim will be false.\n\n4. Examine the table data: The table contains data for 9 candidates, each represented as a row.\n\n- For \"loans_received\", only Mike Gravel's row has a value greater than or equal to 10000. It has \"- 10000\". Since this value is equivalent to 10000 (as there is a negative sign), it matches the condition.\n- For \"money_raised\", Dennis Kucinich has the least amount, with 757035. Mike Gravel has 2451180, which is greater than Dennis's amount.\n\n5. Based on the comparison: The identified row for \"loans_received\" does not match the condition for having the least money raised among all candidates.
