    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the district in question from the claim: \"virginia 11th\".\n2. Check if the table contains a row with the district name as specified in step 1. In this case, the table does contain a row with that district name (\"virginia 11th\").\n3. Examine the fourth column of the identified row to determine the successor date. The value for the \"successor\" column is \"john robertson ( aj )\", so we need to find another row with the same \"successor\" value in order to find the \"date successor seated\".\n4. Check if the table contains a row with the identified successor's name as specified in step 3. In this case, the table does contain another row with that successor name (\"john robertson ( aj )\").\n5. Examine the fifth column of the found row to determine the date when the successor was seated. The value for the \"date successor seated\" column is \"december 8 , 1834\".\n6. Compare the result from step 5 with the given claim's expected date: \"december 1, 1834\". The dates are not equal.\n7. Since the expected date and found date do not match, the final answer is FALSE.\n\nHere's my output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify district in claim\",\n    \"Check if table contains identified district\",\n    \"Examine successor date for the identified district\",\n    \"Find another row with the same successor's name\",\n    \"Examine the date when the successor was seated\",\n    \"Compare found date with expected date\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"successor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date successor seated\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date successor seated\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
