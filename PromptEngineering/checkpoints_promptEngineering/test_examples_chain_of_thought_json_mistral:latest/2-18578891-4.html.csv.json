    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be checked: The claim states that \"david payne with united state have a time of 13.21\".\n2. Identify the structure of the data table: The table has six columns - rank, lane, athlete, nationality, time, and notes. It also contains an array of arrays as its 'data' field.\n3. Search for relevant rows in the table: To check if \"david payne\" with \"united states\" has a time of 13.21, we need to find the row where the athlete's name is \"david payne\" and the nationality is \"united states\".\n4. Check each row in the table for a match: Iterate through each row in the 'data' array to find the matching athlete and nationality.\n5. Compare the found data with the claim: If a row is found where the 'athlete' matches \"david payne\" and the 'nationality' matches \"united states\", then compare the 'time' value of that row (the fifth column) with 13.21.\n6. Output the final answer in the required format: If a matching row is found and its 'time' value equals 13.21, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE. The relevant cells would be the row_index of the matched cell and all four columns from that row (rank, lane, athlete, nationality).\n\nBased on this reasoning, here's the output in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Understand table structure\",\n    \"Find relevant rows\",\n    \"Iterate through each row and compare\",\n    \"Check if found data matches claim\",\n    \"Output final answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"lane\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"athlete\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
