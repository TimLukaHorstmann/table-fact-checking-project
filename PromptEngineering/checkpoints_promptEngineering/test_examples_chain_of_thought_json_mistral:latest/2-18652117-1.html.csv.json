Extract relevant data from the table: Look for rows where the player's name matches \"tony lorick\" and the team's name matches \"oakland\", and check if the position column shows 'rb' (running back).\n\n3. Compare the extracted data with the claim: If the data found in step 2 shows that \"tony lorick\" is a player for \"oakland\" and his position is 'rb', then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Find row_index 7, which contains the data for \"tony lorick\".\n- The columns are \"pick\", \"team\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"college\". In this row, we are interested in the \"team\" and \"position\" columns.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim, Extract relevant data from table, Compare extracted data with claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the column names to filter the data based on the claim: pick (which we don't need), team, player, and position are irrelevant for this claim; only college and the combined information of team and player matter.\n2. Check the college of each player to find their respective teams:\n   - Jack Connan (Boston College) plays for Boston\n   - Pete Beathard (USC) plays for Kansas City\n   - Matt Snell (Ohio State) is the target player for this claim\n   - Bob Brown (Nebraska) plays for Denver\n   - Carl Elle (Minnesota) plays for Buffalo\n   - Scott Appleton (Texas) plays for Houston\n   - Tony Lorick (Arizona State) plays for Oakland\n   - Ted Davis (Georgia Tech) plays for San Diego\n3. Check the college of the target player (Ohio State): Matt Snell's college is Ohio State.\n4. Find out which team Matt Snell plays for: Since he comes from Ohio State, we search through the table to find the row with \"ohio state\" in the 'college' column and 'player' corresponding to 'Matt Snell'.\n5. Check if Matt Snell is found playing for a team: In the 3rd row, Matt Snell is listed as playing for New York.\n6. Compare the claim with the filtered data: The claim is \"the player from ohio state play for new york\". After filtering and comparing, it's evident that the claim holds true since Matt Snell from Ohio State plays for New York.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant columns for the claim\",\n    \"Check the college of each player to find their respective teams\",\n    \"Find the target player (Matt Snell) and his team from the table\",\n    \"Compare the filtered data with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\" }\n  ]\n}",
