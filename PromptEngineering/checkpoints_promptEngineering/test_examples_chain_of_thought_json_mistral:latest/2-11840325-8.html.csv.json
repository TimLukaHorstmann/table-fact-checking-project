    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim details: The claim mentions a specific year (2012) and specifies that Oakland Raiders lose to Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15 - 0.\n\n2. Find the relevant rows in the table based on the specified year (2012): There are two rows in the data array where the year is 2012. They correspond to the indexes 3 and 6.\n\n3. Check if either of these rows meet the other requirements mentioned in the claim:\n   - Row with index 3 has the Raider's win over Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, not a loss.\n   - Row with index 6 has the Raiders winning against Chiefs at Oco Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium and also not with the result of 15 - 0.\n\n4. Since none of the rows meet all the conditions mentioned in the claim, we can conclude that the given claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim details, Find relevant rows based on specified year, Check if any row meets all the conditions\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\" }\n  ]\n}",
