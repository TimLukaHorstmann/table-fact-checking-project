Since he won a leg with 45 points, it means he played at least one more leg where he scored less than 45 points, so we don't know his exact number of 180s.\n3. However, we can find the total number of 180s for all players and compare it to Denis Ovens' total 180s. If the total number of 180s is less than or equal to 18, then it means that any player could have had 45 points (or more) in a leg without having more than 18 180s.\n4. Calculate the total number of 180s for all players by finding the sum of '180' values in the data where the column name is 'score'.\n5. Compare this calculated total with 18 to determine if it's true or false that a player with 45 points in a leg would have more than 18 180s.\n\nanswer: FALSE\nrelevant_cells: [\n  { \"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n]",
