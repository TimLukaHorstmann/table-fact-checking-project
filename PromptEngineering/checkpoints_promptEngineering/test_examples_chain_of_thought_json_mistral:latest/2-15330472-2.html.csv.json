    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, identify the column names to search for the requested data: rank, prev, player, rating, change.\n2. From the table, find the row corresponding to Viswanathan Anand (row_index 0).\n3. Check the 'rating' value in that row: 2803.\n4. Compare the 'rating' value with the required minimum value of 2753. Since 2803 > 2753, Viswanathan Anand meets this condition.\n5. Check the 'prev' value in that row: 2.\n6. Compare the 'prev' value with the required maximum value of 3 (as we are looking for values less than 4). Since 2 < 3, Viswanathan Anand also meets this condition.\n7. Finally, check if the 'change' value in that row is \"+ 4\". Since it is indeed \"+ 4\", Viswanathan Anand meets this final condition as well.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify column names for search.\",\n    \"Find the row of Viswanathan Anand.\",\n    \"Check if the 'rating' is greater than 2753.\",\n    \"Check if the 'prev' value is less than 4.\",\n    \"Check if the 'change' value is + 4.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rating\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prev\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"change\" }\n  ]\n}",
