These can be found in the same row (row_index=21) under their respective column names.\n3. Verify if the team with car number 99, \"99 gainsco / bob stallings racing\", is present in either of these columns. If it's present in either column, then the claim can be evaluated.\n4. If the team is present in the pole position column (column name: Pole Position), then the claim that they are in the pole position at round 10 is valid.\n5. Similarly, if the team is present in the fastest lap column (column name: Fastest Lap), then the claim that they have the fastest lap at round 10 is also valid.\n6.
