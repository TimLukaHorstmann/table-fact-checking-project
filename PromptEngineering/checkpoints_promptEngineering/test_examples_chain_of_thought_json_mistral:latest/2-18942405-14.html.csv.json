Find the row corresponding to the school in question: In our table, we see that Andrean is located in the first row.\n3. Check the column corresponding to the enrollment: In the first row, there is a value under the \"enrollment\" column.\n4. Compare the claim value with the cell value: The value in the first row and third column (\"enrollment\") of our table is 587, which matches the claimed value.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the school to be checked\", \"Find the corresponding row\", \"Check the enrollment column for that row\", \"Compare claim value with cell value\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}]\n}",
