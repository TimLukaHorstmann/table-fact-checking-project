List out these tied players with their respective scores and the places they are tied at:\n   - Isao Aoki (Japan), score 71 (+1) in row index 3, place t3\n   - David Graham (Australia), score 71 (+1) in row index 4, place t3\n   - Howard Clark (England), score 72 (+2) in row index 10, place t9\n   - Ben Crenshaw (United States), score 72 (+2) in row index 11, place t9\n   - David Jagger (England), score 72 (+2) in row index 12, place t9\n   - Mark James (England), score 72 (+2) in row index 13, place t9\n   - Greg Norman (Australia), score 72 (+2) in row index 14, place t9\n   - Arnold Palmer (United States), score 72 (+2) in row index 15, place t9\n   - Bill Rogers (United States), score 72 (+2) in row index 16, place t9\n   - Sam Torrance (Scotland), score 72 (+2) in row index 17, place t9\n\n5. Since there are players tied with a score of 72 and the table does not provide information about the year of the tournament, we cannot definitively answer whether it is TRUE or FALSE that in the 1981 Open Championship the win score was 72, with Isao Aoki and David Graham tying for this score.\n\nAs a responsible and honest AI assistant, I don't make claims without sufficient evidence. However, based on the data provided, it seems plausible that in some tournament where the players listed above tied for the lead with a score of 72 (+/- strokes), there might have been an opportunity for more than one player to win.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant data from table\",\n    \"Check if any rows indicate a tie in the 'place' column (t3 or t9)\",\n    \"List players tied with score 72 and their respective places\",\n    \"Cannot definitively answer claim about the 1981 Open Championship without year information\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"country\" }\n  ]\n}",
