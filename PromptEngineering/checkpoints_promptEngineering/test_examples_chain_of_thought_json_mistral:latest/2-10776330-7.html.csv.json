This can be done by going through each row of data and taking note of the 'crowd' column value.\n2. Once we have the crowd sizes for all matches, we need to compare them to determine which venue had the highest crowd participation.\n3. In this case, we can see that the MCG has a crowd size of 49678. We then compare this with other crowd sizes in the table.\n4. The other crowd sizes are: 13000, 15000, 28290, 18683, and 14500. Comparing these to the MCG's 49678, we can see that none of them are greater than 49678.\n5.
