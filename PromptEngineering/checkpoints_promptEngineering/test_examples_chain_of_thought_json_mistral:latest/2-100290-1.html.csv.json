    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim conditions: The claim states that a package with a size of \"pdip - 20\" should occur at least once when EEPROM is less than 128.\n2. Check for rows in the table that meet the first condition (EEPROM < 128). There are three such rows: [0], [1], and [3].\n3. For each row that meets the first condition, check if the package matches \"pdip - 20\". Only one row (row 0) has a package of \"pdip - 20\" for which EEPROM is less than 128.\n4. Since at least one row meets both conditions, it can be inferred that the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the conditions in the claim\",\n    \"Find rows where EEPROM < 128\",\n    \"Check if each row with EEPROM < 128 also has a package of 'pdip - 20'\",\n    \"Since at least one row meets both conditions, infer that the claim is TRUE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"package\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to follow for determining the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the chip in question (at90s1200) within the table's data section.\n2. Note the frequency value associated with the identified chip (12 Mhz).\n3. Filter the table's data to find other chips that have a frequency greater than 12 Mhz.\n4. Check if any of the remaining chips have a smaller frequency than the one we found in step 2.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find at90s1200 within the data\",\n    \"Note its associated frequency (12 Mhz)\",\n    \"Filter the data to find chips with a frequency greater than 12 Mhz\",\n    \"Check if there are any chips in the filtered list that have a smaller frequency\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"frequency\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": *,\n      \"column_name\": \"frequency\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExplanation: The relevant cells are the frequency of at90s1200 (row_index=0, column_name=\"frequency\") and all other frequencies in the table where the chip has a frequency greater than 12 Mhz.
