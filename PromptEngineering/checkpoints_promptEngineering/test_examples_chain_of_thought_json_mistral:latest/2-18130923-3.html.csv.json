Identify the column names for easier reference, as they are used throughout the table:\n    - place\n    - player\n    - country\n    - score\n    - to par\n    - money\n\n2. The claim states that Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are tied for fifth place. To verify this, follow these steps:\n\n3. First, find the rows corresponding to Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson in the table (looking at the \"player\" column).\n    - Row index of Bob Gilder: Find the row where player = \"bob gilder\". The row_index is 5.\n    - Row index of Steven Richardson: Find the row where player = \"steven richardson\". The row_index is 6.\n\n4. Compare their respective scores (looking at the \"score\" column) to determine if they have the same score and are in the same position as stated in the claim.\n    - Bob Gilder's score: From the \"5\"th row, the score is \"73 + 70 + 67 + 73 = 283\".\n    - Steven Richardson's score: From the \"6\"th row, the score is \"70 + 72 + 72 + 69 = 283\".\n\n5. Since both Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson have the same score (283), they are tied for a position. To find their position in the table, look at the \"place\" column. The claim specifically mentions that they are tied for fifth place, so we can verify this by looking for rows where place equals \"t5\".\n    - Both Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson's row indexes (5 and 6) match the \"t5\" position in the table. This indicates that both players indeed tie for fifth place.\n\nNow, here's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify column names\",\n    \"Find rows of Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson\",\n    \"Compare their scores\",\n    \"Check if they are in the 't5' position\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
