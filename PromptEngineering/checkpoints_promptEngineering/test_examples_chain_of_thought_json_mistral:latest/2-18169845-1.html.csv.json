Check if Daniel Boaventura is in this row: Look at the data of the first row (row_index 0) under the \"original s\\u00e3o paulo cast\" column, which corresponds to the role of Gomez Addams.

If there are multiple actors, it means that the claim is false because more than one person was available to play the role in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n3. Since there is only one actor (Nicholas Torres, Gustavo Daneluz, Matheus Lustosa) playing the role of 'pugsley Addams' in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast, it implies that he is the only one who was available to play this role in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n4.
