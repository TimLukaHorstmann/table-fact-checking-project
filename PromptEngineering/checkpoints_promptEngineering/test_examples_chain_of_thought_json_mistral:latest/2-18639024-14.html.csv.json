    "resp": "Here's the reasoning:\n1. Identify the data provided which appears to be a table containing information about female football (soccer) players, with columns such as 'Name', 'Goals Scored', etc., and rows representing each player.\n2. The claim states that \"rebecca tegg be not active in 2009 , 2010 , or 2011\". To verify this, we need to look for any entries related to Rebecca Tegg during these years.\n3. In the table, there are rows representing each player and columns showing their activity during different seasons. The 'Year' column isn't explicitly present in the data provided, but we can infer active years based on the goal-scoring data since players typically score goals during their active seasons.\n4. To determine if Rebecca Tegg was active during 2009, 2010, or 2011, look for her name in relevant rows of the table and search for any goal-scoring entries in these years:\n   - In the 'Name' column, find the row containing \"rebecca tegg\" (row_index = 38)\n5. Analyze the goal-scoring data for Rebecca Tegg:\n   - In the 'Goals Scored' column for her row, there is an entry of \"10\" for the year 2008 and no entries for any other years (2009, 2010, or 2011).\n6.

    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. First, compare the years of activity for each player. The year of activity can be found by looking at the first number in the row (in the 0th column).\n2. From the data provided, Katrina Gorry started her career in 2008, while Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg both also started in 2008.\n3. Since all three players started in the same year, we need to look for other criteria to determine if Katrina Gorry was active after Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg.\n4. The data shows that a player's activity can also be inferred by their last appearance or when they left the team. In this case, it's not explicitly stated, but we can assume that a player who appears later in the list might have been active after others who appear earlier.\n5. Using this assumption, Katrina Gorry appears later in the list than both Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg, which suggests she was active after them.\n6. However, it's important to note that the ordering based on appearance in the list is not definitive proof of when they were actually active. There could be other factors such as promotions, demotions, or changes in teams within the same year that might affect the order in which they appear in this list.\n7. Despite these potential caveats, given the information available and the assumption made about the ordering based on appearance in the list, it's reasonable to conclude that Katrina Gorry was active after Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"0th\"}, {\"row_index\": 132, \"column_name\": \"0th\"}, {\"row_index\": 208, \"column_name\": \"0th\"}]",
