The given table has the following columns: \"season\", \"episode\", \"episisode summary\", \"premier date\", \"external link\", and \"coach\". So, we are looking for the row that contains the coach's name.\n\n2. Scan through the data rows to find a match with the given claim's coach: \"katie kansas\" (Note that the table shows \"killer mike | - |\" for episode 2, but it is clear from the context that this is not the coach of episode 2; instead, it appears to be additional information). However, there is no exact match found for \"katie kansas\".\n\n3. Since we couldn't find an exact match with \"katie kansas\", we need to consider if there are any misspellings or variations in the coach name that might have caused the discrepancy. We can check if any of the column entries contain similar names (e.g., Katie Kansas, K. Kansas, Kate Kansa, etc.). There is no such variation found in the table.\n\n4. At this point, we must conclude that there is no row in the table where the coach's name is \"katie kansas.\"\n\nWith this reasoning in mind, our final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the columns to determine which column contains the coach's name\",\n    \"Scan through the data rows to find a match with the given claim's coach (katie kansas)\",\n    \"Check for any variations or misspellings of the coach name\",\n    \"Conclude that there is no row in the table where the coach's name is 'katie kansas'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
