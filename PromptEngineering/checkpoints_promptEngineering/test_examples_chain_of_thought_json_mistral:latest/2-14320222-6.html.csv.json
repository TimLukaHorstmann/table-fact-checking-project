Find the row number corresponding to game 61 in the table: Game numbers correspond to the first column and are integers, so we look for the row where the first column value equals 61. From the given table, the row index for game 61 is 58.\n\n3. Extract the score (points) for the selected game: The score (points) can be found in the fifth column of the selected row. In this case, it is 84.\n\n4. Determine if the points for the selected game equal or exceed 86: Comparing the points for game 61 (84) to the claimed total (86), we see that it falls short by 2 points. So, game 61 does not have a total of 86 points.\n\n5. Check other rows to find games with a total of 86 points: Since we have already found that game 61 does not have a total of 86 points, we must now look for the other two games with a combined total of 86 points in the table.\n\n   - First, note that the points column values are increasing throughout the table.\n   - Next, find the next row after game 61 (row index 59) and compare its points value to 86: The value at this location is 82.
