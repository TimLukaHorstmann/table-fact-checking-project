Identify the claim conditions: The claim states that we need to find the power output of a locomotive with a wheel arrangement of \"b - b\" built in 1952.\n\n2. Find all rows matching the wheel arrangement condition: There are two rows where the wheel arrangement is \"b - b\". One is at row index 0 and the other is not specified by the table (row indices > 0). However, since the claim specifies that it was built in 1952, we can discard the one without a build date as it doesn't meet this condition.\n\n3. Narrow down to the specific year: From the remaining row (index 0), extract the build date which is \"1948 - 1949\". Since our claim specifies 1952, the data does not match this condition.\n\n4.
