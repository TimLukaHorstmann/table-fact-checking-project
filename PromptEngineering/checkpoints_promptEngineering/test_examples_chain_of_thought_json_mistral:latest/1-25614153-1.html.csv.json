Next, we iterate through each row of the data to find the worship leaders for each song. We store them in a separate set (a collection that only allows unique elements) to avoid duplicates.\n3. After collecting all the worship leaders, we compare the size of this set with the total number of songs. If they are equal, it means each leader is associated with at least one song, and if there's more than one leader across multiple songs, then our claim holds true.\n4. Since the set contains unique elements, if the size of the set equals 3 (the total number of leaders according to the table), it implies that each leader is featured in at least one song, and also each of them appears in multiple songs due to overlapping leadership roles within some songs.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'worship leader' column\",\n    \"Iterate through each row of data to find worship leaders\",\n    \"Store leaders in a set and compare size with total number of songs\",\n    \"Check if size of set equals 3 (total number of leaders) and verify that some leaders appear across multiple songs\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"\n    },\n    // ... and so on for the rest of the rows where 'worship leader' is present\n  ]\n}",
