Find the row in the table that corresponds to Olga Govortsova. The relevant data row index is 0 since the player's name is located at the first row of the \"data\" array.\n3. Extract the year-end ranking for each year from 2007 to 2011 for this player. In this table, the year-end rankings are stored in the last column with a header \"year - end ranking\". The relevant columns are [5,6,7,8,9,10] (as indexed from 0).\n4. Check if the values of these columns for Olga Govortsova increase as we move from 2007 to 2011.\n\nThe final answer can be obtained by comparing the values at the relevant cells and checking whether they form an increasing sequence:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row for Olga Govortsova in the data array\",\n    \"Extract year-end ranking columns for Olga Govortsova (columns 5 to 10)\",\n    \"Check if the values form an increasing sequence\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking 1\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking 2\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking 3\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking 4\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking 5\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps I will follow to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, identify the player's name from the table since it is not provided explicitly in the question. In this case, the player's name is \"olga govortsova\" as the data pertains only to her performance.\n\n2. Next, look for rows that correspond to each year starting from 2007 (inclusive) up to and including 2011 (exclusive).\n\n3. For each year, find the cell under the \"French Open\" column and check if the result is not just \"olympic games\". If it is \"olympic games\", then skip this row as those results don't pertain to Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n4. Compare the found cells for the years 2007 through 2011 with the claim that she advanced to the third round in the French Open 5 year in a row. To do so, check if all of those cells contain \"3r\" or some other value (e.g., \"a\", \"lq\", etc.) that represents her advancing past the second round.\n\nNow, let me provide the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player's name from the table\",\n    \"Look for rows corresponding to each year from 2007 to 2011\",\n    \"Check if the cell under the French Open column for those years is not 'olympic games'\",\n    \"Compare the cells with the claim that she advanced to the third round in the French Open 5 year in a row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"French Open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"French Open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"French Open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"French Open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"French Open\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
