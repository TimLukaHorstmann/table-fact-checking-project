Check if there exists a row with the above two conditions: In this case, the 8th row of the table matches both conditions (since 'venue' = \"glasgow\" and 'year' = \"2007\").\n\n4. Verify if the outcome in that row is equal to 13: The score for the 8th row is given as \"3 - 0 (21 - 18 , 19 - 21 , 21 - 17)\". We need to determine the total score, which can be calculated as the sum of individual game scores. In this case, it's 21 + 18 + 19 + 21 = 79. Therefore, the outcome is not equal to 13.\n\n5.

Loop through each row in the data array of the table.\n3. Check if the value in the 'outcome' column is equal to \"silver\".\n4. Check if the 'score' value, when split by spaces and commas, can be converted to a list of integers and if that list represents a score of \"0 - 3\" (i.e., the first element should be 0 and the second and third elements should both be greater than 1).\n5. Check if the 'venue' value is equal to \"liverpool\".\n6.
