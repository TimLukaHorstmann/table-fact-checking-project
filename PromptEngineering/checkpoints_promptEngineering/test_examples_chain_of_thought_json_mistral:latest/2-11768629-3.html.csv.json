    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the column names to determine which columns might contain the information needed to answer the question. In this case, the relevant columns are \"round\", \"date\", and \"opponent\".\n2. Check if there is a row in the data that has the date \"4 october\" as the value for the \"date\" column. This will help us find the match on October 4th, if it exists. In this table, we do find a row with the date \"4 october\".\n3. Check the value of the \"opponent\" column in the row found above. If it is \"panathinaikos\", then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE. In this table, the opponent for the match on October 4th is \"dnipro\", so the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns: round, date, and opponent\", \"Find the row with 'date' = '4 october',\", \"Check if the value of 'opponent' in the found row is 'panathinaikos'.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the claim:\n\n1. Identify the column names for easier reference:\n   - round, date, opponent, score, attendance, report\n\n2. Check if there exists a row where the attendance matches the one provided in the claim (18843)\n\n3. If such a row exists, check if the opponent also matches the value provided in the claim (panathinaikos) for that specific row\n\n4. Furthermore, check if the round of the match is 'fr' as per the claim\n\nNow, let's find relevant cells:\n- To determine if the attendance is 18843, we need to look at the \"attendance\" column (column_name = \"attendance\") for rows with an index matching the value 18843 (row_index = 3)\n- To see if the opponent is panathinaikos, we need to look at the \"opponent\" column (column_name = \"opponent\") for rows with an index matching the value 3 (row_index = 3)\n- To check if the round is 'fr', we need to look at the \"round\" column (column_name = \"round\") for rows with an index matching the value 3 (row_index = 3)\n\nNow, let's output the answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify column names\",\n    \"Check if attendance matches claim\",\n    \"If attendance matches, check opponent\",\n    \"If opponent matches, check round\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\" }\n  ]\n}",
