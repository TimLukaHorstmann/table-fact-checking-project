If the given dance and song match any row's value in this column, it means I have found the correct row.\n5.

We will be looking for a row where the \"dance / song\" column provides additional information about the dance style (since \"goodman\" and \"horwood\" are judges, their scores can only be found in the same row as the dance/song).\n\n3. After checking each row, we find that the first row matches all of our criteria: Goodman gave an 8, Horwood gave a 7, the total score is 31, and the result is \"n / a\" which means it's not clear whether the pair was safe or eliminated (we can't determine this just from the table provided).\n\n4. However, since the claim specifically asks for a dance/song that has the result as \"safe\", we can't conclude that the first row definitely meets all criteria in the claim because its result is not clearly stated as \"safe\".\n\n5.
