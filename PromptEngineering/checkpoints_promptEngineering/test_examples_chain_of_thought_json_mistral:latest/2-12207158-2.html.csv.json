This can be done by iterating through the data column and finding the row where the value of the \"opponent\" column matches \"yankees\".\n   2. Once we find the row with the opponent as yankees, we will check the value in the \"record\" column to see if it is 4 - 5.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column in the table that represents the record (4 - 5). This column is named \"record\".\n2. Check each row in the table to find a match for the identified record value.\n3. The fourth row has the \"record\" value as \"4 - 5\", so it is a potential match.\n4. The column that represents the opponent is the third column, named \"opponent\".\n5. Inspect the opponent value in the fourth row. The value is not \"yankees\", so it is not a match for the claim.\n6. Since no other rows have the record value of \"4 - 5\", there are no more potential matches to inspect.\n7.
