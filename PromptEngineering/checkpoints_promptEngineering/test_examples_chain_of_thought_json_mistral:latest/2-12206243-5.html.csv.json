    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the team that played 6 games against another team (in this case, the Brewers). From the data provided, we can see that the White Sox and the Brewers have played 6 games. However, it seems there are some postponed games due to weather conditions, which might affect the total number of games played if these are considered as part of the count.\n2. Check if any of the postponed games were against the Brewers. The games postponed due to snow involve the White Sox and Angels (rows 11-23). No games postponed were specifically against the Brewers.\n3. Check for postponed games due to snow with the Brewers as opponents. In rows 4, 5, and 6, we find games that were not postponed. However, in row 7, there is a game postponed due to snow (as indicated by the \"10\" after the score). Therefore, this game does not count towards the total number of games played against the Brewers.\n4. In rows 8 and 9, more games were played against the Brewers, but these were not postponed.\n5. Going back to row 7 (the postponed game due to snow), we find that there are no further games against the Brewers following this one, so it's the only postponed game against the Brewers in this sequence of 6 games.\n6. Since there is only 1 game postponed due to snow out of the 6 games played between the White Sox and the Brewers, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team that played 6 games against another team\",\n    \"Check if any of the postponed games were against the Brewers\",\n    \"Check for postponed games due to snow with the Brewers as opponents\",\n    \"Investigate whether all the games against the Brewers were played\",\n    \"Determine if the number of postponed games matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n  ]\n}",

In this case, there isn't a specific column indicating if a game was a shutout or not.\n2. However, a shutout occurs when one team prevents the opposing team from scoring any runs during the entire game. Therefore, a loss with zero runs allowed by the pitcher might indicate a shutout.\n3. Look for rows where the \"loss\" column has an entry of a pitcher's name followed by \"(0 - 1)\", indicating that the pitcher lost the game but didn't allow any runs (which is equivalent to allowing zero runs).\n4. Examine these potential shutout games to ensure they are complete games, meaning no extra innings or additional scoring after the \"game over\" entry. This can be done by checking if there are subsequent entries for the same team on the same day without a break in the sequence of dates.\n\n   Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify if there is a column for shutouts\",\n    \"Determine if a loss with zero runs allowed might indicate a shutout\",\n    \"Search for such losses\",\n    \"Examine these potential shutout games to ensure they are complete games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n\nThe reasoning here is that there isn't a clear column indicating if a game was a shutout or not, and based on the provided data, there aren't any instances where a pitcher lost the game without allowing any runs, suggesting a shutout.
