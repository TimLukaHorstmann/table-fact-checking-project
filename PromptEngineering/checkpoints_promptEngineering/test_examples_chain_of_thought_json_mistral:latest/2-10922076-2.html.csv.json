Compare the values of the 'power plant' and 'producer' for each row in the table with the given claim (\"the chennai mohan power plant be produce by the mohan breweries & distilleries ltd company\").\n\n3. If we find a row where both the 'power plant' and 'producer' match either exactly or partially (ignoring case sensitivity) the claim, then we can confirm that the claim is TRUE.\n\n4.
