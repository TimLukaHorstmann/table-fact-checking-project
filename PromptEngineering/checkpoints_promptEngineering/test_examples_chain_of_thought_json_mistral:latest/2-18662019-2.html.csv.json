Extract the relevant data from the table for oleksandar vorobiov:\n   - Find the row index that contains \"oleksandar vorobiov ( ukr )\". In this case, the row index is 3.\n   - The total score for each gymnast in the given table is stored under the column named \"total\".\n\n3. Compare the extracted value with the claim:\n   - The value of \"total\" in the third row (which corresponds to oleksandar vorobiov) is 16.25. This matches the claimed total score.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim, extract the relevant data for the gymnast mentioned in the claim, and compare the extracted value with the claimed value.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the values for 'a score', 'b score' and 'total' for each gymnast in the table. This will help us understand the distribution of these values across all athletes.\n2. Check if there exists any row where the 'a score' is 6.800, the 'b score' is greater than the 'a score' of Chen Yibing (9.225) and the total is less than the total of Andrea Coppolino (15.975).\n3. For every row, compare the 'a score', 'b score', and 'total' values with the given conditions:\n    - If the 'a score' equals 6.800, check if the 'b score' is greater than 9.225 and the total is less than 15.975.\n    - If the current row's 'a score' is not equal to 6.800, move on to the next row as this condition doesn't apply.\n4. If a gymnast matches all these conditions, then return \"TRUE\" with relevant cells indicating the row number and column names where the matching values can be found.\n5. If no gymnast matches these conditions after checking every row, then return \"FALSE\".\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare each gymnast's 'a score', 'b score', and total with the given conditions.\",\n    \"Check if 'a score' equals 6.800, 'b score' > 9.225, and 'total' < 15.975 for each gymnast.\",\n    \"Iterate through all rows in the table\",\n    \"If a row matches the given conditions return 'TRUE' with relevant cells\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
