Determine if the difference between the counts is equal to 11.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant data:\n- We are looking for rows containing \"casino\" in the 'release info' column and 'heavenly' in the 'release info' column.\n\nTo count the number of songs released on each label, we need to loop through the table's 'data' array and find the corresponding rows. Here is the relevant data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of songs released on each label.\",\n    \"Loop through the table's 'data' array.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release info\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release info\" },\n    ...

Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the given claim as the number of songs released on Casino (4) is less than Heavenly (12), so even if we had calculated the correct difference, it still would have been false. It appears that there might be an error in the claim statement itself or our understanding of it.\n\nTo verify this assumption, I recommend double-checking the provided claim and table data for any potential errors or inconsistencies. If confirmed, the corrected claim should state that \"there are more song releases on Heavenly than on Casino\".",
