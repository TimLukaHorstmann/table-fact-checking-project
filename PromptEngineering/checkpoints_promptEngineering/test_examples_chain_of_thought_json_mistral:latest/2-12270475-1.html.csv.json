    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n1. Identify the table columns and data to understand what information is available. The table has six columns (state, preliminaries, interview, swimsuit, evening gown, average) and 10 rows of data for different states.\n2. Find the row that corresponds to North Carolina in the data. In this case, it's the 9th row with a \"state\" value of \"north carolina\".\n3. Examine the values in the 2nd and 5th columns (preliminaries and evening gown) for the selected row.\n4. Compare the identified values to the given claim: the preliminaries score is 8.068 and the evening gown score is 8.472.\n5. Determine if the values found in steps 3 and 4 match the ones specified in the claim.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table columns and data to understand what information is available\",\n    \"Find the row that corresponds to North Carolina in the data\",\n    \"Examine the values in the preliminaries and evening gown columns for the selected row\",\n    \"Compare the identified values with the ones specified in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
