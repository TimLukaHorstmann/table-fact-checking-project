Extract all relevant data from the table related to the New York Jets. This includes their game time, date, and opponent.\n\n3. Iterate through each row in the table's 'data' array until finding a match for the New York Jets.\n\n4. Compare the game time (column \"time (et)\") of the matching row with \"1:00 pm\".\n\n5. Compare the day of the week (implied by the date column) of the matching row with \"sunday\".\n\n6. Compare the date (column \"date\") of the matching row with \"november 27\" and extract the month and day from it to ensure it's a match.\n\nIf all comparisons are true, the claim is verified as TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"time (et)\" }\n- { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n- { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that during week 1, the game started at 9:00 pm.\n\n2. Locate the relevant row in the table: Since the claim specifies week 1, we need to find the row where the \"week\" column equals 1. In our given table, this corresponds to the first row.\n\n3. Extract the value of the time (ET) column for the relevant row: From the first row, we see that the value in the \"time (ET)\" column is \"9:00 pm\".\n\n4. Compare the extracted value with the claimed time: The extracted value matches the claimed time (\"9:00 pm\").\n\n5. Make a final determination: Since the claim and the extracted value match, we can conclude that the game indeed started at 9:00 pm during week 1.\n\nNow, let's output the result in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Locate the relevant row\",\n    \"Extract the value of the time (ET) column for the relevant row\",\n    \"Compare the extracted value with the claimed time\",\n    \"Make a final determination\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"time (ET)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we will iterate through the data array to find any row where the opponent column matches \"Seattle Seahawks\".\n2. Next, for each such row, we will check if the date (in this table represented by 'week' and converted to a proper date) matches 'sunday, november 27'.\n3.
