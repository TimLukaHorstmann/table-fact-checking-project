    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the stations owned by Bell Media from the data table. This can be done by finding all rows where the \"owner\" column equals \"Bell media\".\n\n2. Next, we need to count how many separate radio stations Bell Media owns. To do this, we will consider stations that have unique combinations of 'call sign' and 'format'. If a station has the same call sign as another one owned by Bell Media but a different format, it is considered separate.\n\n3. Now, for each station owned by Bell Media, we will check if there are any other stations with the same call sign but a different owner (CBC in this case).\n\n4. If we find that there are three unique radio stations with different formats and not owned by CBC, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"format\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": rows_with_cbc_indexes, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": rows_with_cbc_indexes, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}]\n\nIn this table, we can find three radio stations owned by Bell Media: 'ckko - fm' (Row 5), 'chsu - fm' (Row 6), and 'cilk - fm' (Row 7). We will need to find other rows where the 'call sign' matches one of these but the 'owner' is not \"Bell media\" or CBC.\n\nSince there are no such rows in this table, the claim is FALSE.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify radio stations owned by Bell Media\",\n    \"Count unique separate radio stations owned by Bell Media (considering call sign and format)\",\n    \"Check if these stations are not also owned by CBC\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {...any other rows where 'call sign' matches one of Bell Media stations and 'owner' is not \"Bell media\" or CBC}\n  ]\n}",
