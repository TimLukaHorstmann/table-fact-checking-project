Check the data column of the table for a row that has the same date as identified in step 1: In our table, the first row has the date \"may 17\", the second row has \"may 19\", the third row has \"may 22\", the fourth row has \"may 24\" and the fifth row has \"may 27\".\n\n3. Check if the home team in the identified row is \"chicago\": In our table, the row with the date \"may 24\" has the third column value as \"detroit\", which indicates that Detroit is the home team on that day.\n\n4. Since the home team for the game on May 24 is not Chicago, the given claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date of the game mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find the row in the data column that has the same date\",\n    \"Check if the home team in the found row is Chicago\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
