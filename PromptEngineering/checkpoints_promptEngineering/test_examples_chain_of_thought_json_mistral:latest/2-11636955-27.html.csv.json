The column names do not explicitly mention playoff games, but we can infer that \"reg gp\" stands for regular season games played, while \"pl gp\" might stand for playoff games played.\n\n2. Check each row to find players who have a non-zero value in the \"pl gp\" column, as this would indicate they have played in playoff games.\n\n3. If we find more than two players with a non-zero value in the \"pl gp\" column, then the claim is FALSE. If we find exactly two players with a non-zero value, then the claim might be TRUE and we should check their names against those provided in the claim.\n\n4. Compare the names of the two players found in step 3 to \"Peter Schaefer\" and \"Brent Sopel\". If both match exactly, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the data:\n\n1. Identify columns containing data about playoff games:\n```\n[\"rd\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"team (league)\", \"reg gp\", \"pl gp\"]\n```\n\n2. Check each row for players who have played in playoff games:\n- Peter Schaefer has a value of 63 under the \"pl gp\" column, indicating he has played in playoff games.\n- Brent Sopel has a value of 42 under the \"pl gp\" column, indicating he has also played in playoff games.\n\n3. Compare the names to those provided in the claim: Peter Schaefer and Brent Sopel were found to have played in playoff games, so the claim might be TRUE.\n\n4. Check that only two players have played in playoff games: In this case, we only found two players (Peter Schaefer and Brent Sopel) who have played in playoff games, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify columns containing data about playoff games\",\n    \"Check each row to find players who have played in playoff games\",\n    \"Compare the names of these players to those provided in the claim\",\n    \"Verify that only two players have played in playoff games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pl gp\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pl gp\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
