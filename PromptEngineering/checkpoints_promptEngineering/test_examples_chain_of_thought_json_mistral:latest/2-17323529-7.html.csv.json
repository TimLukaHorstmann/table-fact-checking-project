    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the table structure and the data provided. The table contains game statistics for a basketball team. It has a column called \"high assists\" which indicates the highest number of assists in each game by any player.\n\n2. Identify the relevant row based on the game index provided (40). In this case, the row with index 39 is not the correct one as it represents the game before game 40. The correct row is the one with index 40.\n\n3. Check the value in the \"high assists\" column for the selected row. In the row with index 40, the value in the \"high assists\" column is 6.\n\n4. Compare the identified value with the expected value from the claim (6). The identified value matches the expected value.\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude that the claim is true. Here's the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table structure and the data provided.\",\n    \"Identify the relevant row based on the game index (40).\",\n    \"Check the value in the 'high assists' column for the selected row.\",\n    \"Compare the identified value with the expected value from the claim (6).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 40,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
