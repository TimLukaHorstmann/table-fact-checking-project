The 'introduced' column contains the years of introduction for each class, and we will use it to compare and find the most recently introduced class.\n\n2. Parse the data in the 'introduced' column to understand its format. Some classes (e.g., \"dc\", \"dft\", \"dh\", \"dl\", \"dsc\", \"dsg\", \"dsj\", \"dx\", \"dxr\") have a specific year of introduction, while others (e.g., \"tr\", \"dbr\") have a range of years spanning multiple entries.\n\n3. Compare the years of introduction for each class to find the most recently introduced one. For those with a single year, this is straightforward. For classes with a range of years, we will consider the latest year within that range as their year of introduction.\n\n4. After comparing all classes, we will find the class \"tr\" has the longest span of years in its 'introduced' field (1936-1978).
