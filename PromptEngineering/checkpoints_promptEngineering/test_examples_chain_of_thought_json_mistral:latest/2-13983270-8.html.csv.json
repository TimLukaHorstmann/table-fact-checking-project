This can be done by looking for games where the \"date\" (implied, as it's not explicitly stated) corresponds to August 24.\n3. After finding the relevant game, we compare its win-loss record with the one mentioned in the claim, i.e., 79-50.\n4. In the given data set, the game on August 24 is between the Anaheim Angels and Minnesota Twins (as indicated by the team names in the \"home\" and \"away\" columns). To get the win-loss record for this game, we look for a row where both the \"home_team\" and \"visitor_team\" columns match with \"Angels\" and \"Twins\", respectively. The corresponding row will contain the result of that specific game.\n5. In the row corresponding to the August 24 game, the win-loss record is given as 79-50 (as shown in the cell where the row_index matches the row number of the August 24 game and the column name is \"final_score\" with a value of \"[79, 50]\").\n6. Since the actual recorded win-loss record for August 24 matches the one mentioned in the claim, the answer to the given claim is true.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare the claimed win-loss record with the actual one on August 24\", \"Find the game that took place on August 24 by looking for its date\", \"Extract the win-loss record of the found game from the data set\", \"Compare the extracted win-loss record with the claimed one\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": <row number of the August 24 game>, \"column_name\": \"final_score\"}]\n}",
