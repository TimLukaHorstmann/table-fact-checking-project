To verify if this statement is correct, we need to understand the difference between indicative and injunctive moods in Sanskrit.\n   - Indicative mood is used to state or ask questions about facts or situations.\n   - Injunctive mood is used to express suggestions, commands, or advice.

Since '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo' refers to a past action (used to do), it cannot be an injunctive verb.\n5.

Next, look for the verb \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\" (gares) in the same section of the table and find its translation as \"may you do\".\n5. Observe that the tenses are different between the two verbs; \"gari\" is a simple past tense, while \"gares\" is a potential form.\n6. Since the claim and the data provided have the same subject (\"you\"), but different tenses (simple past vs potential), there's no discrepancy or contradiction between them.\n7.

    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. Understand the claim: The claim states that the phrase '\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101' meaning 'i will (probably) do' in simple past can be equivalent to '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo' meaning 'you use to do' in the injunctive.\n2. Recall the provided data: The data contains a table of verb conjugations in Nepali.\n3. Analyze the table: Notice that the phrase '\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101' is present in the row for '1st person singular' and the column for 'present continuous'. Also, notice that '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo' is present in the row for '2nd person singular' and the column for 'irrealis past'.\n4. Compare: The simple past tense is not explicitly shown in the table but it can be inferred that it would be similar to other verbs in the same row, specifically in the 'present continuous' column which represents a future or ongoing action. However, '\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101' indicates a more uncertain future event, thus suggesting some level of probability. On the other hand, '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo' is used to express an action that was repeated in the past, indicating habitual or repeated action.\n5. Conclusion: Although not exactly equivalent, both phrases share a common characteristic of expressing uncertainty and probability in the case of '\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101', and expressing a repeated action in the past with '\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo'.

In the given data, the Simple Past tense for 'you' is represented by 'Garyo'. However, it is important to note that the presented data lacks the \"Optative Mood\" category for Simple Past.\n4.
