The \"written by\" column will help us identify episodes written by Scott Rosenbaum, while the \"us viewers (million)\" column will help us find episodes with 6.70 million viewers.\n3. Search for rows where the \"written by\" field equals Scott Rosenbaum: We need to find a row where the value in the \"written by\" column is equal to \"Scott Rosenbaum\".

Check if any of those rows also have a \"us viewers (million)\" value of 6.70: Once we have found all the episodes written by Scott Rosenbaum, we need to check if any of them also have a \"us viewers (million)\" value of 6.70.
