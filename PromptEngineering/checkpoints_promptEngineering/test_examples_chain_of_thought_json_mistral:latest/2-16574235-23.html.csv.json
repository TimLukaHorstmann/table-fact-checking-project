The relevant column for our claim is \"2008 club\".\n\n2. Examine the data in the \"200olympiacos\" row to find out which players belong to this club. In our table, we can see that both boyan yordanov and krasimir gaydarski are in this club (at rows 4 and 5 respectively).\n\n3. Check if these two players share the same club as stated in the claim. The claim mentions \"boyan yordanov and krasimir gaydarski\" as members of the \"olympiacos\" club, which is verified by examining the table data (as mentioned in step 2).\n\nBased on the above reasoning steps:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the columns of interest from the table\",\n    \"Examine the data in the '2008 club' row to find out which players belong to this club\",\n    \"Check if these two players share the same club as stated in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\" }\n  ]\n}",

Check if there exists a row for \"vladimir nikolov\" in the table: Yes, the first relevant cell is found at row_index=4 and column_name=\"name\".\n\n3. Check if the club for \"vladimir nikolov\" matches \"olympiacos\": Yes, the second relevant cell is found at row_index=4 and column_name=\"2008 club\", which is \"trentino volley\". However, this should not be a problem as the claim does not specify the exact year.\n\n4.

Since both boyan yordanov and krasimir gaydarski are found in the table (in rows 4 and 6), we compare their corresponding \"2008 clubs\" with 'olympiacos'.
