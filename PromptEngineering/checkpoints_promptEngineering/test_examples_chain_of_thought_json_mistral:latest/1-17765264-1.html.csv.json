    "resp": "Here are the steps in a clear and logical order to determine if the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the condition in the claim: The record (wins-losses) should be 4-4 when the attendance at the game is 14489.\n2. Locate the relevant rows in the table that contain the condition's variables (record and attendance). This will help us find the games where both conditions are met.\n3. Iterate through each row of the \"data\" array, comparing the values for the record and attendance columns.\n4. When we find a row where the record value is 4-4, note down that row's index as it will be the relevant cell for our final answer.\n5. If no such row is found, then the claim is false.\n6. Output the final answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the condition in the claim\", \"Locate relevant rows for the condition's variables\", \"Iterate through each row checking both conditions\", \"If found, note down the row index as relevant cell for final answer\", \"If not found, claim is false\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: Upon inspection of the table, we could not find a row with both record = \"4 - 4\" and attendance = 14489.
