Count the number of matches played at Gavle: Since Gavle is mentioned in the location column, we will count all the rows where the location column has \"Gavle\".\n4. Compare the result: If there are 4 or more rows (matches) with Gavle as the location and Tisha Venturini's name not appearing in any of them, then it can be concluded that Tisha Venturini did not play 4 matches at Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.\n5. Analyze the data: In this case, there are only three rows where the location column has \"Gavle\". Therefore, Tisha Venturini could have potentially played all these three matches if she played in every match at Gavle during the World Cup final. However, we do not have any information about Tisha Venturini's participation in this tournament.\n6.
