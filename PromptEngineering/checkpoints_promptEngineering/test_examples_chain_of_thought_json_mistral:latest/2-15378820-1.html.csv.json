Identify the information needed to verify the claim: We need to find the largest difference in scores (result) for any game, which implies finding the maximum value for the 'result' column and checking if there's another row with a smaller result but with a larger absolute difference.\n2. Extract the data from the table into a format that can be processed easily: I will sort the rows by the 'week' column to ensure chronological order, making it easier to find maximum and minimum values for each week.\n3. Iterate through each row and compare the current score with previous scores: Start from the second row (since we need to ignore the first game) and compare its score with the scores of all previous games. Update the maximum score difference if a larger one is found.\n4. Check the last row's score: After iterating through all rows, compare the final score with the initial score to see if they differ by more than 37 points (as per the claim).\n\n   Here's my output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify information needed: Find the largest difference in scores.\",\n    \"Extract data from table into a processable format.\",\n    \"Iterate through each row and compare current score with previous scores.\",\n    \"Check the last row's score.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: To verify the claim, I found the maximum score difference by iterating through each row and comparing scores, starting from the second row.
