Next, find the column that corresponds to \"attendance\" in the same row. In this case, it's the fourth column, with label \"attendance\".\n3. Extract the value of the \"attendance\" column for the \"vida\" team from the table data. This is the value 2709.\n4. Since there is only one instance of \"vida\" in the table, we can use this value as the total attendance for \"vida\".\n5. Calculate the average attendance for the home team \"vida\" by dividing the total attendance (2709) by the number of matches played by \"vida\" (1, since there is only one instance in the table). The result is 2709 / 1 = 2709.\n6. Compare this calculated average to the claim that the average attendance when the home team is \"vida\" is 2709.
