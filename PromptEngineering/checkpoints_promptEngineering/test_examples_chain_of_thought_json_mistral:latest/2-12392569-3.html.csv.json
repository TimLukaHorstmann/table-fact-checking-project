Identify the relevant nations from the table: Russia, United States, Ukraine, Japan, France, Italy, Hungary, China, Germany, Poland, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, and United Kingdom.\n2. Check if the claim refers to a specific time period like 1998-99. However, since there's no indication of the time period in the table or claim, we will assume that it refers to the data provided (i.e., total medals won regardless of the year).\n3. Calculate the total number of medals won by each country based on the 'gold', 'silver', and 'bronze' columns (assuming one gold medal is worth 3 points, one silver medal is worth 2 points, and one bronze medal is worth 1 point).\n4. Compare the total medal count for the United States and Japan in the table:\n    - United States: `4 (gold) + 8 (silver) + 9 (bronze) = 21`\n    - Japan: `3 (gold) + 2 (silver) + 3 (bronze) = 8`\n5. Determine the difference between the total medal count for the United States and Japan: `21 (US) - 8 (Japan) = 13`\n6.
