Next, we count the number of rows where the \"score\" column contains a value other than \"0 - 0\". This can be achieved by summing the occurrences of rows with different scores. In this table, there are 6 such rows (1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th rows).\n3. Since the total number of rows is 10, we subtract the number of rows with non-zero scores to find the number of rows where the home team scored zero: 10 - 6 = 4.\n4. Lastly, we compare this count with the number of times the home team scored zero out of all games. If the count is equal to 4, then it means that the home team scored zero three times out of all games (since one game ended as a replay and doesn't count towards the score for either team).\n\nWith this reasoning, we can now provide the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count total number of rows\",\n    \"Count number of rows where home team scores a non-zero value\",\n    \"Subtract the second count from the first to find the number of rows where home team scored zero\",\n    \"Compare the result with 3 (number of times the home team should have scored zero out of all games)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
