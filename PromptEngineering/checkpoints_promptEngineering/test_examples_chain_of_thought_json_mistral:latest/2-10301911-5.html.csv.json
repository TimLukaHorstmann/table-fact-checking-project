Look for the row in the table that matches 'b\u00f6rje jansson'. In our case, row_index = 8.\n3. Check the speed column of the matching row (row_index = 8) as it contains the information about the speed of 'b\u00f6rje jansson'.\n4. The value in the Speed column for row_index = 8 is \"90.57 mph\".\n\nBased on the above reasoning:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify columns, look for 'b\u00f6rje jansson', find speed in his row (column 4)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the columns in the table to look for the required information. The columns are \"place\", \"rider\", \"country\", \"machine\", \"speed\", \"time\", and \"points\".\n\n2. Find the row where the rider's name is \"b\u00f6rje jansson\". In this case, we can find that \"b\u00f6rje jansson\" is in the third row, with a column index of 1 (rider).\n\n3. Check the speed for the same row to verify if it matches the claimed speed (\"90.57 mph\"). In this case, the speed for the third row is \"90.57 mph\", which matches the claimed speed.\n\n4. Finally, confirm that the rider's country is \"sweden\" as well, to ensure that there are no errors or inconsistencies in the data. In this case, the country for the third row is \"sweden\", which is consistent with the fact that \"b\u00f6rje jansson\" is from Sweden.\n\nSince all the checks above are met, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the columns in the table\", \"Find the row where the rider's name is 'b\u00f6rje jansson'\", \"Check the speed for the same row to verify if it matches the claimed speed\", \"Confirm that the rider's country is 'sweden'\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"speed\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
