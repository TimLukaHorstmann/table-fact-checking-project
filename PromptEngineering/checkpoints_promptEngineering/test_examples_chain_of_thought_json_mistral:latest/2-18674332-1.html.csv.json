    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, we need to find out when the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers took place. From the table, we can see that it occurred on December 10, 1978 (row 15).\n2. Next, we need to find out when the game against the Detroit Lions took place. From the table, we can see that it occurred on December 17, 1978 (row 16).\n3. To determine whether the game against the Detroit Lions took place one week after the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, we need to compare their dates. One week is approximately 7 days, and a day in this table is represented as a date. Therefore, if we subtract December 10, 1978 (game against Tampa Bay) from December 17, 1978 (game against Detroit), the result should be around 7 days.\n4. To compare the dates, we can subtract the number of days between them using a date difference function. Since this is not provided in the table, we cannot perform this operation directly but can make an observation based on the given data.\n5. Observing the table, we notice that one week has passed between the game against Tampa Bay and the game against the New Orleans Saints (row 14), which took place on December 3, 1978 (one week after the game against Tampa Bay). The game against Detroit took place two days later than the game against New Orleans.\n6. Since one week has passed between the game against Tampa Bay and the game against the New Orleans Saints, and another day has passed before the game against Detroit, we can say that the game against Detroit took place approximately one week after the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find when the game against Tampa Bay and Detroit took place\",\n    \"Compare the dates to determine if Detroit's game was a week after Tampa Bay's\",\n    \"Since we cannot use date difference function, observe if one week has passed between relevant games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",
