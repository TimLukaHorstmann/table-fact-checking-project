Since no teams meet the condition of having 51 points, it is unnecessary to check their number of losses (as they do not meet the first condition).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim conditions: No team has 51 points and more than 5 losses.\", \"Check the 'points' column for teams with 51 points or more: None of the teams have this many points.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n1. First, I will look through the table to find all the rows where the \"points 1\" column value is 49 (since this is the key number mentioned in the claim).\n2. Next, for each of those rows, I will check if the \"lost\" column value is greater than 3 as per the claim's condition.\n3. If there are no such rows found or any row where both conditions are true, then the claim would be valid (i.e., it would be TRUE). Otherwise, the claim would be false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find all rows where 'points 1' is equal to 49\",\n    \"For each of those rows, check if 'lost' column value is greater than 3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n\nExplanation: Upon inspecting the table, it can be seen that there are no teams with a 'points 1' value of 49 and a 'lost' count greater than 3. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. However, since there are no relevant cells for this case (as none fulfill the specified conditions), I have left the \"relevant_cells\" field empty in the final JSON object.",
