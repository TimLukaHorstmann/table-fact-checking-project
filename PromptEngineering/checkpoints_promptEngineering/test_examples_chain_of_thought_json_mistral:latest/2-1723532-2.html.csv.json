The 'score' column is not directly related to the claim, but knowing it may help confirm if a match actually took place.\n\n3. Iterate through each row in the table: Compare the 'opponent', 'tournament' (if necessary), and 'surface' values of each row with \"j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier\", \"nice\" and \"clay\".\n\n4. Check for matching rows: If a row is found where the 'opponent' value matches \"j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier\", the 'tournament' value matches \"nice\", and the 'surface' value matches \"clay\", then that row represents the match in question.\n\n5.
