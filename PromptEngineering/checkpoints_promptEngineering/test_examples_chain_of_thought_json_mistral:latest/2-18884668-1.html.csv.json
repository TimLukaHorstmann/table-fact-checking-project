By finding the row where the \"elector\" is from Pisa, we can identify the relevant person.\n3. Search for the row related to the Pisan elector: In this table, there are 10 rows with data about different individuals. To find the Pisan elector, we will look for a row where the \"elector\" column matches \"Pisa\" or any variant of it in the \"place_of_origin\" column.\n4. Verify if the elevation event happened in 1117: Once we have identified the row related to the Pisan elector, we will look at the \"elevated\" column for that row. If the value matches or is close to 1117, it would support the claim.\n5.

Iterate through the data array of the table and find the row that matches the given name. We can do this by comparing each row's \"elector\" column with our target name (in this case, 'bosone'). If a match is found, we have identified the relevant row.\n3. Check if the cardinalatial order and title for the matched row are the same as specified in the claim - In this case, we need to check whether \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\" matches with the value at the fourth column of the identified row.\n4. Determine the year of elevation from the table - We can find this information in the third column of the identified row. If the year found is around 1116, it matches with what is specified in the claim. However, since we don't have exact years in the table, we need to consider a range of a few years before and after 1116.\n5. Combine the results of steps 3 and 4 to arrive at an answer - If both cardinalatial order and title match and the year of elevation is within a reasonable range around 1116, then the claim is considered TRUE.

In this case, we need to find the elector from Pisa and determine their elevation date as well as the pope who elevated them.\n2.

In this table, there is only one row with a nationality of \"pisa\" - the sixth row, which contains the name \"crisogono malcondini\".\n3. Examine the fifth column (elevation date) in the row found above to determine if it matches the elevation year given in the claim (1117). In this case, the elevation date for crisogono malcondini is 1117, which matches the elevation year given in the claim.\n4. Check if the pope who elevated crisogono malcondini is urban ii or paschal ii as per the claim. In this table, the fourth column (elevated) gives us the name of the pope who elevated each cardinal.
