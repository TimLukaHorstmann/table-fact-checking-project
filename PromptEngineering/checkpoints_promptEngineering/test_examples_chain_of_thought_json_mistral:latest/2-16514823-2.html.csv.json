Check if there exists a row in the table where the value of the \"opponents\" column matches \"g\u00f6teborg\".\n3. For each such row, verify that the value of the \"date\" (implied by the year and month) is \"2015 - 09 - 19\".\n4. If a matching row is found, identify it in the table by noting its row_index and the column name (\"opponents\") as relevant cells.\n5. Output the final answer based on the presence/absence of such a matching row.\n\nThe final output will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team and date in claim\", \"Check if 'opponents' matches 'g\u00f6teborg'\", \"For each match, verify the date is '2015 - 09 - 19'\", \"If a match is found, identify it and its relevant cell\", \"Output final answer based on match\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThe reason for the final output being FALSE is that there is no row in the table where both the \"opponents\" column and the implied date (year and month) match those specified in the claim.",
