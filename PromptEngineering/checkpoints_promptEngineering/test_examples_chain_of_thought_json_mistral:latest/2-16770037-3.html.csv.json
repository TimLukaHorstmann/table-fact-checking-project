Inspect the table to find rows where 'try diff' is equal to \"+ 15\". The first row matches this condition: castres olympique has a try diff of \"+ 15\" (row_index=0).\n3. Check the value for 'tries against' in the matching row. In our case, tries against for castres olympique is 6 (column_name=\"tries against\", row_index=0).\n4. Compare the value found in step 3 with the expected value stated in the claim, which is 14. The value from step 3 (6) does not match the expected value (14), so the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's construct the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim: when try diff be +15 the tries against be 14\", \"Inspect table to find rows where 'try diff' is equal to +15\", \"Check value for 'tries against' in the matching row\", \"Compare the found value with the expected value stated in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"tries against\"},{\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"try diff\"}]\n}\n```",
