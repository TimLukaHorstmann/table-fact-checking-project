    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the claim:\n\n1. Identify models which have 90% after 1 year from the table.\n2. For each of those models, find their capacity percentage after 3 years.\n3. Check if all the selected models have 80% or more as their capacity percentage after 3 years.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant models with 90% after 1 year:\n- From the table, we can see that \"hr - 3uwxb\", \"bk - 4hcc\" and \"sanyo hr - 4u\" have 90% after 1 year.\n\nNext, let's check their capacities after 3 years for these models:\n- For \"hr - 3uwxb\", it has \"n / a\" for the capacity percentage after 3 years. This model does not meet the condition.\n- For \"bk - 4hcc\", it has \"80%\" as its capacity percentage after 3 years. This model meets the condition.\n- For \"sanyo hr - 4u\", it also has \"n / a\" for the capacity percentage after 3 years. This model does not meet the condition.\n\nNow we have found one model that meets the condition (bk - 4hcc), so the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find models with 90% after 1 year\",\n    \"Check capacity percentage after 3 years for those models\",\n    \"If all selected models have 80% or more as their capacity percentage after 3 years, the claim is TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 47,\n      \"column_name\": \"After 1 year (%)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 48,\n      \"column_name\": \"After 3 years (%)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
