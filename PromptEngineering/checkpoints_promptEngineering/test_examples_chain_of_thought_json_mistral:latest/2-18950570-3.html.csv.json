Find the row corresponding to 'yellow': In the table, the row names (columns) are racial groups, and we are looking for 'yellow'. The relevant row index in the data array is 2.\n\n3. Find the column corresponding to \"0, 35723\": In this specific row, the values of each group are represented as a string of percentages and an actual number (population). We need to find the column where the value is \"0, 35723\". This is not present in the given data.\n\n4. Analyze the claim: The claim states that \"0, 35723\" should be a value for 'yellow'. However, according to the table, there is no such value for 'yellow'. Therefore, it's incorrect.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to 'yellow'\",\n    \"Find the column corresponding to '0, 35723'\",\n    \"Analyze the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, check if there are any rows in the table where Brazil's population percentage is 0, which would correspond to the \"brazil\" column containing a value of \"0, 43%\". No such row was found.\n2. However, the table does contain a row where the total population percentage (sum of all non-Brazil ethnicities) is close to 100%, and Brazil's population percentage is 0%. This row is the second one, as it has \"100%\" in the \"brazil\" column.\n3. Since there's no direct correspondence between the total population percentage and the fertility rate for any ethnicity, we cannot find the yellow fertility rate using this information alone. Instead, we need to find the relationship between these variables across different rows.\n4. In this table, each row corresponds to a different region, and the data provided seems to represent the population and the fertility rate of that region's ethnicities. The yellow population for each region is found in the fourth column of the corresponding row.\n5. Since we cannot find the yellow fertility rate in the table as requested, there seems to be a mismatch between the claim and the available data.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if 'brazil' column contains a value of '0, 43%'.\",\n    \"Find a row where Brazil's population percentage is 0%.\",\n    \"Try to find the yellow fertility rate using only this row.\",\n    \"Find the relationship between ethnicities and their corresponding fertility rates across rows.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"brazil\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"yellow\" }\n  ]\n}",
