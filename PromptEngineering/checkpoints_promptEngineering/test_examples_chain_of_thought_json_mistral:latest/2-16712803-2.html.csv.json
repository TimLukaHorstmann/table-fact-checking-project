Identify the opponent who played against the team (in this case, it seems to be a team from St. Louis, but there isn't an exact match for \"St. Louis Cardinals\" in the table). However, \"st louis cardinals\" is listed as an opponent in row 14.\n2. Compare the attendance of every game where the opponent was \"st louis cardinals\". To do this, we will go through each row and compare the \"attendance\" column value to those of other rows with \"st louis cardinals\" as the opponent.\n3. Inspect the attendance values for all rows with \"st louis cardinals\" as the opponent: 29527 (row 14)\n4. Determine if this is the minimum attendance among all games. Since we found a lower attendance (29527) for the game against \"st louis cardinals\", we can now compare it with the remaining rows to ensure there are no other lower attendances.\n5. Iterate through the remaining rows of the table and compare their attendance values to 29527. We don't find any row where the opponent is not \"st louis cardinals\" and the attendance is less than 29527.\n6.
