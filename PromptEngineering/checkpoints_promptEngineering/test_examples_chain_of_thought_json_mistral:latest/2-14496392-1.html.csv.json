The data section contains rows with three pieces of information: state, time period, and corresponding value.\n\n3. Find the relevant rows: In this case, we are looking for rows that contain Bihar and Gujarat states. We should also focus on the columns that correspond to the 1990 - 95 time period.\n\n4.
