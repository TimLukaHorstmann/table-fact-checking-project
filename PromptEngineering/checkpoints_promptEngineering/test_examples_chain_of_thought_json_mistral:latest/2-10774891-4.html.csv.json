Compare the given date with the dates provided in the table: The table contains matches from 11 May 1957, not 1967. Therefore, it appears that the claim does not match any data in the provided table.\n\n3. Check if there are any other columns that could potentially help verify the claim: There is no column named \"opponent\" or anything similar that might identify the opponent team for Essendon. The only information about opponents can be inferred from the \"away team\" column, but it seems to match neither the name of the team nor the score provided in the claim.\n\n4. Summarize the results: Since the given date does not match any of the dates in the table and there is no way to identify the opponent based on the available information, we cannot confirm that Essendon's opponent score was 13.11 (89) on 11 May 1967 at Princes Park.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Compare given date with table dates\",\n    \"Check for other potential columns to verify the claim\",\n    \"Summarize results\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
