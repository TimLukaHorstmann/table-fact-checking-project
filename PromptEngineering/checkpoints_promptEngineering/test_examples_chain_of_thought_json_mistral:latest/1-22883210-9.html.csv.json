Check if there's a row in the data that matches the team 'Golden State'.\n\n3. If there is such a row, check if the location attendance for that game is 'AT&T center 18581'.\n\n4. If both conditions are met, the claim is TRUE. If not, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n\n- Check the row_index where the team is Golden State (in this case, it's row 19).\n- The column_name for the location attendance is 'location_attendance' (which doesn't exist in this dataset; it seems there might be a mistake in the claim as the correct column name is 'attendance').\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team in the claim (Golden State)\",\n    \"Find the row where the team matches Golden State\",\n    \"Check if the location attendance for that game is 'AT&T center 18581'\",\n    \"If both conditions are met, the claim is TRUE.

The columns of interest are \"game\", \"team\".\n2. Iterate through each row of the data, comparing the \"team\" value with the team we're looking for (Cleveland).\n3. If a row has the \"team\" equal to \"cleveland\", then that is the row containing the game number for Cleveland.\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which rows of the table correspond to the games against Golden State Warriors (GS) and Oklahoma City Thunder (OKC).\n2. We can see that there are two rows with \"game\" values 69 (GS game) and 72 (OKC game).\n3. Next, we need to check the \"location attendance\" column for these rows to see if they both were played at the AT&T Center.\n4. In row 69 (GS game), the \"location attendance\" value is \"at&t center 18581\".\n5. In row 72 (OKC game), the \"location attendance\" value is also \"at&t center 18581\".\n6. Since both games were played at the same location, we need to check if the attendance for both games was over 19000.\n7. In row 69 (GS game), the attendance is not given, so we cannot compare it with OKC's attendance.\n8. In row 72 (OKC game), the attendance value is \"at&t center 18581\", but there's no explicit attendance count in this data. However, since all games are listed with their respective arenas and no other game has an attendance of over 19000 at the AT&T Center, we can infer that the OKC game had over 19000 in attendance.\n\nSince we cannot definitively determine if the GS game had over 19000 in attendance due to a lack of explicit data, we cannot claim with certainty that both games fulfilled the given condition. However, we can say that the OKC game did meet the requirement for having over 19000 in attendance at the AT&T Center.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the rows corresponding to GS and OKC games\",\n    \"Check the 'location attendance' column for both games\",\n    \"Compare the attendance for both games against the threshold of over 19000\",\n    \"Infer that the OKC game had over 19000 in attendance due to a lack of explicit data and no other AT&T Center game having more than 19000 attendees\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"location_attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"location_attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
