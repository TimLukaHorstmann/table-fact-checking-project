Check the years at school column for Tom O'Brien coaching at NC State - In this row, it is stated that he coached for 4 years. However, we are asked to verify if he coached for 3 years. Since the claim states 3 years, and he actually coached for 4 years, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n4. Check the record at school column for Tom O'Brien coaching at NC State - In this row, it is stated that his record was 91-66. This does not match the record at school claimed in the statement (16 - 21). So, this part of the claim is also FALSE.\n5.

Identify the claim's key elements: The claim states that Randy Shannon of the Maryland team has an ACC record of 12-4 and spent 1 year at school.\n2. Locate the relevant data for Randy Shannon in the table: In this case, the row index is 8 because Randy Shannon is associated with the 8th row.\n3. Check if the overall record, ACC record, and years at school for Randy Shannon match the claim: The overall record for Randy Shannon is 21-17 (row 8). This does not match the claimed overall record of 9-5. However, the ACC record for Randy Shannon is 11-13 (row 8), which is close but doesn't exactly match the claimed ACC record of 12-4. The years at school for Randy Shannon are 4 (row 8). This does not match the claim that he spent 1 year at school.\n4. Since there is no exact match between the data in the table and the given claim, it is necessary to determine whether there might be a mistake or inconsistency in the provided data or the claim itself.
