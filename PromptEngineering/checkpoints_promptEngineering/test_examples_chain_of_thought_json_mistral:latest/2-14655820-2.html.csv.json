We will store these rows for future reference.\n2. Then, for each game where the Packers lost, we will check if the opponent is either the Minnesota Vikings or the Buffalo Bills (looking at the 'opponent' column).\n3. If there are any games that match both conditions (i.e., the Packers lost and the opponent is either the Minnesota Vikings or the Buffalo Bills), we will extract the attendance for those games to check if they are instances where the Packers lost by 15 points or more.\n4. To determine whether a loss was by 15 points or more, we can parse the 'result' column (which is in format \"score_packers - score_opponent\"). We will split this string using space as delimiter and convert both scores to integers, then calculate the difference between them. If the difference is greater than or equal to 15, it means the Packers lost by 15 points or more.\n\nNow, let's find relevant rows:\n- First, we need to identify all games where the Packers lost: [0, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14]\n- Then, for these rows, we will check if the opponent is either the Minnesota Vikings or Buffalo Bills. Row 0 matches since opponent is the Minnesota Vikings. Row 4 also matches because opponent is the Buffalo Bills.\n- Finally, we will check if these games (rows 0 and 4) are instances where the Packers lost by 15 points or more:\n  - For row 0, result = \"l 32 - 17\". Parsing this string gives us scores 32 for the Vikings and 17 for the Packers. The difference between these scores is 15, so this game qualifies as a loss by 15 points or more.\n  - For row 4, result = \"l 27 - 7\". Parsing this string gives us scores 27 for the Buffalo Bills and 7 for the Packers. The difference between these scores is 20, which is greater than 15, so this game also qualifies as a loss by 15 points or more.\n\nHere's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all games where the Packers lost\",\n    \"For each game where the Packers lost, check if opponent is either Minnesota Vikings or Buffalo Bills\",\n    \"If there are any games that match both conditions, extract attendance for those games and check if they are instances where the Packers lost by 15 points or more\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
