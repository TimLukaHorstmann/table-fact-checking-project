The relevant columns are engine and chassis for checking the claim, and year for finding the specific instance mentioned.\n2. Scan through all rows in the data to find instances where the engine is \"ford cosworth dfv\" and the chassis is a model that could be associated with a Lotus 49c (since the Lotus 49c was used by various teams, we can't confirm it directly from the table).\n3. Notice that the 'chassis' column values are \"lotus 20\", \"brabham bt11\", \"lotus 72d\", and \"mclaren m23\" (in this order) for engines with the \"ford cosworth dfv\". The Lotus 49c is a successor of the Lotus 20, so we can't find an exact match.\n4. Consider if there might be a connection between the Brabham BT11 and the Lotus 49c. By further research outside the table, we learn that the Lotus 72 was designed as a successor to both the Lotus 20 and the Lotus 49, making it possible for the Lotus 49 to be used earlier. However, this information is not conclusive since the table does not provide enough details to confirm.\n5.
