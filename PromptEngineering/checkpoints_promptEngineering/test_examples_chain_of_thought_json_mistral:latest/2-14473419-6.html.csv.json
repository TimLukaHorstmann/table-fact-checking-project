    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team for which we are looking at the record: Boston Bruins (from the opponent column)\n2. Determine the row index corresponding to the 48th game for the Boston Bruins in the data array (we start counting from 0, so 47 + 1 = 48)\n3. Check the score column of the identified row for the win-loss-tie record: The value is \"0 - 0 ot\", indicating a tie.\n4. Check the other columns in the row to confirm that it belongs to the Boston Bruins and is indeed the 48th game: The values for the game, opponent, and previous rows' game indices match (48, Boston Bruins, 47).\n5. Extract the win-loss-tie record from the score column by separating the numbers with hyphens, then convert each part to an integer (0, 0, 10)\n6. Compare the obtained win-loss-tie record with the claimed one: The total number of wins and losses should be equal for a match, and the number of ties and losses should be less than or equal to one. In this case, there's no win, loss, or tie difference since both have 0 wins, 0 losses, and 10 ties.\n7.

In our table, there is only one instance of a record that matches '27 - 11 - 9', which is associated with row_index=3.\n\n3. Check the date (or month) for this game. Unfortunately, the table does not provide any information about the dates or months for the games.
