Count the number of fighters by finding the number of unique opponents from the data array. There are 9 unique opponents (johnathan ivey, wes sims, dan severn, maurice smith, patrick smith, kazushi sakuraba, carl franks, victor tatarkin, and gary myers). However, since Kazushi Sakuraba appears twice (once with a \"loss\" and once with a \"nc\"), there are only 8 unique fighters.\n3. Check if any fighter has a record of 5-3. To do this, iterate through each row where the \"record\" column is non-empty (since a record of 5-3 would mean that there were 5 wins and 3 losses).\n4. For each such row, parse the data in the \"record\" column to get the number of wins and losses. If the number of wins is 5 and the number of losses is 3, then we have found our fighter with a 5-3 record.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count total rows to find number of fighters\",\n    \"Find unique opponents to get total number of fighters\",\n    \"Check if any fighter has a record of 5-3 by iterating through each row where 'record' is non-empty\",\n    \"For each such row, parse the data in the 'record' column to get the number of wins and losses\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
