The table provides an \"attendance\" value for each game, which can be found in the \"Attendance\" column.\n2.

In this case, the attendance values are: 40554 (row 138), 20202 (row 190), 28757 (row 199), 28173 (row 206), 36796 (row 223), 39070 (row 228), 44145 (row 247), 45177 (row 252), 44945 (row 257).\n3.

We can determine this by finding the row where the date matches \"september 7\". However, the table does not provide a column for the date. Since the rows are sorted by date (ascending), we can simply start from the beginning and check each row until we find a match or reach the game on September 8th (row 191).\n5. Once we have found the row_index for the game on September 7th, we compare its attendance value to the minimum value found in step 3. In this case, the game on September 7th has a row index of 136 and an attendance value of 40554.
