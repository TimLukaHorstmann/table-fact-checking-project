Locate the row that matches the given municipality \"mexicali\" in the data table. In this case, the relevant row is the second one with an index of 1.\n\n3. Check if the population of the located row matches the expected area value (13700.0 km2 for Mexicali). However, since the claim does not ask about the population but about the inegi code, this step is irrelevant to the final answer.\n\n4. Extract the inegi code from the located row (2 in the \"inegi code\" column).\n\n5. Compare the extracted inegi code with the expected inegi code value (2.0).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim's main components\",\n    \"Locate row for given municipality ('mexicali')\",\n    \"Check if population matches expected area\",\n    \"Extract inegi code from located row\",\n    \"Compare extracted inegi code with expected value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"inegi code\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"area (km2)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
