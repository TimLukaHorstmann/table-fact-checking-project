    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim's components, which are the agent (\"cyanogen bromide\") and two specific properties (field stability and effectiveness as a blood agent).\n2. Check if the table contains a row with the agent name matching \"cyanogen bromide\". In this case, it does. The row index is 4.\n3. Identify the columns in the table that correspond to the claimed properties. For field stability, it is the fifth column named \"field stability\", and for effectiveness as a blood agent, it is the fourth column named \"effectiveness as blood agent\".\n4. Verify the values in the identified cells (row_index, column_name) in the row of interest (row_index = 4). For field stability, the value is 5. For effectiveness as a blood agent, the value is 9.\n5. Compare the obtained values with the claim's components. The values match the claim's components.\n6.
