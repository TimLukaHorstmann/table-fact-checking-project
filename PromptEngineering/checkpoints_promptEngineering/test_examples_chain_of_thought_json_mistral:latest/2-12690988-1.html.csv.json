    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that the goal for friendly competition should be less than 3.\n2. Identify the relevant column: To verify the claim, we need to look at the goals scored when the competition was a friendly match. According to the table, the \"goal\" and \"competition\" columns are relevant.\n3. Filter the data based on the condition: From the data provided, only rows where the competition is 'friendly' should be considered for verification of the claim. The filtered data would be:\n    - [ [1,\"24 march 2007\",\"3 - 1\",\"3 - 1\",\"friendly\"] ] (row_index=0)\n    - [ [2,\"3 march 2010\",\"1 - 2\",\"1 - 2\",\"friendly\"] ] (row_index=1)\n    - [ [4,\"22 may 2013\",\"1 - 1\",\"2 - 1\",\"friendly\"] ] (row_index=3)\n4. Check the goals for friendly matches: In the filtered data, there are three rows with goals scored in a friendly competition. For each row, we need to check whether the goal is less than 3.\n    - Goal in row_index=0 is \"3\" which does not meet the condition (goal > 3)\n    - Goal in row_index=1 is \"1\" which meets the condition (goal < 3)\n    - Goal in row_index=3 is \"1\" which meets the condition (goal < 3)\n5. Combine the results: Since only one out of three rows meets the goal condition (less than 3), the overall claim can be considered partially true. However, since our task was to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we will output a final answer as FALSE because it is not entirely true that all friendly matches have goals less than 3.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify the relevant column\",\n    \"Filter the data based on the condition\",\n    \"Check the goals for friendly matches\",\n    \"Combine the results\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\" }\n  ]\n}",
