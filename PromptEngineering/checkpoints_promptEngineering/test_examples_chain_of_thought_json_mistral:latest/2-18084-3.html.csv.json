For each athlete with a long jump equal to the maximum, check their nationality (fourth column) to see if they are from the United States.\n4.

Understand the data structure: The table provides data about various athletes, their jump marks (mark), wind conditions (wind), names (athlete), nationalities (nationality), venues (venue), and dates (date).\n\n3. Define what is considered a 'long jump mark': We need to establish a standard for comparing the lengths of the jumps since the data given in the table is not consistent (some have feet, some have meters with different levels of precision).
