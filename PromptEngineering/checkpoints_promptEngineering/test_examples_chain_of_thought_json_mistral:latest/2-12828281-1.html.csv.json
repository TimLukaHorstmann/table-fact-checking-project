Compare the date in the current row with the given claim date.\n4. If a match is found, note that the game was played during week `row_index + 1` (since weeks start from 1 and not 0).\n5. Since there seems to be a match for \"december 6 , 1964\" in the 13th row, we can conclude that the game was played during week 13.\n\nWith this reasoning, here is the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim date (december 6, 1964)\", \"Loop through each row in data array\", \"Compare the date with the given claim date\", \"If a match is found, determine that the game was played during week row_index + 1\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Check if the table contains a column named 'date'. The presence of this column indicates that the data includes dates for each game.\n2. If the date column exists, then check if the table also contains games from 1964 (the year mentioned in the claim). Since the earliest date in the table is September 13, 1964 and the latest date is December 20, 1964, it is reasonable to assume that all the data comes from 1964.\n3. If the game was played in 1964, then there should be a correlation between the 'date' column and the number of weeks that have passed since the start of the season. We can determine this by finding out if there is a pattern in the 'week' column where each value incrementally increases.\n4. If steps 1-3 are true, then we should be able to find the game played on December 2, 1964 and check its corresponding 'week' number. If that week number exists, then it is possible that the claim might be true. However, since there isn't any data for December 2, 1964 in the table, we cannot definitively say if the claim is true or false based on this information alone.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check presence of 'date' column\",\n    \"Verify that data comes from 1964\",\n    \"Investigate correlation between 'date' and 'week'\",\n    \"Find game played on December 2, 1964\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
