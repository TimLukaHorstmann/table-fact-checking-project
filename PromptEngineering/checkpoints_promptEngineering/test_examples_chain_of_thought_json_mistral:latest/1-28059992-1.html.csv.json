Find all the rows (pairs) in the data section where the \"cfl team\" column matches with Calgary Stampeders. This will give us rows [5] and [7].\n3. For each of these rows, find the value in the 'pick' column. This gives us picks 5 for row [5] and 7 for row [7].\n4. Compare these picks to see which is smaller. The smaller pick number indicates the earlier draft position, hence the first pick by Calgary. Therefore, we need to compare pick 5 (from row [5]) and pick 7 (from row [7]). Pick 5 is smaller, so it corresponds to an earlier draft position.\n5. Now, find the player associated with each of these picks: Doug Brown (row [5]) and Jason Clemett (row [7]).\n6. Compare the players to see if Jason Clemett comes before Mark Farraway in the table. To do this, we will scan the table row by row starting from the first row, until we find Mark Farraway's row (row [8]).\n7. As we scan through the rows, we observe that:\n   - Row [6] has a player named Steve Charbonneau who comes before Jason Clemett according to their respective picks and positions in the table. However, since the claim refers only to draft pick by Calgary, it does not matter if there are other players between Doug Brown (pick 5) and Jason Clemett (pick 7).\n   - Row [8] has a player named Mark Farraway, which is the player we're interested in.
