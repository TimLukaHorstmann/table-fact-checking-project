Find all rows related to Pohang Steelers: In the table, we can find one row where \"home team\" equals \"Pohang Steelers\". This row is at index 0 in the 'data' array.\n3. Determine the round for Pohang Steelers in each match: The round number can be found in the first column of the relevant row. In this case, it's 1 (row_index=0).\n4. Find all matches where Pohang Steelers are the home team in subsequent rounds: Starting from the second row (row_index=1), we look for rows where \"home team\" equals \"Pohang Steelers\". If any such row is found, then it means that there is a later round for Pohang Steelers as the home team.\n5. Check if there are any subsequent matches where Pohang Steelers are the home team: We can see that no such rows exist in the table (the remaining rows all have \"home team\" equal to Adelaide United or Beng d'o d'a ng).\n6.
