Compare the calculated difference with the claim: The difference in scores is exactly 5 points, which is lower than what was claimed (5.4 points). However, since our table only contains whole numbers for scores, we cannot conclude that the claim is strictly true due to potential rounding errors.\n6. To be precise and account for any possible rounding differences, we would need more information about the scoring system used during this game (e.g., fractions of points allowed).
