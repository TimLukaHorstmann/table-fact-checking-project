This opponent has 3 records in the table with row indices [1], [6] and [8].\n2. Next, check the 'round' column for each of these three records to see if any of them have a round value of 3.\n   - Row index 1: The value is 'win', '8 - 2', 'dan christison', 'decision (unanimous)', 'ifl : chicago', '3'. Since the round value is 3, we mark this as a potential match.\n   - Row index 6: The value is 'loss', '4 - 2', 'travis wiuff', 'decision (unanimous)', 'euphoria : usa vs world', '3'. Since the round value is not 3, we discard this record.\n   - Row index 8: The value is 'win', '3 - 0', 'kristof midoux', 'tko (doctor stoppage)', 'hooknshoot : absolute fighting championships 2', '1'. Since the round value is not 3, we discard this record.\n3. At this point, only one potential match remains: Row index 1 with Dan Christison. Since we found a match where Dan Christson fought in a 3-round bout, we need to verify if there are any other opponents who also had 3 rounds.\n4. Repeat the process for all the opponents in the table but starting from row index 2 (as we already have a potential match for Dan Christison). We don't find any additional matches.\n5.
