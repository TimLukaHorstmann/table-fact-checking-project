Understand the claim: This means we should look for an episode where \"everybody finds out\" and the episode number should be 111.0 (note the decimal point).\n\n3. Check the table structure: The table has a 'data' array containing multiple sub-arrays, each representing a row of data with column names like \"no in series\", \"no in season\", etc.\n\n4. Iterate through the rows: Go through every episode in the 'data' array.\n\n5. Check the relevant columns: For each episode, check the \"title\" to see if it describes an episode where \"everybody finds out\". Also, check the \"no in series\" column to verify that the episode number matches 111 (ignoring the decimal point since it is not present in the table).\n\n6.

We then compare the episode number (11) with the \"no in series\" column to find the corresponding row in the table. The row index for this episode is 8 since it's the 9th row but we start counting from 0.\n3. After finding the row, we check the \"original air date\" column for the corresponding cell in that row. This will give us the actual air date for the specified episode.\n4. We compare the air date given in the claim with the air date found in step 3. If they match, it means the episode did air on the 7th of January as claimed, otherwise not.\n\nNow, let's format the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim (episode 11, 7th of Jan),\"\n                       \"Find the row for episode 11 (row 8),\"\n                       \"Check the air date for that row (7th of Jan).\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}]\n}\n```",
