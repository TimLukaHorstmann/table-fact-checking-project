Check if there exists any row in the data array where the 'venue' column matches 'the stoop'.\n3. If a match is found, then check the 'result' column of that row to ensure it indicates a win for the team (since the claim only mentions a score in the context of a win).\n4. If the result does indicate a win, then check the 'score' column of that row for the relevant score information (the team's score followed by a hyphen and then the opponent's score).\n5. Compare the extracted score from step 4 with the claim's score values (24 and 28 in this case). If they match, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nUsing this reasoning process:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check the venue for which we are looking\",\n    \"Find the relevant row where 'venue' matches 'the stoop'\",\n    \"Ensure that 'result' indicates a win\",\n    \"Extract the score from the 'score' column and compare it with the provided claim scores (24 - 28)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim statement: The claim states that \"mcnamara score 3 / 4 goal when the venue be the stoop\". This means we need to check if there are any rows where both conditions (scoring goals by mcnamara and playing at the stoop) are true.\n\n2. Identify the relevant columns: The claim refers to scoring goals, so we look for the \"goals\" column. Since the goal scorer is mentioned specifically as 'mcnamara', we will focus on the rows where 'goals' contains 'mcnamara'. The venue is also mentioned in the table, so we will check each row for the 'venue' column with a value of 'the stoop'.\n\n3. Iterate through the data: For each row in the table, check if both conditions are met (i.e., 'goals' contains 'mcnamara' and 'venue' is 'the stoop'). If so, collect that row's index as relevant.\n\n4. Determine the final answer: Check if any rows meet both conditions. If there are at least one such row, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"goals\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"venue\" }\n]\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify relevant columns (goals and venue)\",\n    \"Iterate through the data to find rows meeting both conditions\",\n    \"Determine if any such rows exist\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"goals\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"venue\" }\n  ]\n}",
