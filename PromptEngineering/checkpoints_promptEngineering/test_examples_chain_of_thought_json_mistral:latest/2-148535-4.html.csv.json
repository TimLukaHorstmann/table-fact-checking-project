    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the hand that matches the description given in the claim, which is \"four aces\".\n2. Check the data row for this hand to find the corresponding credit values for different numbers of credits. The relevant row index would be 2 (since \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\" and \"four aces\" are assumed to be the same hand).\n3. Look at the columns with the credit values, which correspond to the number of credits. In this case, we are interested in the first and fifth columns as they represent 1 credit and 5 credits respectively.\n4. Compare the values in the identified columns for the relevant row. For 1 credit, the value is \"160\", and for 5 credits, the value is \"2000\".\n5. The claim states that four aces win 800 at 5 credits but only 160 at 1 credit. Since the values found in the table match this condition (160 for 1 credit and 2000 for 5 credits), the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the hand described in the claim\", \"Find the row index of this hand\", \"Check the credit values for different numbers of credits\", \"Compare the credit values at 1 and 5 credits as per the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the hand type that corresponds to \"four aces\". In this case, it's the 4th row of the data array with the first column (hand) containing the value \"four aces\".\n2. Determine the credit value for this hand type. To find the reward for 1 credit, we need to look at the second column (1 credit) of the corresponding row in the data array.\n3. Compare the claim with the found result. The claim states that four aces yield 900 for 5 credits and the result for 1 credit would be 160. If we divide the value in the second column (160) by 5, it should equal the reward for 5 credits (900), which is not the case here (160 / 5 != 900). However, if we compare the found result (160) with the claim's expected result for 1 credit (160), it matches.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the hand type (four aces) and its associated reward for 1 credit\", \"Compare the found reward with the claim's expected result for 1 credit\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"hand\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}]\n}",
