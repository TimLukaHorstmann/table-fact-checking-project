    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify the series and season related to the episode with production code 201a. To do this, we need to find the row containing the production code 201a and then examine its columns \"no in series\" and \"no in season\".\n\n2. Determine if the director of the identified episode is igor kovalyov. This can be done by examining the column \"directed_by\" for the same row.\n\n3. Find the title of the identified episode. To do this, we need to examine the column \"title\" for the same row.\n\n4. Compare the results from steps 1, 2, and 3 with the claim to see if they match.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in series\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in season\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"directed_by\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"title\" }\n]\n\nThe answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
