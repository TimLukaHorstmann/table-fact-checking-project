Understand the table structure: The table provides data about various teams, including their location, venue, capacity, and position in 2003. The position in 2003 is represented as an integer (1 for first place, 2 for second place, etc.).\n\n3. Find the relevant rows: To answer the claim, we need to find the rows for Neman and Belshina in the table. The row_index for Neman is 7 and for Belshina is 20.\n\n4. Compare the positions: Once we have the two relevant rows, we can compare their position values. In this case, the position value for Neman (row_index=7) is \"7\" and for Belshina (row_index=20) is \"10\".\n\n5. Determine the answer: Since the position number for Neman (7) is greater than the position number for Belshina (10), it means that Neman has a higher position in 2003 compared to Belshina.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Find the relevant rows for Neman and Belshina\",\n    \"Compare the positions of the two teams\",\n    \"Determine if Neman's position is higher than Belshina's\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\" }\n  ]\n}",
