Instead, I can check if all the institutions listed are part of ACC (Atlantic Coast Conference) as they seem to be colleges within the same geographical area and have similar names.\n4. To verify whether these institutions are members of the ACC, one possible approach is to search for the list of ACC member institutions online and compare them with the ones in our table.\n5. If it turns out that all (or most) of the institutions in the table are part of the ACC, we can infer that they might participate in challenges involving ACC teams but not necessarily a \"big ten challenge\" as mentioned in the claim.\n6.
