    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to identify the structures built before 1950 (the cutoff date for comparison). From the data provided, there are nine structures, but only five were built before 1950. They are:\n   - White Tower (row 0)\n   - Old St. Paul's Cathedral (row 1)\n   - Southwark Cathedral (row 2)\n   - Monument to the Great Fire of London (row 3)\n   - St. Mary-le-Bow (row 4)\n   - St. Paul's Cathedral (row 5)\n\n2. Next, we need to find the three most recent tallest structures. From the data provided, these are:\n   - Battersea Power Station (row 6)\n   - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station (row 7)\n   - One Canada Square (row 8)\n   - Shard London Bridge (row 9), but since its height and years as tallest are still ongoing, we cannot compare it with the structures before 1950. Thus, we will only consider the first three.\n\n3. Now, let's compare the heights of these most recent tallest structures with those built before 1950. We will convert all heights to feet for a fair comparison since the claim uses feet:\n   - Battersea Power Station (62ft + 370ft = 432ft)\n   - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station (219ft)\n   - One Canada Square (235ft)\n   - White Tower (90ft / 304.8 feet per meter, so 90 * 3.28084 = 292.7 feet)\n   - Old St. Paul's Cathedral (493ft / 1640.44 feet per meter, so 493 * 0.305 = 150.2 feet)\n   - Southwark Cathedral (163ft / 518.16 feet per meter, so 163 * 0.305 = 50.1 feet)\n   - Monument to the Great Fire of London (202ft / 614.76 feet per meter, so 202 * 0.305 = 61.9 feet)\n   - St. Mary-le-Bow (236ft / 722.38 feet per meter, so 236 * 0.305 = 72.1 feet)\n   - St. Paul's Cathedral (365ft / 1174.92 feet per meter, so 365 * 0.305 = 112.8 feet)\n\n4. Finally, let's compare the heights of the most recent tallest structures with those built before 1950. We see that all three (Battersea Power Station, Crystal Palace Transmitting Station, One Canada Square) are at least 200 feet taller than the White Tower and Old St. Paul's Cathedral. However, only Battersea Power Station and One Canada Square are at least 200 feet taller than Southwark Cathedral, Monument to the Great Fire of London, and St. Mary-le-Bow. Therefore, it is not strictly true that all three of the most recent tallest structures are at least 200 foot taller than everything built before 1950, but only two (Battersea Power Station and One Canada Square) meet this criterion.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the five structures built before 1950.\",\n    \"Identify the three most recent tallest structures.\",\n    \"Compare the heights of these structures.\",\n    \"Check whether all three are at least 200 feet taller than everything built before 1950.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" }\n  ]\n}",

Check the gap in time: The \"st mary - le - bow\" was no longer the tallest after 1710, and the \"shard london bridge\" became the tallest in 2010.

There is only one row with such an end year (1991), which is \"one canada square\".\n5. Evaluate the comparison: The height of \"shard london bridge\" is 306 feet or 1004 metres, and that of \"one canada square\" is 235 feet or 771 metres. Since neither structure meets the 200 feet requirement for \"shard london bridge\", the height of \"crystal palace transmitting station\" (which also comes after 1950) doesn't need to be compared because it has already been established that the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the latest structure\",\n    \"Find the other 2 structures before this one\",\n    \"Compare the heights\",\n    \"Evaluate the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that just under 3 centuries pass before Southwark has the tallest building or structure.\n2. Understand the context: The table provides data about different buildings or structures, their names, locations, years they were the tallest, height in metres and floors (if applicable).\n3. Determine the relevant rows for Southwark: In this case, we need to look at the rows where the \"location\" is 'southwark'.\n4. Identify the timeline of when each building in Southwark was the tallest: By looking at the \"years as tallest\" column, we can see that Southwark cathedral was the tallest from 1666 to 1677, and then St Mary - le - Bow was taller from 1683 to 1710.\n5. Compare the timelines: To determine if just under 3 centuries pass before Southwark has the tallest building or structure again, we need to find a point in time where a taller building in Southwark appears after 1710 (the end of the timeline for St Mary - le - Bow).\n6. Find the relevant row with a taller building in Southwark: The Shard London Bridge is listed as being taller than any other structure in Southwark, and its \"years as tallest\" starts from 2010 (well after 1710).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Understand context\", \"Determine relevant rows for Southwark\", \"Identify timeline of each building in Southwark\", \"Compare timelines\", \"Find relevant row with a taller building in Southwark\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}]\n}",
