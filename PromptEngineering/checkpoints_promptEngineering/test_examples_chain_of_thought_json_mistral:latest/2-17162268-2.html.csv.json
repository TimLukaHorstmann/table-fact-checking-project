Otherwise, compare the total scores of the Australian players and select the one with the highest total score.\n6. Compare the highest total score of an Australian player with the total scores of all other players in the table to determine if it's indeed the highest out of all years.\n\nBased on the provided table, there is only one Australian player (David Graham) whose total score is 302. To find the highest total out of all the players in the table, we need to compare David Graham's score with every other player's score.
