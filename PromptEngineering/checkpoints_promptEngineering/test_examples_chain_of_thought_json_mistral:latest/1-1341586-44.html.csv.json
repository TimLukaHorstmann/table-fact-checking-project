    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Check the table for the row containing Henry B Gonzalez's information, as his name appears in the \"incumbent\" column of some rows in the table.\n2. Identify the row that matches the incumbent we are looking for by comparing its values with the known information about Henry B Gonzalez (e.g., party, first elected year, etc.). In this case, the matching row is located at index 20 in the \"data\" array.\n3. Examine the value of the \"candidates\" column for the identified row to check if Henry B Gonzalez was unopposed in the election. The value for that cell is \"henry b gonzalez (d) unopposed\".\n4. Confirm that there are no other candidates by looking at subsequent rows to see if anyone else ran against him in the district during that year's election. No such information exists beyond the given row.\n5. Based on the analysis of the table, we can conclude that Henry B Gonzalez was indeed unopposed in the election and no one else vied for his seat during that time period.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the row containing Henry B Gonzalez's information\",\n    \"Confirm if Henry B Gonzalez was unopposed in the election by examining the 'candidates' column value\",\n    \"Verify that there are no other candidates running against him during that year's election\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"candidates\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Examine the candidates column in the identified row to see who else ran against Albert Bustamante in Texas District 23 during that election year\n4.
