    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the opponent for which we need to find the attendance. In this case, it is the Buffalo Sabres.\n   2. Loop through each row of data in the table starting from the first row (row_index 0) and ending at the last row (len(data)-1).\n   3. Compare the opponent column value for each row with the given opponent (Buffalo Sabres).\n   4. If a match is found, note down the index of that row (matching_row_index) as we will need it later.\n   5. If no match is found after checking all rows, then the claim is false and there's no need to proceed further.\n\nNow let's check if there's a match:\nThe opponent column values are \"washington capitals\", \"carolina hurricanes\", \"atlanta thrashers\", \"phoenix coyotes\", \"anaheim ducks\", \"los angeles kings\", \"san jose sharks\", \"philadelphia flyers\", \"florida panthers\", \"dallas stars\", \"buffalo sabres\", \"carolina hurricanes\" and \"philadelphia flyers\".\nWe are looking for the row with the opponent value as \"buffalo sabres\". The matching row is found in the 15th row, with a row_index of 14.\n\nNow let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the opponent for which we need to find the attendance.\",\n    \"Loop through each row in the table and compare the opponent column value with the given opponent (Buffalo Sabres).\",\n    \"If a match is found, note down the index of that row as we will need it later.\",\n    \"If no match is found after checking all rows, then the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
