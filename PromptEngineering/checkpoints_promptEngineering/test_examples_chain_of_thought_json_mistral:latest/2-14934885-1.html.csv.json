The performers are in columns \"performer 1\", \"performer 2\", \"performer 3\", \"performer 4\".\n2. Scan through the rows of the table to find a match for \"hugh laurie\" among the performer columns. We find that \"hugh laurie\" appears in the second row, specifically in the \"performer 3\" column.\n3. Check if there is only one episode where \"hugh laurie\" appears as a performer. From the table data, we see that \"hugh laurie\" appears as the third performer in episode number 2 (row index 1).\n4. Compare this appearance with all other episodes by looking at the values in the \"performer 3\" column for each row. We find that only one episode has \"hugh laurie\" in the \"performer 3\" position, so he only appears as a performer in one episode.\n5. Compare the role of \"hugh laurie\" (third performer) in this single appearance with the total number of appearances in this episode. In the second row (episode 2), we find that \"hugh laurie\" is indeed the third performer, so he fills exactly the third position among all performers in this episode.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names for data\", \"Scan table to find 'hugh laurie'\", \"Check if there's only one appearance of 'hugh laurie'\", \"Compare the role of 'hugh laurie' with total number of appearances in this episode\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"performer 3\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}]\n}",

Find the row corresponding to episode 3: To find the fourth performer in this episode, we need to locate the row where the \"episode\" value is equal to 3. In our table, the third row has an \"episode\" value of 3.\n\n4. Identify the performers in the row: Now that we have the correct row, we can look at its \"performer\" columns to find out who the performers were in this episode. The performers for this episode are (\"john sessions\", \"stephen fry\", \"nonny williams\", \"jimmy mulville\").\n\n5. Check if jimmy mulville is the 4th performer: To check whether Jimmy Mulville is indeed the fourth performer, we can compare his position in the list of performers (4) with the order of their appearance in the row. In this case, Jimmy Mulville appears as the fourth performer.\n\n6.
