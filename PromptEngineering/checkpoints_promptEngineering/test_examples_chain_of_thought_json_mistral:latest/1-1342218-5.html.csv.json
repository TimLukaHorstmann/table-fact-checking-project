Extract relevant data from the table to compare with the given claim:\n   - Find the row corresponding to Arkansas 2 in the data array (row_index = 1).\n   - Extract the incumbent column value from that row (incumbent = \"wilbur mills\").\n   - Compare this with the name given in the claim (Wilbur mill). They match.\n   - Check if there is any other candidate for Arkansas 2:\n      - Extract candidates from the same row (candidates = \"wilbur mills (d) unopposed\").\n      - Look for another candidate in the candidates string: if the string does not contain \"and\" or \",\", then it indicates that there is no other candidate.
