    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column names to look for: We are given a claim about the location attendance for game number 1 (row index 0). So, we will focus on finding the values of the \"location\" (column name 6) and the row with an index of 0.\n2. Check the data: Look at each row in the table to find the required row index (in this case, row 0) and check its corresponding column for the location (column 6). The relevant cell here is [0, \"location attendance\"].\n3. Compare the values: Inspect the value found in step 2 against the claim statement. If it matches, then the claim is true; otherwise, false. In our case, the value of the \"location\" for game number 1 (row 0) is \"boston garden\", which matches the claim's location (\"boston garden\").\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the relevant row and column indexes for the given game in the table.\", \"Check the value of the 'location attendance' column for the given row.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to check the claim:\n\n1. Identify the games taking place at Boston Garden by filtering the table data based on the \"location attendance\" column value of \"Boston garden\". This will give us a subset of rows that represent the games played at Boston garden.\n\n2. Iterate through this filtered data to find the number of wins and losses for Detroit Pistons at Boston garden. To do this, check the \"score\" column to see if it starts with 'w' (indicating a win) or 'l' (indicating a loss). Sum the count of rows where the score starts with 'w' to get the number of wins and the count of rows where the score starts with 'l' to get the number of losses.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of games played at Boston garden by simply counting the total number of rows obtained in step 1.\n\n4. To find out if the claim is true, compare the calculated values from steps 2 and 3.
