However, since all the given data is related to French football, we can assume that any player who has ever played in France is likely to have played for PSG at some point (PSG being one of the top clubs in France).\n2. Next, we need to count the number of players in the table who are not of French nationality. To do this, we will iterate through each row and check the value in the \"column_name\": \"Nationality\" for each player. If the nationality is not France, then we can add that player to our count.\n3. After counting the number of players who are not of French nationality, we compare this count with 10.
