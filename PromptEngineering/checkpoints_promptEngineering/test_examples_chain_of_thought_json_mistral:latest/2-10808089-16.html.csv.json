    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim's conditions: The claim states that on August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne and the home team was Collingwood.\n\n2. Check if there are any rows in the table that match the specified date (August 13th, 1966).\n\n3. For each row that matches the date, compare the away team and home team values with the claimed teams (North Melbourne and Collingwood respectively).\n\n4. If a row contains both North Melbourne as the away team and Collingwood as the home team, then the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Reasoning Steps 2 and 3 do not require specific cell references as they involve checking all rows that match the specified date. If the claim is found to be true, then the relevant cells would be represented by the row indexes where the teams match the claimed teams.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the conditions of the claim\",\n    \"Check for rows that match the specified date\",\n    \"Compare the away team and home team values with the claimed teams\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
