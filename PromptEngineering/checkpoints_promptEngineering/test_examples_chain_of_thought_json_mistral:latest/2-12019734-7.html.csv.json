Since we want to find the score of a game played by the New Jersey team, we need to find a row in the data that matches this team. We compare each row's fourth column (home) with the target team. In this case, the fifth and sixth rows match the condition because both have \"new jersey\" as their home team.\n3. For each matching row, check if the second column (visitor) is empty or not. If it's empty, that means the game was played at home for the New Jersey team, and we can find the score in the third column (score). Since both rows have values in the visitor column, neither of them represents a home game for the New Jersey team.\n4.
