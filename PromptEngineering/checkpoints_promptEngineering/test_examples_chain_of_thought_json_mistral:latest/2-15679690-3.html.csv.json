From the data, it can be observed that he appears during seasons 1989-90, 1990-91, 1992-93, and 1993-94, not in 1983-84 or 1984-85.\n\n2. However, the claim doesn't specify that the award is for Ralph Sampson, but rather \"award of Ralph Sampson\". So, we should look for any awards given to him during these seasons.\n\n3. In the data, awards are given in the \"MVP\" (Most Valuable Player) and \"ROY\" (Rookie Of The Year) columns. For Ralph Sampson, he won ROY in 1984-85 according to the data provided.\n\n4. Now, since the award is not mentioned for the 1983-84 season, we cannot confirm whether he received an award during that season based on this data alone. However, the claim specifies \"season 1983-84 and in season 1984-85\", so we can say that there is a match for the second part of the claim (1984-85).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find Ralph Sampson's appearance in the data, look for any awards given to him during these seasons (1983-84 and 1984-85), check if award is specified as MVP or ROY\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"MVP\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"ROY\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
