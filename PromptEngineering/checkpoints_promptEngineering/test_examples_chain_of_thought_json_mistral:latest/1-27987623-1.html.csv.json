Determine the \"season episode\" of \"all mixed up\": From the first row of the table, we can see that the \"season episode\" of \"all mixed up\" is 25.

In this table, there are no rows with a smaller \"season episode\". This means that \"all mixed up\" is the only episode available in this table from its season.\n5. Compare the views of \"all mixed up\" with other episodes: Since we've found that \"all mixed up\" is the only episode from its season, we can directly compare its \"us viewers (in million)\" value (8.32) to itself.
