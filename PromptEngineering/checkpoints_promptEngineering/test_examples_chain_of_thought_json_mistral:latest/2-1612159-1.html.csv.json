In the data, the seasons are listed as individual years, so we will look for a row where the season value is within this range.\n\n2. Check the position column for the corresponding season. The position should be 13 if the claim is true.\n\n3. Check the head coach column for the corresponding season. According to the claim, the head coach for the 2011 - 2012 season should be \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\". We will check if there is a row where the head coach value matches this string.\n\n4. If both checks pass, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n\n1. To find the correct row for the 2011 - 2012 season, we would loop through the data and check for rows where the 'season' value is greater than or equal to 2011 and less than or equal to 2012. In this case, the relevant cell is: { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"season\" }\n\n2. To find the position for the 2011 - 2012 season, we would check the 'pos' column in the row found above. In this case, the relevant cell is: { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"pos\" }\n\n3. To find if the head coach for the 2011 - 2012 season matches the claim, we would check the 'head coach' column in the row found above.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify the season in question: The claim mentions the season from 2011 - 2012, so we will look for rows where the \"season\" column contains a value close to this range.\n\n2. Check if the head coach during the identified season is a match with the coaches listed in the claim: We will compare the \"head coach\" column of the selected row(s) with the coaches given in the claim (protasov, lyutyi talalayev, balakhnin, baidachny).\n\n3. Check if the position during the identified season matches the one mentioned in the claim: We will compare the \"pos\" column of the selected row(s) with the position given in the claim (13th).\n\n4. If all the above conditions are met for a single row, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n- First, we need to find rows with seasons close to 2011 - 2012.

However, it's important to note that the head coach is typically represented by a single individual in this dataset.\n\nSince there's no clear indication that all the coaches listed in the claim are present as a single entry for a specific row, we cannot confirm that the claim is TRUE based on this data alone. In real-world scenarios, you would need additional information to draw definitive conclusions.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the season in question\",\n    \"Check if the head coach during the identified season matches the coaches listed in the claim\",\n    \"Check if the position during the identified season matches the one mentioned in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"season\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"pos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"head coach\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
