The `columns` section lists the column names, while the `data` section contains a list of sublists, each representing a row. Each row corresponds to a specific month and browser usage data.\n\n2. Identify the claim. The claim states that in \"september 2011\", Internet Explorer was 38.85% when Firefox was 24.98%.\n\n3. Find the relevant rows. To check the data for the specific month, we need to find the row where the \"date\" column matches \"september 2011\". We can iterate through the `data` list and find the row index that corresponds to the desired date.\n\n4. Extract the relevant data. Once we have found the correct row index, we can extract the data for Internet Explorer (column with the name \"internet explorer\") and Firefox (column with the name \"firefox\"). The values for these columns at this specific row will give us the percentages of usage for both browsers in September 2011.\n\n5. Compare the extracted data.
