Verify that this row also contains \"united states\" as the \"country\", because the claim does not specify that he won for Wales or any other country.\n4. Look for multiple years of wins indicated by a comma-separated list, and check if they include \"1977\" and/or \"1981\". This will help us determine whether Watson actually won in those years according to the data provided.\n5. If the years checked match the ones found, look for the corresponding total score in the \"total\" column, since the claim states that Watson parred a total of 161.\n6.
