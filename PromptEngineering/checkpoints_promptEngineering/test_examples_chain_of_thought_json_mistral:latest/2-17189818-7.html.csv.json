    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the criteria for the claim: The player must have 4 played, a qual of 'rl', and 100 jermuk points, and their nalchik points should be less than 140.\n\n2. Filter the data based on the first two criteria: Find the players who have 4 games played (played column = 4) and a qual of 'rl' (qual column = 'rl'). This will give us a subset of players to focus on.\n\n3. Further filter this subset by nalchik points: From the remaining players, check their nalchik points. If any of them have nalchik points less than 140, then we can confirm that at least one player meets all three criteria and the claim is true. Otherwise, if none of the remaining players meet this criterion, the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the three conditions for the claim\",\n    \"Filter the data based on the first two conditions\",\n    \"Check if any of the remaining players meet the third condition (nalchik < 140)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"qual\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nalchik\" }\n  ]\n}",
