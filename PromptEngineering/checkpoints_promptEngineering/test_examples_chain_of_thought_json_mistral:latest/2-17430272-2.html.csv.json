The claim states that this match occurred against \"valentijn overeem\".\n\n2. Compare the names of the fighters mentioned in the table with the name given in the claim. If they match, proceed to the next step.\n\n3. Look for the row where the opponent's name matches Valerij Overeem (or Valentijn Overeem, as it appears in the table). In this case, it is the 10th row.\n\n4. Check the \"method\" column of the identified row to find out how the match was won. If the method was a submission, proceed to the next step.\n\n5. Look for the method listed in the \"method\" column of the identified row. The method should be specified as a submission. In this case, it is indeed a submission.\n\n6. Check the type of submission used. The claim states that the submission was via an achilles lock.\n\n7. Look for the exact type of submission listed in the \"method\" column of the identified row.

    "resp": "Reasoning Steps:\n1. Identify the structure of the table, noting that it has two main sections: \"columns\" which define the headers, and \"data\" which contains the rows.\n2. Compare the claim with the data in the table, looking for a row that matches the event mentioned in the claim.\n3. In this case, we are looking for an event named \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\". We observe that there is no exact match for this name in the 'event' column, so we will consider possible variations of it.\n4. Consider the possibility that the event might have been abbreviated or misspelled, and look for rows with similar names. In this table, some events are denoted using different naming conventions such as \"bars - bars\" or \"bars - moscow vs st petersburg\".\n5. Since we find a match in step 4, we look at the corresponding row for more information to determine if it's the event we are looking for. In this case, we find that the second-to-last row matches the conditions: \"win\", \"6 - 3\", \"stanislav nuschik\", \"tko\", \"bars - moscow vs st petersburg\", \"2\", \"moscow , russia\".\n6. Since we have found a row with an event name that closely resembles the one in our claim, and it seems to meet the condition of having 2 rounds (as indicated by 'round': '2'), we can conclude that this event could be what was intended in the claim.\n7. However, since there is no definitive match for \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\", we cannot confirm whether the event had exactly 2 rounds as per the original claim.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Compare claim to table data\",\n    \"Look for possible variations of the event name\",\n    \"Find a match with similar naming conventions\",\n    \"Analyze matching row for details\",\n    \"Consider if this event could be what was intended in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE (with caveats)\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\" }\n  ]\n}",
