Understand the table structure: The table has five columns - \"place\", \"player\", \"country\", \"score\", and \"to par\". The \"score\" column contains the players' scores, which are expressed as a sum of two numbers (e.g., \"69 + 67 = 136\").\n3. Find Tim Herron's row: Scan through the data to find the row where the player is Tim Herron. The relevant row in this case is the third row, since it contains \"tim herron\".\n4. Interpret the score for Tim Herron: In the \"score\" column of the relevant row, we see that his score is represented as a sum (69 + 67 = 136).\n5. Compare with the claim: Compare the calculated score for Tim Herron with the claimed score. The calculated score is 136, which matches the claimed score.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Find Tim Herron's row\",\n    \"Interpret the score for Tim Herron\",\n    \"Compare with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Find matches: Fred Funk's score of 138 matches the scores (i.e., 138) in the rows number 9, 10, and 11, which are labeled as t8.

Columns include place, player, country, score (in the format of two rounds added together), and to par (the difference between their total score and par).\n\n3. Find the row(s) that match Fred Funk's information: In this table, there is only one row where the player column matches \"Fred funk\". The score column also matches the claimed score of 138 in this row.\n\n4. Compare the place value between the identified row and all other rows with the same score (138): To do this, we need to know how the table is sorted, but since it doesn't specify an ordering, we can assume that the first row for each unique score represents a placement of 't' followed by its position in tournament. In our case, Fred Funk's row has \"t8\" which indicates his placement in the tournament among those with a total score of 138.\n\n5.
