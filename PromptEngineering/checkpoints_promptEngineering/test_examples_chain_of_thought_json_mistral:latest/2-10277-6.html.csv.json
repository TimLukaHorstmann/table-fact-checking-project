Extract the 'year' and 'project' columns from the table data, as these are relevant to determining if \"bulworth\" was nominated in 1999.\n2. Compare each project row's year with the expected year (1999) and check if they match for the row containing \"bulworth\".\n3. If a matching year is found for the row containing \"bulworth\", then the claim is true, as that would mean \"bulworth\" was nominated in 1999.\n4. If no matching year is found for the row containing \"bulworth\", then the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the claim using the given table:\n\nAfter examining the table data, I found that the relevant cells are as follows:\n- Relevant Cells: [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"project\"}]\n\nWith this information, we can see that the 'year' for the row containing \"bulworth\" is 1999. Hence, the answer to the claim is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted relevant columns to determine if \\\"bulworth\\\" was nominated in 1999.
