In this table, only two plays are from these countries: \"electra\" (Romania) and \"plutus\" (Cyprus).\n2. Compare the rows containing these plays to determine which one comes first in the order. The row index is used as a sorting criteria since the order of data within each row doesn't have any inherent meaning. In this table, the row index for \"electra\" is 0 and the row index for \"plutus\" is 1.
