    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"olimpia, in position 10, have 2 wins\".\n2. Understand the table structure: The table provides football team statistics for a certain league. Each row contains information about one team (position, name, etc.).\n3. Find the relevant data for 'olimpia': We need to find the row of the table where the team name is 'olimpia'. Since the team names are in column 1 (index 0) and each row's first element corresponds to the position, we look for a position equal to 10. In the table data, there's no such match for both position and team name. However, looking further down, we find the team 'olimpia' in row index 10 (the first element of this row is not 10 but 9, which corresponds to its position in a different order).\n4. Check if the team has 2 wins: In column 5 (index 4), we can see the number of wins for each team. For 'olimpia' at row index 10, there are 2 wins (the value is 2 under wins column).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: The claim states that 'olimpia' has 2 wins in position 10.\",\n    \"Understand table structure: The table provides football team statistics for a certain league.\",\n    \"Find relevant data for 'olimpia': Search for a position equal to 10 and team name 'olimpia'.\",\n    \"Check if the team has 2 wins: Find the number of wins for 'olimpia' in the column corresponding to wins.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
