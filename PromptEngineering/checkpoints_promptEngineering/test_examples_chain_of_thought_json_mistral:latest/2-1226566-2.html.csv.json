There are two unique entrants in the table: \"camel team lotus honda\" and \"tyrrell racing organisation\".\n2. Filter the data for each entrant to see how many times they have appeared as a chassis producer.\n3. For \"camel team lotus honda\", there are three rows where this entrant appears, indicating that they produced three different chassis. The relevant cells for this entrant are [0], [1] (entrant column), and [2] (chassis column) with row_index 0, 1, and 2 respectively.\n4. For \"tyrrell racing organisation\", there are five rows where this entrant appears, but it changes its chassis partner from Lotus to Tyrrell in 1989, so it effectively produced two different chassis: one with Lotus (in 1990 and 1991) and another with itself (in 1990 and 1991). The relevant cells for the rows where it partnered with Lotus are [2], [3] (entrant column), and [2] (chassis column) with row_index 0 and 1, and the relevant cells for the rows where it partnered with Tyrrell are [4], [5], [6], [7] (entrant column), and [2] (chassis column) with row_index 3, 4, and 5 respectively.\n5. Compare the number of chassis produced by each entrant. \"camel team lotus honda\" produced 3 chassis while \"tyrrell racing organisation\" produced 2 chassis (effectively) when partnered with a different manufacturer.\n6.

Compare the points earned by the engines (honda v6 and cosworth v8) to see if the difference is 3 or more.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table data:\n- honda v6 engine appears in rows with index 0 and 1 (years 1987 and 1988). Its points are 7 and 1 respectively.\n- cosworth v8 engine appears in rows with index 2, 3, 4, and 5 (years 1989, 1990 x2, and 1991). Its points are 3, 3, 3, and 0 respectively.\n\nComparing the points earned by the engines:\n- honda v6 has a total of 8 points (7+1), while cosworth v8 has a total of 6 points (3x2 + 0).\n- The difference between the total points earned by the two engines is 2, not 3.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the engines involved in the claim: honda v6 and cosworth v8.\",\n    \"Find the rows in the table where the engine column matches either honda v6 or cosworth v8.\",\n    \"For each row, find the points column value to get the points earned by each engine.\",\n    \"Compare the points earned by the engines (honda v6 and cosworth v8) to see if the difference is 3 or more.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}",
