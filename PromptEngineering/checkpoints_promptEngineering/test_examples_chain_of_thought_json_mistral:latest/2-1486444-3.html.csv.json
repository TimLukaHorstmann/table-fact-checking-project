To verify this, we need to check the location of each event mentioned in the dataset.\n2. In the dataset, we see a list of events with their locations. We will compare each location with \"Turku, Finland\".\n3. In the dataset, we find an event called \"shooto finland : the first time\" that took place in Turku, Finland. However, we need to confirm if it's the same event mentioned in the claim (shooto 2003: 3 / 18).\n4. To verify that they are the same events, we will compare the row indexes and column names of these two events. If they match in both aspects, then it's likely the same event.\n5. In the dataset, we find that \"shooto finland : the first time\" has a row_index=63 and column_name=\"event\". We will compare this with the potential match (\"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\").\n6. In the dataset, we find no event with the exact name \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\", but looking at the events' numbers, we can infer that they might be part of the same series. We will compare their row indices to confirm this.\n7. We find that \"shooto finland : the first time\" has a row_index=63 and \"shooto 2003: 8 / 10\" has a row_index=59. Since these are close in number, it's possible they belong to the same series.\n8. To confirm this, we will compare their column names as well. Both events have the same column name \"event\".\n9. If both events belong to the same series (i.e., share similar row indices and column names), it means that the event mentioned in Turku, Finland could be \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" or a subsequent event in the same series. To verify if an opponent of rumina sato was present in this event, we will search for events where rumina sato's name appears as an opponent.\n10. In the dataset, we find that Rumina Sato had a match against Takumi Nakayama (row_index=56) and no other opponent matches her name. We will check if either of these events took place in Turku, Finland.\n11. We find that \"shooto 2003: 8 / 10\" (the event where Takumi Nakayama fought Rumina Sato) did not take place in Turku, Finland.\n12. However, we also find that \"shooto finland : capital punishment 2\" (row_index=74) took place in Helsinki, Finland but had an opponent of Rumina Sato. This suggests that it could be the event in question, as it's a different event in the same series that took place in Finland.\n13. In conclusion, \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" does not have an opponent of Rumina Sato, but another event in the same series (\"shooto finland : capital punishment 2\") took place in Finland with Rumina Sato as an opponent.\n\nanswer: FALSE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\":63,\"column_name\":\"event\"}, {\"row_index\":56,\"column_name\":\"opponent\"}]",
