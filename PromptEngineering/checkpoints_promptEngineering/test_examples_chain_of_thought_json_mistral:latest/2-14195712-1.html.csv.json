However, considering that all the listed teams (Czechoslovakia, Soviet Union, Canada, Sweden, West Germany, United States, East Germany, Finland) are part of the current or historical geographical area known as Europe, and Europe is entirely within the Northern Hemisphere, we can infer that these teams are located in the northern hemisphere.\n4.

There are 8 rows of data, each representing a different team.\n\n2. Understand the claim: The claim is that there is an inverse correlation between the total points and the number of games lost. Inverse correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases, and vice versa.\n\n3. Extract the relevant columns: \"points\" (total points) and \"lost\" (number of games lost).\n\n4. Compare each team's total points with their number of games lost. If teams with higher numbers of games lost have lower total points, and teams with lower numbers of games lost have higher total points, then the claim could be supported.\n\n5. Analyze the data: Looking at the table, we see that teams with more losses (higher \"lost\" values) generally have lower total points (lower \"points\" values). For example, team \"united states\" and team \"east germany\", which both lost 5 games, have 3 points each. On the other hand, teams like \"czechoslovakia\" and \"soviet union\", which lost fewer or no games, have higher total points (14 and 12 respectively).\n\n6.
