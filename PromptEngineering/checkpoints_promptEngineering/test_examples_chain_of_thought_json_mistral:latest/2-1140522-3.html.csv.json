Find their corresponding rows in the table, noting the row indices for each class. For `gf25a`, the row index is 2, and for `gf30a`, the row index is 4.\n3.

Therefore, to find the number of products between `gf25a` and `gf30a`, we subtract the total produced for `gs4` from the total produced for `gf30a`. So, we have 5 - 46 = -41.\n8.
