Note that there are 6 players who have the same score (209) according to the 'score' column. This can be determined by finding the number of unique scores and comparing it with the total number of players (excluding the one in first place). In this case, there is only one unique score among the scores of players other than the winner (Lee Janzen with a score of 203), implying that all other players are tied.\n3. Check if these tied players have the same position ranking as per the 'place' column. Since they share the same position ('t6'), it confirms that they are indeed tied for sixth place.\n4. Compare the number of tied players (6) with the expected number of players in sixth place or higher, considering the total number of players (11). Since there is no need for more than 6 players to fill the positions from 6th place and beyond, the number of tied players matches the expected number.\n5.
