    "resp": "Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Identify the player in question: In this case, the player is \"geremi\".\n2. Find the row corresponding to the player in the table: We will look for a row where the value of the \"name\" column matches \"geremi\". In our table, we find that row index 35 corresponds to player geremi.\n3. Check the value of the relevant columns for the player: Since the claim is about the FIFA Club World Championship, we need to check the value in the \"fifa club world championship\" column for player geremi. For player geremi, the value in the \"fifa club world championship\" column is 1 (in row index 35).\n4. Compare the result with the claim: The claim states that \"player geremi have won only 1 FIFA Club World Championship\". From our table, we find that player geremi has indeed won exactly 1 FIFA Club World Championship, as stated in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player in question\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the player in the table\",\n    \"Check the value of the relevant columns for the player\",\n    \"Compare the result with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"fifa club world championship\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
