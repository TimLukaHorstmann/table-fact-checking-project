Also, the table only contains data for two drivers (Dick Johnson and John Bowe), which makes comparing their win counts easier.\n\nLet's count the wins for each driver by iterating through the rows of the table:\n- For Dick Johnson, we find 7 wins (in Amaroo, Launceston, Lakeside, Perth, Mallala, Sandown).\n- For John Bowe, we find 1 win (in Perth).\n\nSince Dick Johnson has 7 wins and John Bowe has 1 win, Dick Johnson won 6 more races than John Bowe in the table.
