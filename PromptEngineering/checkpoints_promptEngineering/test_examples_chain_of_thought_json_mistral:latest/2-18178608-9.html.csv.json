Find the matches where England was involved, as it's implied that these were the matches against England:\n    - First test match: Look for a row with Australia and \"against\" equal to England (or England is missing in the 'against' column).\n    - Second test match: Look for a row with Australia and \"against\" equal to England, and a 'status' value of 'test match'. This is because the claim specifies that it's during their second test match.\n3. Check the scores (points) from the identified matches to compare them with Australia's score against Wales (since it's the highest score in the table):\n    - For the first test match, get the score for the row identified in step 2 (if any). Compare this score with Australia's score against Wales. If the score against England is greater than or equal to the score against Wales, then the claim about the first test match holds true.\n    - For the second test match, simply compare the score from the row identified in step 2 with the scores of other rows where Australia scored against England and the status is 'test match' (if any).

Find all rows in the table that correspond to matches involving either IRE or SCO.\n3. For each row, extract the \"against\" column (opponent's team name) and the \"points\" column (number of points scored by the team).\n4. Compare the number of points scored by IRE against all opponents and find the minimum value. Let's call this value `min_IRE`.\n5. Compare the number of points scored by SCO against all opponents and find the second smallest value (after `min_IRE`). Let's call this value `second_min`.\n6. Check if `second_min` is equal to the points scored by SCO in a match against an opponent that is not IRE.\n\nNow let's find relevant cells:\n1. To find the minimum points scored by Ireland, we would need the rows with opponents for both Ireland and the other teams. So the relevant cells for this step are: [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"against\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"against\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, ...]\n2.

Let's assume it is 7 points in a match against an opponent that is not IRE.\n- The claim states that \"Scotland scores the second least amount of point\", which is NOT TRUE if we have found a smaller value for another team (e.g., Wales with 6 points). In this table, there seems to be no other team with fewer points than Scotland (7), so it can be assumed that Scotland does score the second least number of points.\n- However, the claim also states that \"Ireland scores the least amount of point against England and scotland score the second least amount\", which is FALSE because we have found a smaller value for Ireland (3) than for Scotland (7).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams in claim: IRE, SCO\",\n    \"Find rows corresponding to matches with IRE and SCO\",\n    \"Extract 'against' and 'points' columns for each row\",\n    \"Compare points scored by IRE against all opponents (find minimum value)\",\n    \"Compare points scored by SCO against all opponents (find second smallest value after the minimum found for IRE)\",\n    \"Check if the second smallest value is equal to the points scored by SCO in a match against an opponent that is not IRE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

Since 'England' is not listed in the given table, I cannot find any direct match for their matches. However, I can determine whether Scotland and Ireland competed against other teams during March 1988, which might indirectly imply that England could have played them as well.\n4. Check the date of each row to verify if there are any rows with a date in March of 1988.\n5. Based on the given data, I found two rows with dates in March 1988: Ireland (19/03/1988) and Scotland (05/03/1988).\n6. To see if these teams played against each other or another common opponent during that month, compare their respective opponents and dates.\n7. Scotland competed against Wales on 02/02/1988 and France on 05/03/1988 (which is after the specified March date). Ireland competed against Wales on 06/02/1988, England (not directly shown), and France on 19/03/1988.\n8. Given that both Scotland and Ireland had matches against other teams in March 1988 (including at least one common opponent: France) and we do not have direct evidence of their matches with England, it's reasonable to infer that they may have played against England during March 1988.\n9.
