    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the region for which we need to find the population change since 1993. In this case, it's \"tacna\".\n\n2. Find the row that corresponds to \"tacna\" in the table. This will help us identify the initial and current values of the 'population' column and the 'change in population since 1993'.\n\n3. Extract the initial value (from 1993) and the current value from the 'population' column for \"tacna\". We can see that the initial value is 274496 and the current value is also 274496 as there is no row in the table that refers to a year before 1993.\n\n4. Calculate the difference between the current value and the initial value (the change) to check if it matches with the given percentage change claimed (3% or 0.03). We can calculate the change as: Current value - Initial value = Change, so in this case: 274496 - 274496 = 0.\n\n5. Compare the calculated change with the given percentage change. If they are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false. In our case, 0 (the calculated change) does not match with 0.03 (the given percentage change), so the claim is false.\n\nNow let's output the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row corresponding to 'tacna'.\",\n    \"Extract the initial and current values of 'population' from the found row.\",\n    \"Calculate the change in population since 1993.\",\n    \"Compare the calculated change with the given percentage change.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"population\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Extract the relevant data from the table:\n   - Find the row index for 'lambayeque': Since the regions are listed in the order they appear in the json, we can use the index of the row containing 'lambayeque' (14th row).\n   - Check if the value for change in % of country's population since 1993 is equal to 0.0: The value at the intersection of the 14th row and the column 'change in % of countrys population since 1993' is \"0.0\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find relevant columns: region, change in % of countrys population since 1993\",\n    \"Extract relevant data from the table\",\n    \"Identify row index for 'lambayeque'\",\n    \"Check if value of change in % of country's population since 1993 is equal to 0.0\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
