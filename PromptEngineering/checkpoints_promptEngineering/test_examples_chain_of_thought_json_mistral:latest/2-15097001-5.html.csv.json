    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I need to identify the specific tournament match mentioned in the claim from the provided table. The tournament name, date, and date of the match in the claim are \"fab grand prix\", \"9 february 1992\".\n\n2. Next, I will search for a row in the data that matches these two conditions. In this case, the fifth row matches both the tournament name and the date.\n\n3. If a row is found, then the final score claimed can be verified by comparing it with the \"score in final\" column of the matching row. In this case, the score for the fifth row is \"5 - 7 , 3 - 6\", which matches the claimed score.\n\n4. Since the claimed score matches the score found in the table, my answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the tournament and date from the claim, Search for a row with matching values in the data, Verify the final score against the 'score in final' column of the matched row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score in final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
