    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The score of game 35 is \"l90 - 98 (ot)\". This means the team lost, the total points for the opposing team are 98, and the game went into overtime.\n\n2. Locate the row in the table that corresponds to game 35: The data array has an index of 5 which represents the fifth row in the table.\n\n3. Check the \"score\" column of the selected row: In this row, the value for the \"score\" column is \"l 117 - 122 (ot)\". This score does not match the claim since the total points for the team in this row are 117, not 98.\n\n4. Conclusion: The score of game 35 is not \"l90 - 98 (ot)\" as claimed.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: The score of game 35 is 'l90 - 98 (ot)' \",\n    \"Locate the row in the table that corresponds to game 35\",\n    \"Check the 'score' column of the selected row\",\n    \"Conclusion: The score of game 35 is not 'l90 - 98 (ot)' as claimed\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
