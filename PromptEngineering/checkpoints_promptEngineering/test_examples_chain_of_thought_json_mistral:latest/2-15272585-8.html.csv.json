We have four matches in the data, but only two of them are on hard courts:\n   - Row 0: Hard (i)\n   - Row 2: Clay\n   - Row 3: Hard\n   - Row 4: Clay\n\n3. Count the number of matches played on a hard court for each player. Since we're looking for Galina Voskoboeva, we won't find any matches in this table because she is not listed as an opponent or winner. However, to determine if anyone has played 3 games on a hard tennis court, let's first count the matches on hard courts:\n   - In row 0, the opponent is Matea Mezak, so we don't need to consider this match for Galina Voskoboeva.\n   - In row 3, there is no indication of the player on the hard court.\n   - In row 4, there is no hard court.\n\n4.

Check if there is another instance where galina voskoboeva played against the same opponent on a different date: In this table, there is only one occurrence of repeated opponents - alice canepa in row 4 (6 june 2006).\n4. Compare the specified date for the repeated opponent to determine if it supports the claim: The claim suggests that galina voskoboeva played the same opponent more than once, except on 6 june 2006.
