Identify the condition to be checked in the claim: The title name for \"little one\" under the \"epic\" label in the format of \"stereo lp\" has a catalog - nr of \"bn26350 (stereo)\".\n2. Extract all rows that meet the first two conditions: region = \"usa\", label = \"epic\", and title contains \"little one\" and format = \"stereo lp\". From the data, only the 7th and 8th rows match these conditions.\n3. Check if any of the extracted rows also meet the third condition (catalog - nr = \"bn26350 (stereo)\"). The catalog number for both the 7th and 8th rows is listed as \"ln24350\" and \"bn26350 (stereo)\", respectively.\n4.
