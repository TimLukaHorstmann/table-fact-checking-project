If we had the correct information about \"jackie oliver\", we would proceed as follows:\n   - Identify the team we are looking for: The claim mentions \"gold leaf team auto\". However, there is no such team listed in the table. There are only two teams that repeatedly appear under \"gold leaf team lotus\" for years 1968 and 1969 (i.e., gold leaf team lotus with chassis lotus 49 and lotus 49b). It is unclear if these teams are the same as \"gold leaf team auto\".\n   - Identify the points earned by this driver-team combination: To do this, we would need to find rows in the table where both the entrant column matches our team (either gold leaf team lotus, gold leaf team auto) and the row's year corresponds to the years when \"jackie oliver\" was driving.

Since \"owen racing organization\" did not participate in any races after 1970, the last row associated with this team is the relevant one for our analysis (row index: 6).\n   4. Next, we check if there is a row for Jackie Oliver's last race with \"marlboro brm\".

Narrow down the list of entrants to those who might be Jackie Oliver as the table does not provide specific names: Those who have raced for teams with \"Jackie\" in their name or a name similar enough that it could plausibly be him (e.g., if a team's name is Johnnie Racing, we can still consider it as potentially representing Jackie Oliver) are gold leaf team lotus (as 'jackie' and 'johnnie' sound alike), bruce mclaren motor racing (as 'bruce' could be interpreted as a nickname for 'jackie'), and possibly marlboro brm (if 'marlboro' is short for something that sounds like \"Jackie\" or has a strong connection to him).\n3. Check the row_index of each potentially relevant entrant to see if they raced from 1967 - 1977: gold leaf team lotus (row index [0,1]), bruce mclaren motor racing (row index [10,11]), marlboro brm (row index [8,3])\n4. Count the number of times each potentially relevant entrant raced during 1967 - 1977: gold leaf team lotus raced in rows 0 and 1 (2 times), bruce mclaren motor racing raced in rows 10 and 11 (2 times), marlboro brm raced in row 8 (1 time)\n5. Compare the count with the claim requirement: To compete in over 15 races from 1967 - 1977, an entrant must have raced at least 16 times. However, none of the potentially relevant entrants meet this requirement (gold leaf team lotus: 2 times, bruce mclaren motor racing: 2 times, marlboro brm: 1 time)\n6.

Although we can't find any specific driver named Jackie Oliver in the table, it's important to note that the entrant column may not always contain the actual driver's name, but rather the team or organization they represented.

Scan through the data column looking for a row where the chassis column matches \"brm p153\".\n5. Identify the rows (0, 8 and 9) that contain \"brm p153\" as the chassis.\n6. Check if these rows also have \"brm v12\" as the engine in the engine column to confirm the claim.\n7.
