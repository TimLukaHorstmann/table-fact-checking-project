Identify the two key pieces of information required to validate the claim: the series number for which Michael Lembeck directed, and the title of the episode he directed with that specific series number.\n2. Loop through the table data to find the rows where the \"directed by :\" column has the value \"michael lembeck\". This will provide us with a list of episodes directed by Michael Lembeck.\n3. For each episode in step 2, check if there exists a corresponding row in the same dataset where the \"series\" column matches the series number found in step 1 and the \"title\" column matches the title of the episode found in step 2. This will verify that Michael Lembeck directed an episode within a specific series with the given title.\n4. Based on the results from steps 2 and 3, determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key pieces of information required to validate claim.\",\n    \"Loop through data to find episodes directed by Michael Lembeck\",\n    \"For each episode, check if it matches the specified series and title.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"series\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"title\" }\n  ]\n}",
