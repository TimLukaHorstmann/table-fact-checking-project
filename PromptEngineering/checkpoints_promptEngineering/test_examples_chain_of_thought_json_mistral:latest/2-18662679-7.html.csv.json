Check if the number of rowers is consistent: Compare the number of comma-separated strings within the rowers' field with 4 for each row. If they are equal, it would support the claim; otherwise, it contradicts the claim.\n\n5. Final answer: Based on the table, we can see that the number of rowers varies across different rows. Some teams have 4 members (e.g., row 1, row 2, and row 3), while others have fewer than 4 members (row 4, row 5, and row 6).

Identify relevant columns that may contain the information needed to answer the question. For this claim, we are interested in the \"rank\" and \"time\" columns because they can help us compare the speeds of different teams.\n3. Sort the data by rank (1 being the fastest) and time to facilitate comparison between countries. In our table, Poland is ranked 1 and Germany is ranked 3.\n4. Compare the times of the respective teams in the first row (Poland) and third row (Germany).\n5. The time for Poland's team is \"5:51.29\", while Germany's team has a time of \"5:53.56\".\n6. Determine if the difference between the times is more than 1 minute. To do so, convert both times to seconds as follows:\n   - Poland's time: 5 minutes and 51.29 seconds = 5 * 60 + 51.29 = 351.29 seconds\n   - Germany's time: 5 minutes and 53.56 seconds = 5 * 60 + 53.56 = 353.56 seconds\n7. Calculate the difference between both times (difference > 60 seconds indicates more than 1 minute): 353.56 - 351.29 = 2.27\n8. The time difference is 2.27 seconds, which is less than 60 seconds.
