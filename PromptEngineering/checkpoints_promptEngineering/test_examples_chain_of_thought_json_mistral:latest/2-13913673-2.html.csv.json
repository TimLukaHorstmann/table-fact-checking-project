If found, it would mean more than one game was postponed, so the claim is false.\n\n3. Since no other game is marked as postponed in the dataset, we can confirm that only the April 23 game against the Royals was postponed.\n\n4.

In this case, it's clear that the \"Score\" field doesn't refer to attendance since it has game results and not numbers. The other columns seem to be related to date, pitchers or teams, so they can probably be ruled out as well. However, the only remaining column appears to be the one with the total count at the end of each row, which we'll call \"Attendance\".\n\n2. Find the row that corresponds to the game against the white sox on March 31 by comparing the date in the rows with the given date. In this table, dates are represented as a combination of team and pitcher, but since we know the opponent is the white sox and can't be certain about the pitcher, we'll make an assumption that all the games in March have only one row each (as it seems to be the case in the provided data). So, we should look for the game that occurred on March 31.\n\n3. Once the correct row is identified, check the value in the \"Attendance\" column for that row.
