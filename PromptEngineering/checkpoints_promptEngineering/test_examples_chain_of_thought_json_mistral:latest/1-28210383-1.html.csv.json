In our data, there are 6 episodes that match this condition.\n\n2. Next, for each of these episodes, we will look at their respective location to determine if they belong to a different geographic category. We can find the location information from the \"title\" column. The titles contain geographical locations like 'Rhode Island', 'Europe', 'Rupert', 'Germany', 'Multiverse' and 'North Pole'.\n\n3. To understand if these locations belong to different geographic categories, we can consider that the given table represents episodes of Family Guy, an American animated sitcom, which is set in Rhode Island, USA. Thus, it makes sense that the first episode 'Road to Rhode Island' does not represent a different geographical category. However, subsequent episodes are either entirely set outside of the United States or in fictional locations ('Multiverse').\n\n4. Finally, we compare these findings with the claim: \"each of the road to. family guy episodes have a location with a different geographic category, except road to rupert.\" Since all episodes (except 'Road to Rupert') do indeed feature locations outside the USA or in fictional locations, and 'Road to Rhode Island' was expected to be the same due to its connection to Family Guy's setting, the claim can be considered TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify episodes related to 'Road to...', Find the location of each episode, Compare the locations to determine geographic categories, Compare findings with the given claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"title\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}",
