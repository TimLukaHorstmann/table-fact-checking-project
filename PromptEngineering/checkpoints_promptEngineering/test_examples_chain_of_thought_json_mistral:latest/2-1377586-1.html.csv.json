Determine the data structure: The table is a JSON object with two main keys: \"columns\" and \"data\". \"Columns\" contains the column names, while \"data\" contains the rows (with each row being an array of values).\n3. Identify the relevant columns: Since we are comparing scores, we are interested in the score column (\"score\"). To identify the player who has the highest score, we need to compare all \"score\" values.\n4. Loop through the data: Iterate over each row (player) in the \"data\".\n5. Compare scores: For each player, get their score from the \"score\" column of the current row. If the current score is higher than any score we have seen so far, store it as the highest score.\n6. Check if the highest score was found: After looping through all players and comparing their scores, check if the highest score was found.\n7.
