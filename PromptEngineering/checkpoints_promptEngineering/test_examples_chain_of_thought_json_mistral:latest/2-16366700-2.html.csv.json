    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. The table provides data for various players, including their names, years played, regular season goals, playoffs goals, and total goals (regular + playoffs).\n2. We are asked to determine whether only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals in the regular season.\n3. To answer this question, we need to identify the number of players who have scored more than 300 goals in the regular season and check if that count is equal to 4.\n4. First, let's look for the rows where the 'years' column includes only the regular season years (excluding playoffs) since these are the relevant ones for our claim.\n5. We can see from the table that some players have multiple rows, but those represent different time periods of their career. However, we should consider each row individually as they may contain the necessary information to determine if a player scored more than 300 goals in the regular season.\n6. Now, let's examine each row one by one:\n   - Bobby Hull (row index 0): 604 goals in regular season.\n   - Stan Mikita (row index 1): 541 goals in regular season.\n   - Steve Larmer (row index 2): 406 goals in regular season.\n   - Denis Savard (row index 3 and 5): 377 goals in regular season (row 3) and 438 total goals (row 5, including playoffs).\n   - Dennis Hull (row index 4): 298 goals in regular season.\n   - Jeremy Roenick (row index 6): 267 goals in regular season.\n   - Tony Amonte (row index 7): 268 total goals (including playoffs).\n   - Hubert Pit Martin (row index 8): 243 goals in regular season.\n   - Bill Mosienko (row index 9): 258 goals in regular season.\n   - Ken Wharram (row index 10): 252 goals in regular season.\n7. From the examination, we can see that Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, Steve Larmer, Dennis Hull, Bill Mosienko, and Ken Wharram have scored more than 300 goals in the regular season (Bobby Hull being the only one with over 600).\n8.
