The earliest occurrence of a competition code in our table is 'ecqg5'.\n\n4. Check if there are multiple rows for the same venue: Look through the \"venue\" column to find repeated entries for Hampden Park, Glasgow. There are 4 instances where this venue appears.\n\n5. Consider the possibility of matches from different seasons being mixed in the table: Since we have no other evidence or information about the years, we cannot definitively say that all the matches belong to the 2003-04 season.
