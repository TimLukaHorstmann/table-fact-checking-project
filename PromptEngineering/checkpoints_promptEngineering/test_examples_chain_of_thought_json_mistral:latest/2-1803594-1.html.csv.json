Find the row corresponding to \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute\": We will search through all rows in the data section until we find the one where the name matches \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute\". In this case, it is at index 6.\n4. Extract the enrollment value for \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute\": We will look at the enrollment column of the row we found in step 3. The enrollment value for \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute\" is 1895 (at data[6][\"enrollment\"]).\n5. Compare the extracted enrollment value with the claimed highest enrollment: We will compare the extracted enrollment value of 1895 with the claimed highest enrollment of 1895.
