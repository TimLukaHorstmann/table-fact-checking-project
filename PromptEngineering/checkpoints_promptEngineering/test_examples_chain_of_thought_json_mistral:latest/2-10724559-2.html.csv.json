Since the 'all - time rank' column indicates the ranking from lowest to highest, I will start from the top and search for a rank equal to or greater than 53.\n\n2. Start with the first row in the data array (row_index=0). Check the value of the 'all - time rank' column: \"53\" matches the given claim. Thus, this player is the one we are looking for.\n\n3. Since the player with an all-time rank of 53 has been identified, I will now check the 'apps' column to verify whether their number of appearances (apps) is equal to 258 as per the claim. In this row, the value in the 'apps' column is \"258\".\n\n4. Compare the found value with the given claim: The player's number of appearances matches the claim (i.e., 258 equals 258).\n\nFinally, the JSON object containing my answer and reasoning steps will be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player with all - time rank of 53\",\n    \"Start from top row and check 'all - time rank' column\",\n    \"If 'all - time rank' is greater than or equal to 53, proceed to next step\",\n    \"Check the 'apps' column for the identified player\",\n    \"Compare the found value with the given claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"all - time rank\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"apps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
