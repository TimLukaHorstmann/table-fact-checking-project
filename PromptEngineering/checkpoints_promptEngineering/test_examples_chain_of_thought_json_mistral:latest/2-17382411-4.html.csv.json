The data doesn't explicitly mention the year, but it seems reasonable to assume that it is a single season since all games are within a 30-day range (November 1 to November 28). Without more context, we can't confirm this, but for simplicity, let's proceed assuming it's correct.\n\n2. Search for the location where the games were played. The location of the games is mentioned in the \"location attendance\" column. In this case, the games were played at the \"Seattle Center Coliseum\".\n\n3. Count the number of rows where the location is \"Seattle Center Coliseum\". We can do this by iterating through the data and checking each row's third element (column name: \"location attendance\") to see if it matches \"Seattle Center Coliseum\".\n\n   Using this approach, we find that 4 games were played at Seattle Center Coliseum (rows with indexes 1, 7, 15, and 17).\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Assume the data represents a single season, identify the location of games, count the number of times this location appears\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n     ]\n   }",
