    "resp": "Here are the steps I would take to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify the conditions in the claim:\n   - There be no industrial and commercial panel with a labor panel greater than 1\n   - A nominated by the taoiseach should be less than 11\n   - A cultural and educational panel should be smaller than 0\n\n2. Iterate through each row (i.e., each party) in the table to check if any of them meet the conditions:\n\n   - For industrial and commercial panels, check if the \"industrial and commercial panel\" is non-zero and the \"labor panel\" is greater than 1. If so, this row does not satisfy the condition. Move on to the next row.\n   - For each row, check if the \"nominated by the taoiseach\" is equal to or greater than 11. If so, this row does not satisfy the condition. Move on to the next row.\n   - For cultural and educational panels, check if the \"cultural and educational panel\" is non-positive (i.e., zero or less). If so, this row does not satisfy the condition. Move on to the next row.\n\n3. If no rows meet any of the conditions after iterating through all rows, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in a JSON object:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the conditions in the claim\",\n    \"Iterate through each row to check if any of them meet the conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"labor panel\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\" },\n    // The following rows do not need to be included in relevant cells as they do not violate any conditions\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"labor panel\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\" },\n    // ... and so on for all rows\n  ]\n}\n```",
