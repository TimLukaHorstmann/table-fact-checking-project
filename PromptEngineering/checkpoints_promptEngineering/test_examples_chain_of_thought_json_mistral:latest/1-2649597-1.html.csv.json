From the table provided, there is no direct mention of a driver named \"Shane Hall\". However, we can infer that the teams listed in the \"team (s)\" column might represent the drivers. In this case, we will examine the rows where the team name appears multiple times for a single year or across consecutive years, as it could indicate the same driver.\n\n2. Examine each row for the teams mentioned in step 1:\n   - stegell motorsports: only appears in 3 consecutive years (1995-1997), so we can rule this out as possibly being Shane Hall's team.\n   - curb - agajanian performance group: appears once in 1999, so we can rule this out as possibly being Shane Hall's team.\n   - alumni motorsports: appears only once in 2000, which is a potential match.\n   - hensley racing: appears multiple times from 2001 to 2002, but not in 2000, so we can rule this out as possibly being Shane Hall's team.\n   - jay robinson racing: appears multiple times from 2003 to 2006, but also in 2000 and 2008, which are potential matches.\n\n3. Since the year we are interested in (2000) has only one matching team (alumni motorsports), it is highly likely that Shane Hall raced for this team during this year. However, to verify the claim about \"Shane Hall dnf half of his race\", we need to check the \"dnf\" column in the row corresponding to 2000 and alumni motorsports.\n\n4. Check the \"dnf\" value for the row where the team is \"alumni motorsports\" and the year is 2000.
