    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"hwang sun partnered with kang haeng 3 times at tournaments\". We need to find out if there are at least three instances where 'kang haeng' is listed as a partner for another player, and that player's name is either not mentioned or different from 'hwang sun'.\n\n2. Check the table structure: The table has five columns (outcome, event, year, venue, partner) and multiple rows of data.\n\n3. Search the table: Look through each row to find instances where 'kang haeng' is listed as a partner.\n\n4. Find relevant data: If we find three or more such instances, then we can check if any of those instances also list 'hwang sun' as a partner for the same event (since we are considering the same tournament).\n\n5. Final answer: Based on our findings, we will provide either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the table data:\n\n- The first row indicates the column names.\n- Rows 2 and 3 both have 'kang haeng - suk' as partners, but their events are different (world championships and asian games).\n- Row 4 has 'kang haeng - suk' as a partner again, but this time for the event 'other open tournaments'.\n- Row 5 also lists 'kang haeng - suk' as a partner, this time for the same event ('wd') as row 2. However, the event in row 5 is different from the events in rows 2 and 4. Since we don't have information about the partner of 'hwang sun' for these events, we cannot definitively say whether they partnered together three times or not.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Check table structure\", \"Search the table for instances of 'kang haeng'\", \"Find relevant data\", \"Check if partners are the same for at least 3 events\"],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\" }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the claim elements: The claim states that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1985 world championship in Calgary, Canada.

Locate relevant data: In the given table, there are two rows with the partner \"Kang haeng - suk\". We will check if any of these entries match the claimed event (1985 world championship) and venue (Calgary, Canada).\n3. Compare the data: The first row for Kang Haeng-Suk has an event as \"world championships\" but does not specify the year or location. The second row has an event as \"wd\", which stands for 'withdrawal' or 'default', and the year is 1985 along with Calgary, Canada as the venue. However, this entry doesn't have a partner named Hwang Sun. The third row, though it specifies the year as 1985 and mentions \"world championships\", does not include any information about Kang Haeng-Suk or the city (just 'world championships'). The fifth row has no mention of Calgary or the world championship.\n4.

If the outcome matches \"finish second\" for any of these rows, then it's plausible that Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1985.
