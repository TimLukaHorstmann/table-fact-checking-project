Determine where in the table we can find information about the year and the name of the person (Susan Sarandon).\n3. Look for a row where the year matches 2001 and the 'winner / nominee (s)' column contains Susan Sarandon or her name appears as a nominee if 'winner' is not specified.\n\nBased on the table, the relevant cells are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\" }\n]\n\nThe row index 1 corresponds to the year 1999 and the movie \"the rugrats movie\", but Susan Sarandon was not a winner or nominee for that film. However, in row index 2, we find that Susan Sarandon was indeed a nominee (won) in the year 2001 for the movie 'rugrats in paris : the movie'.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Determine relevant columns\",\n    \"Find year and nominee/winner information\",\n    \"Compare with claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\" }\n  ]\n}",

The columns are \"year\", \"category\", \"film\", \"winner / nominee (s)\", \"result\". We need \"film\" and \"result\" to check if Bruce Willis was nominated for Rugrats Go Wild.\n\n2. Scan through the rows of data to find an entry where the \"film\" matches \"Rugrats Go Wild\".\n\n3. If a match is found, check the \"result\" value. If it's \"nominated\", then Bruce Willis was nominated for Rugrats Go Wild. If it's \"won\" or any other value, he wasn't nominated.\n\n4.
