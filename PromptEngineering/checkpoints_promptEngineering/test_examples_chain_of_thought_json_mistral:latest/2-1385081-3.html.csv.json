Inspect the \"score\" value for each match in those three rows to see if they contain a goal scored by Cho Jae-jin.\n4. Check if the total number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in these matches is 5 (sum of the scores in the relevant rows should be 5).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'score' column\",\n    \"Filter data for the year 2006\",\n    \"Check if the scores correspond to Cho Jae-jin\",\n    \"Sum the scores of the relevant rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: In the filtered data for the year 2006, the total number of goals scored is not 5.
