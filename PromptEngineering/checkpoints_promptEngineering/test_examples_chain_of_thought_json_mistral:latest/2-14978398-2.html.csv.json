So, the relevant rows are from 0 to 6, which gives us 7 rows.\n\n2. Check if there are any duplicate versions of the song within the relevant rows. To do this, we compare the \"length\" and \"album\" fields for each version since these are likely to be unique for different versions of the same song (assuming no two songs on the album have the same length and title). If we find more than one version with the same length and album, that would mean there are duplicate versions.\n\n3. After comparing all the relevant rows, if there are no duplicates, then over 2 years (from 1995 to 1996), there would be at least 7 different versions of the song.
