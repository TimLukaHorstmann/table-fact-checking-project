This will help us find the relevant row in the table. In this case, the home team is \"nuggets\".\n2. Look for a row where the 'home' column equals \"nuggets\" and the 'opponent' (which can be found by looking at the 'visitor' column) equals \"trail blazers\". This will allow us to find the specific game in which the Trail Blazers played against the Nuggets.\n3. Check the 'record' column for the row where the home team is the Nuggets and the opponent is the Trail Blazers. The record should be 6-3 if the claim is true.\n\nAfter reviewing the table, let's find the relevant cells:\n1. First row index: Find the row number of the game in which the Trail Blazers play against the Nuggets (home team). In this case, it's row 4 with a value of \"trail blazers\" in the 'visitor' column and \"nuggets\" in the 'home' column.\n2. Relevant cells: [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"}]\n\nNow let's check the record: The 'record' value for row 4 is \"6 - 3\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row number of the game in which the Trail Blazers play against the Nuggets. Check the 'record' column for this row.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"}]\n}",
