    "resp": "Here are the steps to check the claim:\n\n1. Identify the team: The team we are looking for is Patrick Racing.\n2. Filter out the rows with the required team: We need to find drivers who belong to the \"Patrick Racing\" team.\n3. Filter out the points and grid values: We are looking for drivers with less than 2 points and a grid number larger than 4.\n4. Compare the filtered drivers: If we find any driver that matches the conditions, they will be ryan hunter - reay and oriol servi\u00e0 as per the claim.\n5.
