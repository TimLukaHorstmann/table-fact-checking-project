Determine the criteria for identifying the writer of an episode: In the table, the column \"written by\" provides the information about who wrote each episode.\n3. Check each row of the data to find the episodes written by kenny smith: By examining the \"written by\" column, we can see that rows 9, 21, 29, 37, and 45 have \"kenny smith\" as the writer.\n4. Determine the episode number for each row: The column \"no in season\" provides the episode number within a season. For example, row 9 has a value of \"109\", which is the 9th episode in the season (counting from 1).\n5. Find out if any of the episodes written by kenny smith match the claim: By comparing the episode numbers where kenny smith is the writer with the number mentioned in the claim, we can see that row 9 corresponds to episode 109.\n6.
