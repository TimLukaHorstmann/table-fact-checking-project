Check if there's a row in the table where the 'home team' column matches the identified home team. In this case, the first row matches (\"fitzroy\" is in the first row under the 'home team' column).\n\n3. Identify the away team mentioned in the claim (\"south melbourne\").\n4. Check if there's a row in the table where the 'away team' column matches the identified away team. In this case, the first row also matches (\"south melbourne\" is in the second row under the 'away team' column).\n\n5. Identify the scores for both teams mentioned in the claim (12.15 for south melbourne and 11.22 for fitzroy).\n6. Check if the scores in the first row (fitzroy) are equal to or less than the scores in the second row (south melborne), which is a condition for loss. In this case, 11.22 < 12.15, so the condition holds true.\n\n7. Compare the overall score difference between both teams from the table and the score difference mentioned in the claim. In this case, the score difference between the given scores (12.15 - 11.22 = 1.38) is different from the score difference mentioned in the claim (87 - 88). However, it's important to note that the final result or score difference doesn't necessarily indicate a loss; the teams' scores at individual points during the match are what truly matter here.\n\nSince all the other conditions were met and the score difference is not crucial in determining whether fitzroy lost to south melbourne, I conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify home team in claim\", \"Find row where 'home team' matches\", \"Identify away team in claim\", \"Find row where 'away team' matches\", \"Check if scores in identified row meet the loss condition\", \"Compare overall score difference between both teams from table and the score difference mentioned in claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}]\n}",
