In this case, it seems that \"Real Valladolid\" has 49 goals, but we should confirm by checking all teams.\n4. Check if the maximum value found is greater than Real Valladolid's goal count: If the maximum value found across all rows in the \"goals for\" column is greater than 49, then it means that Real Valladolid did not score the most goals and our claim is false. Otherwise, if the maximum value is less than or equal to 49, then Real Valladolid scored the most goals, making our claim true.\n\nBased on the comparison of goal counts for all teams in the table, it can be confirmed that \"Real Valladolid\" indeed has the highest number of goals (49) compared to other teams, which makes the following JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the 'goals for' column\", \"Compare goal counts across all teams\", \"Find the team with the maximum goal count\", \"Check if Real Valladolid's goal count is less than the maximum found\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"goals for\" }\n  ]\n}",
