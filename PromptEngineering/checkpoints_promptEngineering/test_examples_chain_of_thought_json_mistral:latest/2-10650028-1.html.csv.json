Understand the context: Given the table contains data about players, their position, round of draft, overall ranking, and college they attended, I need to find out whether Raymond Irvin was the second defensive back to get drafted.\n\n3. Extract relevant data from the table: In this table, the \"player\" column refers to the player's name, the \"position\" column indicates the position of the player (in this case, we are interested in defensive backs), the \"round\" column represents the round of the draft, and \"overall\" is the overall ranking. Since the claim does not mention a specific round, I will look at all rows where the position is \"defensive back\".\n\n4. Find relevant players: By filtering the table based on the position of defensive backs (rows 1, 3, 7, and 9), I can compare Raymond Irvin's row number with the other defensive backs to determine his draft order among them.\n\n5. Compare data: In the filtered data, there are four rows representing defensive backs. By counting the number of defensive backs before Raymond Irvin (rows 1, 3, and 7), I find that two defensive backs were drafted before him. Thus, Raymond Irvin was the third defensive back to get drafted in this dataset (since he is at row 9).\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Understand context\",\n    \"Extract relevant data from table\",\n    \"Find relevant players\",\n    \"Compare data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
