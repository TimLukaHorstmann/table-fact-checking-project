    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim's components to compare them with the table data:\n   - The score should be \"5 - 4 (ot)\"\n   - The location and attendance should be \"montreal forum\"\n   - The date should be after \"may 10\"\n\n2. Iterate through each row in the table (data array) to find a match for the components:\n\n3. For the first row, compare its score with the claim's score: They are not equal, so continue to the next row.\n4. For the second row, compare its score with the claim's score: They are not equal, so continue to the next row.\n5. For the third row, compare its location/attendance with the claim's location: They do not match, so continue to the next row.\n6. For the fourth row, compare its date with \"may 10\": It is earlier, so continue to the next row.\n7. For the fifth row, compare its score with the claim's score: They are not equal, so continue to the next row.\n8. For the sixth row, compare its location/attendance with the claim's location: They match.\n9. Compare the date in the sixth row (\"may 8\") with \"may 10\": The date is earlier. Therefore, there are no rows that meet all three requirements of the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the components in the claim to compare them with the table data\",\n    \"Iterate through each row and find a match for the components\",\n    \"Compare each row's score, location/attendance, and date with the corresponding components of the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
