Define what a \"round\" means in this context: In this table, there is no explicit mention of multiple rounds. However, since all dates are the same (\"7 june 1926\"), it can be assumed that all matches listed are from the same round.\n\n3. Compare each team's score to Carlton's score (14.9 or 93 points): Start by finding Carlton's row in the table, which is the 5th row with \"carlton\" in the \"away team\" column. The score for Carlton is found in the \"away team score\" column and equals 14.9 (93 points).\n\n4. Check each team's score against Carlton's: For each match listed, compare their away team scores to Carlton's score of 14.9 (93 points). The relevant teams and their scores are:\n   - North Melbourne: home team score = 10.13 (73)\n   - Melbourne: home team score = 12.16 (88)\n   - Fitzroy: home team score = 11.15 (81)\n   - Geelong: home team score = 13.11 (89)\n   - St Kilda: home team score = 9.12 (66)\n   - Footscray: home team score = 10.11 (71)\n\n5.

The team with a higher score wins.\n2. For every row, if the home team has a higher score than the away team, then that team is considered as the winner for that game.\n3. Check if all teams listed in the claim are present among the winners.\n\nThe relevant cells for this task are:\n- Each cell containing the \"home team\" and \"away team\" scores\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare the score of each home team with their respective opponents' scores. If the home team has a higher score, they are considered winners.\",\n    \"Check if all teams listed in the claim ('north melbourne', 'south melbourne', 'fitzroy', 'essendon', 'st kilda', 'footscray') are present among the winners.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe reason for the final answer being \"FALSE\" is that not all teams listed in the claim ('north melbourne', 'south melbourne', 'fitzroy', 'essendon', 'st kilda', 'footscray') are present among the winners. For example, North Melbourne lost their game against Richmond (10.13 < 10.14) and Footscray lost to Carlton (10.11 < 14.9). The rest of the teams won their respective games.",
