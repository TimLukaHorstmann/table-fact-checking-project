    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the 1st place driver by finding the row where 'grid' column has a value of 1 (the grid position for the first place is always 1). In our table, Ayrton Senna is in the 1st place.\n\n2. Check if Alain Prost and Alain Prost's teammate at McLaren, Keke Rosberg, are in the top three positions. This is necessary because if either of them isn't in the top three, we don't need to consider their finishing times since they aren't part of our comparison. Alain Prost is indeed in the 2nd position, and based on the grid column, it seems that Keke Rosberg (driver with grid = 7) retired early due to electrical problems, so he won't be included in the comparison.\n\n3. Now we will compare the time of the 2nd place driver (Alain Prost) with the 1st place driver (Ayrton Senna). The \"time / retired\" column provides the race finishing times for each driver. We need to check if Alain Prost's time is less than or equal to Ayrton Senna's time + 1 minute (since a one-minute gap would satisfy the claim of being within a minute of the 1st place driver).\n\n4. In our table, Alain Prost's finishing time is \"+ 18.772\", which means his actual time was more than Ayrton Senna's by 18.772 seconds. This means that Alain Prost did not complete the race within a minute of Ayrton Senna.\n\n5. Similarly, we will compare the time of the 3rd place driver (nigel mansell) with the 1st place driver (Ayrton Senna). We need to check if Nigel Mansell's time is less than or equal to Ayrton Senna's time + 2 minutes (since a two-minute gap would satisfy the claim of being within two minutes of the 1st place driver, given that Alain Prost has already been shown to be outside this limit).\n\n6. In our table, Nigel Mansell's finishing time is \"1:37:21.900\", which means his actual time was 1 hour, 37 minutes and 21.900 seconds. Comparing this with Ayrton Senna's time of 1:36:XX (where XX represents the unrecorded number of seconds) shows that Nigel Mansell completed the race within a two-minute gap of Ayrton Senna, satisfying the claim.\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude that only the 3rd place driver (Nigel Mansell) completed the race within a two-minute gap of the 1st place driver (Ayrton Senna).\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the 1st place driver\",\n    \"Check if Alain Prost and Keke Rosberg are in top three positions\",\n    \"Compare the time of the 2nd place driver (Alain Prost) with the 1st place driver (Ayrton Senna)\",\n    \"Compare the time of the 3rd place driver (Nigel Mansell) with the 1st place driver (Ayrton Senna)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Loop through all rows in the \"data\" array (excluding header row).\n3. For each row, check if the constructor is Ferrari by comparing the value at the \"constructor\" column with the string 'Ferrari'.\n4. Count the number of rows where the constructor is Ferrari.\n5. Compare the count from step 4 with the claim that Ferrari was the constructor for 3 cars.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the constructor column\",\n    \"Loop through all data rows (excluding header)\",\n    \"Check if constructor is Ferrari for each row\",\n    \"Count the number of rows where constructor is Ferrari\",\n    \"Compare the count with the claim that there were 3 Ferraris\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this table, there are indeed three rows where the constructor is Ferrari:\n- nelson piquet (row index 2)\n- michele alboreto (row index 4)\n- stefan johansson (row index 5)",
