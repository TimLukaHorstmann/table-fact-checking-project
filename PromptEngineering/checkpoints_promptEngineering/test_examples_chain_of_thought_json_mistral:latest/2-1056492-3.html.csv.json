    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason through the claim:\n\n1. Understand the given table structure and the claim to be verified. The table contains data about different seasons, divisions, teams (tms), positions (pos), and the team's progress in FA cup matches (fa cup). The claim is that there is no team in any division from season 2003 through 2012 with less than 13 teams and a position less than 8.\n\n2. Scan the table data to find the years (season) mentioned in the claim, which are 2003 to 2012.\n\n3. Since the condition is related to the team count and positions, we need to focus on the columns \"tms\" (number of teams) and \"pos\" (position). For each year, check if there exists a row where the \"tms\" value is less than 13 or the \"pos\" value is less than 8.\n\n4. Perform the check for all years in the given range. If we find even one such case, then the claim is false; otherwise, it is true.\n\nNow let's check the data:\n- In the year 2003, the team count (tms) is 12, which meets the condition.\n- In the year 2004, the team count (tms) is 13, which meets the condition.\n- In the year 2005, the team count (tms) is 13, which meets the condition.\n- In the year 2006, the team count (tms) is 14, exceeding the specified number of teams. However, this does not violate the claim since it doesn't refer to any team with a position less than 8.\n- Continuing the check for all seasons in the given range, we find that no team has a count (tms) less than 13 and a position less than 8.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand the claim and table structure\", \"Scan the years mentioned in the claim\", \"Check the 'tms' column for all years to see if any team count is less than 13\", \"Check the 'pos' column for all years to see if any position is less than 8\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the seasons present in the table after 2012. The seasons are 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (no data was provided for these seasons).\n\n2. For each season after 2012, check if there is a row where the \"season\" column matches one of the identified seasons, and the \"fa cup\" column indicates reaching the round of 16 or further. In other words, we are looking for a combination of a season after 2012 and a position in the fa cup that is either \"quarter final\", \"semi final\", or \"final\".\n\n3. If such a combination exists, then the claim is false, because there would have been at least one division that reached the round of 16 after 2012. Otherwise, if no such combination exists, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's check each season:\n- For 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, there are no matching rows in the table.\n\nThe claim is therefore TRUE, as there is no division present in the table with a season after 2012 that reached the round of 16 in the FA cup.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify seasons after 2012\",\n    \"Check if any row in the table for those seasons has 'fa cup' as either 'quarter final', 'semi final', or 'final'\",\n    \"If such a combination exists, claim is false; otherwise, claim is true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

Check the column \"pos\" of the found row, which contains the position of the team in question. In this case, it's 7 according to the table.\n   4. Compare the found position with the expected position for a team that reaches the quarter-final. The claim states that the team should be in position 8 or better (quarter-finals are usually positions 1-8).\n   5.
