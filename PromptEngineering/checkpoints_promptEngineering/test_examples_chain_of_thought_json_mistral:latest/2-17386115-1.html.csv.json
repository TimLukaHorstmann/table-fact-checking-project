Understand the structure of the table: The table consists of multiple rows, each containing data about a player from a football draft. The columns are \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"school / club team\".\n\n3. Find the row related to Ken Irvin: To find this, we look for the row where the \"player\" column equals \"ken irvin\". In this case, it's the 6th row (row_index 5).\n\n4. Verify the round in which Ken Irvin was drafted: In the column \"round\", we can see that Ken Irvin's draft round is 4.\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that Ken Irvin was indeed drafted in the fourth round (round 4, pick 109).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Understand the table structure\", \"Find the row related to Ken Irvin\", \"Verify the round\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}]\n}",

Identify the player's name that we are looking for, which is \"ken irvin\".\n4. Search through the data to find a combination of the \"round\", \"player\", and \"position\" values where the round is 1 (for the first round) and the player's name is \"ken irvin\".
