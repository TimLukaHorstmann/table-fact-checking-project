    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the opponent who appears for the first time in the table. To do this, compare each \"opponent\" value with all other \"opponent\" values and find the one that does not appear in any of the previous rows. In this case, the new orleans saints are the first row where the \"opponent\" is different from all previous rows (row_index=10).\n\n2. Determine if the 11th week is the first appearance of the new orleans saints as an opponent. To do this, compare the value in the \"week\" column of the row containing the new orleans saints with other weeks in the table and find out if it's greater than or equal to 11. In this case, the value is 11 (row_index=9, since the week count starts from 1), which means that the new orleans saints first appear as an opponent during the 11th week.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare each 'opponent' value with all other 'opponent' values to find the one that does not appear in any of the previous rows.\",\n    \"Find the row index of the new orleans saints (row_index=10)\",\n    \"Compare the value in the 'week' column of this row with other weeks in the table to see if it's greater than or equal to 11.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Week 3 corresponds to rows with \"week\" equal to 3, and week 4 corresponds to rows with \"week\" equal to 4.\n\n2. Extract the attendance values for these respective weeks from the table.
