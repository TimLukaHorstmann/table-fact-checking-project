Identify both teams mentioned in the claim (red star and olympique de marseille) and find their respective rows in the table based on the team names. The row indices for red star and olympique de marseille are 2 and 3 respectively.\n\n2. Check if there is any information about the second round opponents for both teams in the given table. In this table, the second round opponent for a team is represented by the \"2nd round\" column.\n\n3. For red star (row index 2), the value in the \"2nd round\" column is blank. This indicates that there is no information about its second round opponent in the provided table.\n\n4. For olympique de marseille (row index 3), the value in the \"2nd round\" column is \"1 - 0\". Since this value is not equal to red star's team name (which was expected if they were opponents), we can conclude that they do not face each other in the second round.\n\nNow, let us format the output as per the required JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams in claim\",\n    \"Find rows for those teams based on team names\",\n    \"Check if there is information about second round opponents for both teams\",\n    \"Compare second round opponent values of both teams\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
