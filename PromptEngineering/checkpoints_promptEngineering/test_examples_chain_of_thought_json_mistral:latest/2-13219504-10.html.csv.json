Determine the criteria for ranking: Since there isn't any explicit information about the placement (first, second, etc.) in terms of runs, we have to assume that the order is based on the wicket number column. So, let's consider the wicket number as the placement.\n3. Compare the runs for each pair in the partnerships column: To find out who the second place winner is, we first need to find the pair with the third-highest wicket number (considering it as the second place). We can see that the lowest wicket numbers are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and then a gap starts. So, the pair with the fourth-highest wicket number is the one we're interested in: \"devon smith / shivnarine chanderpaul\" (row index 1).\n4. Find the runs for the second place winner: To determine if this pair has the highest runs, we look up their row and find the runs value: 95.\n5. Compare the runs of other pairs: Now, let's compare this value with the runs of all other pairs to ensure there are no higher values. We can see that none of the remaining pairs have a runs value greater than 95.\n6.
