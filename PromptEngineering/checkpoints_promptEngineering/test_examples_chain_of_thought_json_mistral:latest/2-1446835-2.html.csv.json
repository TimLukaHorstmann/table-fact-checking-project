    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the designations mentioned in the claim: \"hd 4872\" (HIP 4872) and \"hd 190360\".\n2. Find the rows in the table where the \"designation hd\" column matches the given designations. This will give us the following two rows:\n   - Row with index 5 for HIP 4872: constellation = \"cassiopeia\", date sent = \"july 6 , 2003\", arrival date = \"april 2036\", message = \"cosmic call 2\".\n   - Row with index 3 for hd 190360: constellation = \"cygnus\", date sent = \"july 1 , 1999\", arrival date = \"april 2051\", message = \"cosmic call 1\".\n3. Compare the dates of these two rows to determine if HIP 4872 was sent 4 years after hd 190360 was sent.\n   - To compare the dates, convert them into a format that can be easily compared numerically (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD). The date for HIP 4872 is '2003-07-06', and the date for hd 190360 is '1999-07-01'.\n   - Subtracting these dates, we get a difference of 4 years, 0 months, and 5 days.
