Identify the claim: The claim states that the app named \"chord finder\" was developed by Microsoft, released on 2010 - 11 - 17, and belongs to the category of utilities.\n\n2. Extract relevant data from the table: I will search for a row in the table where the title column matches \"chord finder\", the developer column matches \"microsoft\", and the category column matches \"utilities\".\n\n3. Compare the extracted data with the claim: If there exists a row that satisfies all three conditions, then the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's search for a row in the table:\n\n- Row index 4 matches the title \"chord finder\" and developer \"microsoft\". However, the category is utilities only if we consider the minor version numbers (0.1, 0.3, etc.) as part of the category. But since the claim specifically mentions the category as utilities without considering minor version numbers, this match does not fully satisfy the claim.\n\n- I cannot find another row that matches all three conditions explicitly mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Extract relevant data from the table\",\n    \"Compare the extracted data with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"developer\" }\n  ]\n}",
