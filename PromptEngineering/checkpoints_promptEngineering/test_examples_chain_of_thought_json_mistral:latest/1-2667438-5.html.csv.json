The series number (32) corresponds to the \"no in series\" column.\n2. Find the row in the table that contains the value 32 in the \"no in series\" column. In this case, it is the seventh row as it has a \"no in series\" value of 32.\n3. Extract the value from the \"original air date\" column for the selected row (7th). This value is \"december 21 , 2006\".\n4. Compare the extracted value with the given claim's date (\"december 21 , 2006\"). Since they match, we can conclude that the series did indeed originally air on December 21, 2006.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant data for series 32\", \"Find row with 'no in series' = 32\", \"Extract 'original air date' value\", \"Compare extracted value with given claim's date\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"original air date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
