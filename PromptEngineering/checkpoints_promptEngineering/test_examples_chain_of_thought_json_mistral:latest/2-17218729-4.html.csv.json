    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the criteria for the claim: The team must be Pittsburgh, the game points must be more than 24, and the attendance must be 14995.\n\n2. Iterate through the table's rows to find matches for each criterion:\n   - For the team, we check if \"home\" is not equal to 'pittsburgh'.\n   - For the points, we check if the value in the \"points\" column is greater than 24.\n   - For the attendance, we check if the value in the \"attendance\" column is equal to 14995.\n\n3. If a match is found for all three criteria, the claim is TRUE. If no match is found or any one criterion is not met, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n- Row 2 (index 1) has Pittsburgh as the visitor, points are 22 which is less than 24, and attendance is 9662 which is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 3 (index 2) has Pittsburgh as the home team, points are 22, and attendance is 14995. However, Pittsburgh is the home team, not the visitor.\n- Row 5 (index 4) has Pittsburgh as the visitor, points are 22, and attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 6 (index 5) has Pittsburgh as the home team, points are 24 but the attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 7 (index 6) has Pittsburgh as the visitor, points are 24 but the attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 8 (index 7) has Pittsburgh as the home team, points are 23, and attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 9 (index 8) has Pittsburgh as the visitor, points are 24 but the attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 10 (index 9) has Pittsburgh as the home team, points are 23, and attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 11 (index 10) has Pittsburgh as the visitor, points are 27 but the attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 12 (index 11) has Pittsburgh as the home team, points are 27, and attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 13 (index 12) has Pittsburgh as the visitor, points are 25 but the attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 14 (index 13) has Pittsburgh as the home team, points are 25, and attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 15 (index 14) has Pittsburgh as the visitor, points are 27 but the attendance is not equal to 14995.\n- Row 16 (index 15) has Pittsburgh as the home team, points are 27, and attendance is not equal to 14995.\n\nSince no row meets all three criteria, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim criteria (team, points > 24, attendance = 14995); Iterate through table rows and check for matches\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
