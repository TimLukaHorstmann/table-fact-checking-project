In this case, we are interested in the \"team classification\" and \"combativity prize\" columns.\n2. Iterate through each row of data in the table to check if Richardo Serrano appears under the \"team classification\" column.\n3. If Richardo Serrano is found under the \"team team classification\" column, we will then check if his name also appears under the \"combativity prize\" column.\n4. If both conditions are met for a specific row, it means that Richardo Serrano was from the Astana team and won the combativity prize in that stage.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns (team classification, combativity prize)\", \"Check if Richardo Serrano appears under team classification\", \"If yes, check if his name also appears under combativity prize\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team classification\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"combativity prize\"}]\n}\n\nExplanation: In the table provided, Richardo Serrano appears under the \"team classification\" column in row 1, but he is not listed under the \"combativity prize\" column for the same row.
