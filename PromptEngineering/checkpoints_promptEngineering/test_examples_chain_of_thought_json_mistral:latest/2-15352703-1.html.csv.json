    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify the column of interest, which is 'college' in this case. This column contains information about the university each player is from.\n2. Identify the row of interest, which should be the one with pick number 155 according to the claim. In the table, we find the row with the index that matches the pick number modulo the total rows (as the data is cyclic). Here, the total number of rows is 11, so the row for pick 155 will be at index `(155 - 1) % 11 = 4`.\n3. Compare the value in the 'college' column of the identified row with \"arizona university\".\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant column: college\",\n    \"Find the row index of pick number 155 by using modulo operation with total rows (11)\",\n    \"Compare the value in 'college' at identified row with 'arizona university'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the answer:\n\n1. Identify the column name that contains the data about each player's college, which is \"college\".\n2. Compare the values of the \"college\" for each row to find out which team appears last in the list (in this case, we are looking for teams with \"arizona\").\n3. Since the college names are not sorted alphabetically, we will loop through the data and keep a record of the rows where the college is \"arizona\".\n4. Check if there's more than one row with \"arizona\" as the college. If so, check their round numbers to determine who had the last draft pick among those players from Arizona.\n5. If there's only one player from Arizona, they will have the last draft pick by default.\n\nNow let's see if there's any player with \"arizona\" as their college:\n- Row 1 has a player from Fresno State, so it doesn't match our condition.\n- Row 3 has a player from Arizona, so it matches our condition.\n- There are no more rows with \"arizona\" in the \"college\" column.\n\nSince there is only one row with a player from Arizona, they will have the last draft pick by default.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify college column\", \"Find rows with 'arizona' as college\", \"Check for multiple players from Arizona\", \"Compare their round numbers if necessary\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
