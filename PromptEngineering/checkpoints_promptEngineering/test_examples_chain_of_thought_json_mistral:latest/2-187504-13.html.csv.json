Next, I will compare these values to determine if Italy won 2 more gold medals than Canada. Since Italy has 2 and Canada has 0, this condition is satisfied.\n\n3. Now, I will look for rows where the gold medal count matches Italy's count (which is 2) to check if Italy ties with any other nations. In this table, there are three such instances: united states (row index 9), west germany (row index 8), and Italy itself (row index 10).\n\n4. Since the claim mentions Italy ties with both the United States and West Germany, I will check if these two nations also have the same number of silver or bronze medals as Italy to ensure they are truly tied overall. However, upon checking, neither the United States nor West Germany has the same silver or bronze medal count as Italy (United States: 1 silver, 3 bronze; West Germany: 4 silver, 2 bronze).\n\n5.
