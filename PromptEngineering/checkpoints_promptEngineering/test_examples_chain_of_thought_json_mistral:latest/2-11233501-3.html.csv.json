In this case, the relevant row indices are 3 and 4 since they correspond to Serbia. The total number of years played is 7 (from the fourth row) + 0 (from the third row because the year range ends in 2006). This gives us a total of 7 years for Serbia after 2006.\n3. Identify the total number of years played overall from the table. This can be found by summing up the \"years played\" column for all rows excluding the last one, since it represents the overall total.\n4. In this case, the relevant row indices are 1, 2 and 3 (excluding the fifth row). The total number of years played is 19 (from the first row) + 9 (from the second row) + 3 (from the third row). This gives us a total of 31 years before 2007.\n5. Compare the two totals to determine whether Serbia has 31 fewer years played than the overall total. In this case, the overall total is 31 years before 2007 and Serbia has played for 7 years after 2006.
