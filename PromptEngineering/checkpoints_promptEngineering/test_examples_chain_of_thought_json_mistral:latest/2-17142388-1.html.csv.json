Loop through each row of data in the table to compare the conditions:\n   - For rows where area equals westpac, check if from equals either 7 june 1962 or 1 august 1963\n   - For rows where area equals vietnam war with tail code np - 3xx, check if from equals 18 july 1968\n3. Since the first five rows have area = westpac and the last row has area = vietnam war, compare those specific rows:\n   - For row index 0, area = westpac and from = 7 june 1962 which matches the condition\n   - For row index 5, area = vietnam war, tail code does not equal np - 3xx and from is not 18 july 1968 so this doesn't match the condition\n4.
