Identify the table structure: The table contains a set of rows (data) with five columns (track, recorded, original issue, song title, time).\n2. Find the relevant row for track 9: In this case, we look for the row where \"track\" equals 9.\n3. Check the value of the 'song title' column in the relevant row: The 'song title' column contains the names of the songs for each track.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, here is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table structure\",\n    \"Find the relevant row for track 9\",\n    \"Check the value of the 'song title' column in the relevant row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"song title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Check the structure of the table (json). We can see that it has two main sections: columns and data, and each row in the data section contains information about a track with column names like track, recorded, original issue, song title, and time.\n\n   2. Examine the claim: \"track 23 have a title : just a little bit\". To verify this, we need to find the corresponding row where the value of the 'track' column is 23 and compare it with the 'song title' column for that row.\n\n   3. Iterate through each row in the data section starting from the first row (row_index = 0) up to but not including the last row. For each row, check if the value of the 'track' column matches the target track number (23). If it does, compare the 'song title' with \"just a little bit\".\n\n   4. If we find a match between the 'track' and the target track number (23) and the 'song title' is indeed \"just a little bit\", then the claim is true. Otherwise, if no such match is found or the 'song title' does not equal \"just a little bit\", the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check the structure of the table (json) and understand its format.\",\n    \"Examine the claim to identify which track we are looking for and the expected title.\",\n    \"Iterate through each row in the data section, comparing the 'track' column with the target number (23).\",\n    \"If a match is found, compare the 'song title' column with the expected title ('just a little bit').\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"track\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"song title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
