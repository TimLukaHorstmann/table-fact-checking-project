    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the claim:\n   1. Identify the eventual winner by finding the player with the lowest total score at the end of the tournament, which is \"jim simons (a)\" since his score is 207, the lowest in the table.\n   2. To determine if three players scored better on the first round, we need to compare their scores on row 1 (the first round) with that of the eventual winner on row 1.\n   3. The first player's score on the first round is found by parsing his \"score\" column value: `71 + 71 + 65 = 207`. No errors are given, so we can assume this value correctly represents the sum of the three rounds for player 1 (Jim Simons).\n   4. Since Jim Simons' score on the first round is 207, we compare it with his own score from the table to confirm that he didn't score better in the first round than himself, which is true as both scores match. Therefore, we will ignore player 1 when checking if other players scored better on the first round.\n   5. Now, let's check the remaining players' scores on row 1 (the first round). We find their individual scores by parsing their \"score\" column values in the table.\n   6. After comparing their scores with that of Jim Simons (207), we can see that several players have lower scores on the first round, such as Jack Nicklaus (209) and Bobby Nichols (210).\n   7.

If the result is negative for a golfer, that golfer scored under par on at least one round.\n\n4. Find the count of golfers who scored under par: Count the number of golfers that scored under par by identifying how many times the condition in step 3 returns a negative number.\n\n5. Check if more than 3 distinct golfers scored under par: If the count of golfers who scored under par is greater than 3, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Understand the claim\",\n    \"Step 2: Identify the condition for scoring under par (score < 3 * par)\",\n    \"Step 3: Check each row (convert total score to int and compare with subtracted par)\",\n    \"Step 4: Find the count of golfers who scored under par\",\n    \"Step 5: Check if more than 3 distinct golfers scored under par\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
