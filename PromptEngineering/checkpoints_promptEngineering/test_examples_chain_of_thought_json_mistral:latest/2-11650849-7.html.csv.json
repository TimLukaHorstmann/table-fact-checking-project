    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the key information in the claim: It states that on Sunday, September 30, the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers 31 - 20.\n\n2. Examine the table columns to find a match for the date and teams involved: The table has columns \"year\", \"date\", \"winner\", \"result\", \"loser\".\n\n3. Scan through the data rows to find a match: The data rows contain the corresponding values for each column, such as the year, date, winner, result, loser, attendance, and location.\n\n4. Check if there exists a row where the \"date\" is Sunday, September 30, and both \"winner\" is Chicago Bears and \"loser\" is Green Bay Packers: The relevant rows are [2] and [18]. Both rows meet the condition of having Chicago Bears as the winner and Green Bay Packers as the loser.\n\n5. Check if the result (score) in the relevant rows matches the claim score: Row 2 has the score \"31 - 20\" for the Chicago Bears, while row 18 has the score \"21 - 14\". Since the score provided in the claim does not match either of these scores, it indicates that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify key information in the claim\", \"Examine table columns for relevant data\", \"Scan through data rows to find a match\", \"Check if there exists a row with specified date and teams\", \"Compare score from the found rows to the claim score\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"loser\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"loser\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
