Since the table doesn't provide any information about athletes or competitors, we cannot verify if it refers to our subject Giorgio Zampori.\n2. Check for the events where a competitor finished 1st. In this table, the \"position\" column indicates the position of each competitor in each event. We see that some competitors (rows) have a 1st place finish (position: \"1st\").\n3. Find out how many times a competitor has finished 1st in total. By counting all the rows with a position of \"1st\", we can determine the number of first-place finishes. In this table, there are 4 such rows (in years 1911 and 1913 at the Paris world championships for parallel bars, pommel horse, and rings).\n4.
