Look for rows where the title matches \"spy v spy\". This will help us find the relevant data related to this specific game.\n3. Check the genre column of the found row to determine if it matches the arcade genre, as specified in the claim.\n4. Check if there is any mention of Amstrad CPC in the table. If it is mentioned for \"spy v spy\", then we have a match with the specified system in the claim.\n5. Based on steps 3 and 4, determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\nAfter checking the table:\n- The relevant row index for \"spy v spy\" is 12 (index starts from 0).\n- The genre of \"spy v spy\" is arcade (row 12, column \"genre\").\n- Amstrad CPC is listed in the system (or platform) for \"spy v spy\" (row 12, column \"others\").\n\nTherefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Find row of claim's title\",\n    \"Check genre of found row\",\n    \"Check if Amstrad CPC is listed for the claim's title\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"genre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"others\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if the found row contains a column for 'genre' and verify that it matches 'arcade': This will help us determine whether the claim about genre is true or false.\n\n5. If the row contains a column for 'format' and the value matches 'dragon 32', then the overall claim is validated as true. Otherwise, if either the genre does not match 'arcade' or there is no 'dragon 32' in the format column, the claim will be false.\n\nFollowing these steps, let us check the table for \"spy v spy\":\n\nIn row 10 of the data array, we find the game \"spy vs spy\".
