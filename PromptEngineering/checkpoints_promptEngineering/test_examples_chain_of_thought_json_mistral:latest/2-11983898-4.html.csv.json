Iterate through each row of the data and compare them to the given claim:\n   - For the first row, the opponent in the final is not Tommy Robredo, so we can rule it out.\n   - For the second row, the date does not match July 28, 2013, so we can rule it out.\n   - For the third row, neither the outcome nor the date matches our claim, so we can rule it out.\n   - For the fourth row, the opponent in the final is not Tommy Robredo, so we can rule it out.\n   - For the fifth row, both the outcome (runner-up) and the date (July 28, 2013) match our claim. However, the opponent in this specific row is not Tommy Robredo but Gilles Simon.\n\nSince only one row was found that partially matches our claim but with an incorrect opponent, it means that the claim \"tommy robredo be the opponent on the july 28 , 2013 final\" is FALSE.\n\nNow, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the relevant columns (outcome, date, and opponent in the final),\", \"Iterate through each row of data and compare to the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
