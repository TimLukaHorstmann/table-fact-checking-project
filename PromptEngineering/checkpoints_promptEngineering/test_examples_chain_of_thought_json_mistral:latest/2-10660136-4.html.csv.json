    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify how many drivers have 'points' equal to 0 in the table. This will give us a count of drivers who didn't score any points during the race.\n2. To do this, iterate through each row in the \"data\" array, and for each row, check if the value in the 'points' column is equal to 0. If it is, increment a counter variable.\n3. After all rows have been processed, check the value of the counter variable. If the count matches or exceeds 20, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let us verify the claim using the table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check for drivers with points equal to 0 in the 'points' column.\",\n    \"Iterate through each row and check if the value in the 'points' column is equal to 0.\",\n    \"If yes, increment a counter variable.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    ...\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe table data shows that there are indeed 20 drivers who did not score any points during the race. The relevant cells to check for this claim are all cells with a 'points' column value of 0.",
