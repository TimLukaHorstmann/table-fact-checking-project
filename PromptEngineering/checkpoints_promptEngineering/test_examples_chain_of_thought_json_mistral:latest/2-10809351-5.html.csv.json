    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the teams mentioned in the claim (north melbourne, footscray).\n2. For each team, find the corresponding away team score in the table.\n3. Add the scores together to get a combined total away team score for north melbourne and footscray.\n4. Compare the calculated combined total with the given value (12.26).\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the teams mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"For each team, find the corresponding away team score\",\n    \"Add the scores together to get a combined total away team score\",\n    \"Compare the calculated combined total with the given value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1. The teams mentioned in the claim are north melbourne and footscray.\n2. In the table, north melbourne's away team score is 6.12 (found in row 0), and footscray's away team score is 5.14 (not found in this provided table; it should be 6.14 since there seems to be a mistake in the data for Footscray's match).\n3. Adding the scores together gives us 6.12 + 6.14 = 12.26, which is the same as the given value. However, due to the error in the provided table, we should correct it first before checking our answer.\n4. If we correct the Footscray score (row 5) to be 6.14 instead of 5.14, then the calculated combined total will be correct and match the given value. Therefore, the final output is FALSE with the relevant cells pointing to north melbourne's away team score and footscray's incorrect away team score (since there's an error in the provided table).",

    "claim": "the game at lake oval be the game with the second smallest crowd",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the games played on May 14, 1949. In this table, there are 6 rows of data, and they all list the date as \"14 may 1949\". So all games in the table are relevant to this claim.\n\n2. Next, we compare the crowd sizes for each game to determine which one has the second smallest crowd size. We can do this by sorting the crowd column values from smallest to largest.\n\n3. The sorted values are: 7500 (row 5), 11000 (row 4), 19000 (row 2), 21000 (row 3), 33000 (row 1), and 15500 (row 0).\n\n4. Looking at these sorted values, we can see that the first game has a smaller crowd size than the second smallest (the fifth game). Since the claim asks for the second smallest, the game with the second smallest crowd must be different from the first game in our table (as it has a larger crowd size).\n\n5. Comparing the remaining rows, we find that the third row (essendon vs richmond) has a smaller crowd than the fifth row (hawthorn vs fitzroy), but it is not the second smallest as claimed. So, the second smallest crowd must be either in the second or fourth row of the table.\n\n6. Lastly, we compare the crowds for these two remaining rows: 19000 (second row) and 11000 (fourth row). The second row has a smaller crowd size than the fourth row, so the game at lake oval (fourth row) is not the game with the second smallest crowd.\n\nThe final answer, based on this reasoning, is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all games played on May 14, 1949\",\n    \"Sort crowd sizes from smallest to largest\",\n    \"Find the second smallest crowd size and identify the corresponding game (based on position in sorted list)\",\n    \"Compare the crowds for each row to confirm that the game at lake oval is not the one with the second smallest crowd\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
