Check the score of the match, which is represented in the \"score in the final\" column of the corresponding row. The score provided is a series of numbers separated by commas, each pair represents a set won with the first number indicating the number of games won in that set and the second number being the number of games lost.\n4. Analyze the given score to determine if Carlos Kirmayr won more than one set against Jos\u00e9 Higueras. In this case, the score is \"5 - 7, 6 - 3, 1 - 6\". This means that Carlos Kirmayr won the first set with a score of 5 games to 7 games (loss), the second set with a score of 6 games to 3 games, and the third set with a score of 1 game to 6 games (loss).
