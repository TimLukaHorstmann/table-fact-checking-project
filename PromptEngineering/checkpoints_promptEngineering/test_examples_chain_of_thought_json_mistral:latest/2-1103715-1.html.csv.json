Determine if the time is just under 3 hours: The time is given in minutes, and we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, just under 3 hours would be a time of approximately 180 minutes (since 3 * 60 = 180). We compare the extracted time value with this approximate value to see if it's less than or equal to 180 minutes.\n\n5. Compare the times: If the extracted time is less than or equal to 180 minutes, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's check the table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: Game 4 has the shortest time of just under 3 hours on October 23\",\n    \"Find row for game 4\",\n    \"Extract time of game 4\",\n    \"Determine if time is 'just under' 3 hours (180 minutes)\",\n    \"Compare times\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this table, the data for game 4 is in the row with index 3.
