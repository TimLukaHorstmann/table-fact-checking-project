Next, we will iterate through each row in the data array and compare the value at index 'laps' for each driver.\n3. If a driver has the maximum number of laps, then that driver will have the highest number of laps.\n4. In the case where multiple drivers have the same maximum number of laps, we cannot definitively say who has the highest number of laps without additional information (e.g., time or position on grid).
