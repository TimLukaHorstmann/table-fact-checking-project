However, we can calculate the aggregates from the given data.\n\n2. Calculate the aggregate scores for each team: Since the table shows the score for each leg, we can add the scores from both legs to find the total aggregate score for each team. For example, for the first row (sloga jugomagnat), the 1st leg score is 2 and the 2nd leg score is 1, so the aggregate score is 3.\n\n3. Check if any team has a tied aggregate: After calculating the aggregates, we look for any pairs of teams where their aggregate scores are equal. In our table, we find two such pairs with tied aggregates:\n   - sloga jugomagnat (aggregate: 3) and pelister (aggregate: 5), since pelister has an aggregate score that is the sum of a home advantage (+2 goals in this league) and their actual score (3-5 becomes 1 when we remove the home advantage).\n   - rabotni\u010dki (aggregate: 4, considering the penalty shootout result) and karaorman (aggregate: 4), since both teams have equal aggregate scores without the consideration of penalties.\n\n4.

Determine if the remaining matches (excluding the team with a tie) are losses by checking if the scores of either team is greater than 1. If any of the remaining rows do not meet this condition, then they are not losses.\n\nNow let's find the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of unique teams in the 'data' array (excluding the first row with column names).\",\n    \"Filter out rows that have a non-empty value in the '1st leg' column.\",\n    \"For each remaining row, check if the score of both teams is equal to 1 and record it as a tie. If the score of either team is greater than 1, record it as a loss.\",\n    \"Check how many rows have a score of 1 (excluding ties) and count the number of losses.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\" }\n  ]\n}",
