    "resp": "1. Identify the driver whose constructor is Ferrari from the data: The driver who has \"ferrari\" under the \"constructor\" column. In this case, Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello are both drivers for Ferrari.\n\n2. Narrow down to a single driver: Since we are looking for an average grid number of 1 and time / retire of \"1:32:35.101\", we need to find a row that matches these conditions for Michael Schumacher, as he is the one with the desired time / retire.\n\n3. Check the grid column for this driver: Grid numbers represent starting positions, and an average grid number of 1 implies that this driver started from position 1 in at least one race. We can see that Michael Schumacher started from position 1 in this specific race (grid = 1).\n\n4. Verify if the time / retire matches for this driver: We need to ensure that the time / retire for this driver is \"1:32:35.101\". In the provided data, Michael Schumacher indeed has a time of \"1:32:35.101\" under the \"time / retired\" column.\n\n5. Combine the information from steps 2-4 to check if the claim is true: We have verified that Michael Schumacher (a driver for Ferrari) started from position 1 in at least one race and has a time / retire of \"1:32:35.101\" for this specific race. This satisfies the conditions stated in the claim, making it TRUE.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the driver whose constructor is Ferrari\",\n    \"Narrow down to a single driver (Michael Schumacher)\",\n    \"Check the grid column for this driver (grid = 1)\",\n    \"Verify if the time / retire matches for this driver (time / retired = '1:32:35.101')\",\n    \"Combine the information to check if the claim is true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"grid\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
