To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to understand what \"low\" and \"unusually high\" mean in this context. For the sake of argument, let's assume that \"low\" means lower than average for the dataset and \"unusually high\" means significantly higher than average.\n3. To check if the median household income is lower than average, we need to compare it with other median household incomes in the dataset.\n4. Similarly, to see if the median family income is unusually high, we should compare it with other median family incomes in the dataset.\n5. To find these averages, we would calculate either the mean or median of all household and family income values in the dataset respectively.\n6. After calculating the average values for both household and family income, we can compare Harding County's values to these averages.
