Identify the key elements of the claim: \"2 round match\", \"hold in south dakota, united states\" and \"the opponent's name be brian dunn\".\n\n2. Find all rows in the table that have \"round\" equal to 2 and \"location\" containing \"south dakota, united states\". This will help us narrow down our search.\n\n3. From the reduced set of rows, find the row where the value for \"opponent\" is \"brian dunn\".\n\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Brian Dunn was the opponent of a match that took place in South Dakota, United States with 3 rounds.\n\n2. Find matches with three rounds: Filter the data array to only include rows where round = 3. This will help us find matches with 3 rounds.\n\n3. Filter for matches in South Dakota: Further filter the resulting array from step 2 to only include rows where location contains \"South Dakota\". This will help us find matches that took place in South Dakota, United States.\n\n4. Identify opponents: From the filtered data, we can identify the opponents of these matches by looking at the opponent column.\n\n5. Check for Brian Dunn: Once we have identified the opponents from step 4, we can check if one of them is Brian Dunn.\n\n   Here's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find matches with three rounds\",\n    \"Filter for matches in South Dakota\",\n    \"Identify opponents\",\n    \"Check for Brian Dunn\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\" }\n  ]\n}",
