If the found weapon matches either \"shortsword\" or \"two shortswords\", proceed to the next step.\n6. Check the value in the \"shield animal\" column of that row for the shield animal.\n7. Compare the found shield animal with \"falcon\" (from the claim).\n8. If they match, the claim is TRUE.\n9. If at any point the conditions are not met, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify knight in question\",\n    \"Find row of identified knight\",\n    \"Check weapon / item column for external weapons\",\n    \"Compare found weapon with 'two shortswords' or 'shortsword'\",\n    \"Check shield animal column for shield animal\",\n    \"Compare found shield animal with 'falcon'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"knight\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"weapon / item\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"shield animal\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
