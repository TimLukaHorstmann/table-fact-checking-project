    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The claim states that in 1914, James A Gallivan (d) was re-elected and ran unopposed.\n2. Determine the data column for \"first elected\" to find when each incumbent was first elected.\n3. Check if there is any row in the table where the \"incumbent\" matches \"James A Gallivan (d)\" and the \"first elected\" year matches 1914. This will help us determine if James A Gallivan (d) was a candidate in 1914.\n4. Since the claim states that he was re-elected, we also need to check if there is any row where the \"incumbent\" again matches \"James A Gallivan (d)\" but the \"first elected\" year is earlier than 1914. This will help us determine if James A Gallivan (d) was a candidate in a previous election.\n5. If we find a row meeting both conditions (1914 as the first elected year and an earlier year as the first elected year), then we can verify that the claim is true.\n6. If no such row is found, we will conclude that the claim is false.\n\nBased on the table provided:\n- We find a row with \"James A Gallivan (d)\" as the incumbent and 1914 as the first elected year, which indicates he was a candidate in 1914.\n- We also find a row with \"James A Gallivan (d)\" as the incumbent, but the \"first elected\" year is earlier than 1914 (1914 as the row index), indicating that he was a candidate in a previous election.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Determine data columns for incumbent, first elected and candidates\",\n    \"Check if 'James A Gallivan (d)' was a candidate in 1914\",\n    \"If 'James A Gallivan (d)' was a candidate in a previous election\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"first elected\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"candidates\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
