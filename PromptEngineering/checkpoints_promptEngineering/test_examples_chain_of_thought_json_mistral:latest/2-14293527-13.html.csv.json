Next, I'll iterate through each row in the data to find the rows where the team column is \"Estevan Bruins\".\n3. Then, for those rows, I'll check if the position column value is \"defense\".

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns: The claim involves the player's position (right wing) and nationality (Canada). So, we will focus on these two columns.\n2. Check the data for the first row: In the first row of the table, Larry Wright is listed as a center, which does not match his claimed position as a right wing. However, we should still verify his nationality since that part of the claim is correct.\n3. Check the nationality: Nationalities are provided in the fourth column for each player. Larry Wright's nationality is Canada, which matches the claim.\n4. Reconcile the findings: Since the table provides conflicting information about Larry Wright's position (center vs. right wing), we cannot definitively say that he is a right wing from Canada based on this table alone. However, we can confirm that he is from Canada.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns: Position and Nationality.
