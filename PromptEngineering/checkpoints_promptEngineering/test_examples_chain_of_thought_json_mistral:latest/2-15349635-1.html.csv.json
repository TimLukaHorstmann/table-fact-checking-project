In this case, the first team is at position 1 (row index 0) and the second team is at position 2 (row index 1).\n2.

To check if the teams are separated by a 2-goal difference, we need to look at the 'difference' column. In the given data, neither Flamengo nor Fluminense have a value in the 'difference' column that could be interpreted as a 2-goal difference (8 and 10 are not 2 goals apart). Therefore, I cannot confirm whether they are separated by a 2-goal difference at this stage.\n4. To proceed further, it would require more context or data about what is meant by a \"2-goal difference\" in the context of the table provided.
