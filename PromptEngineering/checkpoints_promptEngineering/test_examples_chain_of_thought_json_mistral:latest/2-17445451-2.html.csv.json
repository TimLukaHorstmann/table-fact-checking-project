Examine the table structure: The table contains a list of columns (res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time) and data rows containing information about fights.\n3. Look for rows where the opponent matches with Cleber Luciano: We will compare each row's \"opponent\" column to Cleber Luciano.\n4. Find the relevant row(s): In the data array, look for a row where the value of the \"opponent\" column equals \"Cleber Luciano.\"\n5. Examine the time information: Once we find the relevant row, verify that the time value is greater than or equal to 7 minutes and 57 seconds.\n6. Determine the final answer: If a match with Cleber Luciano has a time value of at least 7 minutes and 57 seconds, then our claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify key elements in the claim\", \"Examine table structure\", \"Look for rows where opponent matches with Cleber Luciano\", \"Find the relevant row(s)\", \"Examine the time information\", \"Determine the final answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"}]\n}",

Find the condition for identifying the round and event: Look for rows where the \"event\" is \"UFC 20\".\n\n3. Find the condition for identifying the method: Look for rows where the \"method\" is \"TKO (cut)\". And also check that the \"round\" column matches 1 since the claim specifies round 1.\n\n4.
