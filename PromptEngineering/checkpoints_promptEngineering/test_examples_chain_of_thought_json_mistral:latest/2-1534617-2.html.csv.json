    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the events (entities) we are interested in, which are \"autumn gold\" and \"players'\".\n2. Determine the year we are interested in, which is 2007 - 08.\n3. Locate the rows in the data array that correspond to these events by finding their positions in the first column of the data array (event). For \"autumn gold\", it can be found at row index 0 and for \"players'\", at row index 4.\n4. Extract the values from the 2007 - 08 column in those rows. For \"autumn gold\", it is found in the second column (index 1) of row 0, which has a value of \"q\". For \"players'\", it is found in the third column (index 2) of row 4, which also has a value of \"q\".\n5. Compare the extracted values to confirm if they match the given results (\"c\" for autumn gold and \"q\" for players').\n6. Based on the comparison, determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. In this case, both values are equal to \"q\", so the claim is TRUE.\n\nOutput in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the events (entities) we are interested in: autumn gold and players'\",\n    \"Determine the year we are interested in: 2007 - 08\",\n    \"Locate the rows in the data array that correspond to these events\",\n    \"Extract the values from the 2007 - 08 column in those rows\",\n    \"Compare the extracted values to confirm if they match the given results\",\n    \"Determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2007 - 08\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007 - 08\" }\n  ]\n}",
