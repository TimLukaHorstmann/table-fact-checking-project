    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the table structure to understand which columns contain the information we need. In this case, we are interested in the 'name', 'best' (for best score), and 'maiden' (for number of maidens). We also need to consider the 'row_index' for each player to find Brett Lee specifically.\n2. Find the row of Brett Lee in the table by looking at the 'name' column. In this case, the row index is 4 because Brett Lee's name appears at the 5th row with 'brett lee' as its value.\n3. Check the values for the best score and number of maidens in the same row where we found Brett Lee. In this table, the 'best' and 'maiden' columns are at indices 6 and 7 respectively. Therefore, we look at the values at these indices for the row index 4 to find Brett Lee's best score (which should be \"5 / 30\") and number of maidens (which should be \"547\").\n4. Compare the claim with the actual values found from the table. The claim states that Brett Lee has a best score of \"5 / 30\" and 547 maidens in 2755.1 overs. Our findings show that the 'best' value for Brett Lee is indeed \"5 / 30\", and the 'maiden' value is 547. The number of overs (column 'overs') for Brett Lee is 2755.1, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the claim.
