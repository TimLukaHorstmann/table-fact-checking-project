Compare scores: Iterate through each row in the data array and extract the away team score for each match.\n\n4. Find the minimum score: The away team score of Melbourne (10.13 or 73) was greater than Footscray's score (7.9). All other away team scores are also greater than 7.9.\n\n5. Compare the claim with the results: The lowest score among all teams on 25 June 1927 is Footscray, which matches the claim.
