In this table, rows with an index of 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, and 18 have Boston Garden as their location.\n2. Count how many games are in that subset: There are 10 games played at Boston Garden (0 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 = 10)\n3. Compare the counted number with half of the total games for the season: Since a typical NBA season has 82 games, less than half would be 41 games or fewer (10 is less than 41, so this condition holds true).\n\nFinally, let's output the JSON object with our reasoning and answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find all rows where location equals 'boston garden'.\",\n    \"Count those rows to get the number of games at Boston Garden.\",\n    \"Compare that count to half of the total season games (82).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is the Chicago Bulls. We can find it by searching through the table's data column for the row where the opponent column contains \"chicago bulls\".\n2. Check if this team played in Boston Garden. If they did, then we need to find out if they won or lost in that game.\n3. To find out the result of their game, we will look at the score column in the row where the opponent column is \"chicago bulls\". A win would be a score with more points in the team's favor, so we are looking for an entry in the score column that contains a '-' followed by a larger number than the number before the '-'.\n4. If we find such an entry, it means that the Chicago Bulls played in Boston Garden and won. To determine if they are the only team to play in Boston Garden and win, we would need to check all other teams' records at Boston Garden. However, since no other team is guaranteed to have a win at Boston Garden (as of now), if we find that the Chicago Bulls won in Boston Garden, it implies that they are the only team to play in Boston Garden and win.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Find the row where opponent column contains 'chicago bulls'.\",\n    \"Step 2: Check if this team played in Boston Garden by looking at the location column in the same row.\",\n    \"Step 3: If they did play in Boston Garden, find out the result of their game by looking at the score column.\",\n    \"Step 4: If we find a win for the Chicago Bulls, check if any other team has also won in Boston Garden.
