The claim doesn't specify the exact match, but we are looking for the row where the 'home team' is 'Hawthorn'.\n\n2. Scan through the table data: We can see that each row represents a different match and the first column indicates the home team for that match.\n\n3. Find the relevant row: Since we are looking for the match where Hawthorn was the home team, we need to find the row where 'home team' is equal to 'Hawthorn'. In this case, the third row represents the match where Hawthorn was the home team (mcg, 31 july 1954).\n\n4. Check the claim: Now that we have identified the relevant row, we can check if the away team's score at this match is indeed 9.11 (65). In this case, the score in the 'away team score' column for the third row is \"5.3 (33)\", which does not equal 9.11 (65).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim: find the away team's score when Hawthorn was the home team\", \"Scan through the table data to find relevant row\", \"Find the relevant row where 'home team' is equal to 'Hawthorn'\", \"Check if away team's score at this match equals 9.11 (65)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}]\n}",
