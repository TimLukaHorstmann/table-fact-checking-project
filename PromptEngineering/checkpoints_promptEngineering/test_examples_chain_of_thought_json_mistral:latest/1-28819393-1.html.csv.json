In this case, we need to find the ratio of each candidate's votes to the total votes and then take the average of those ratios.\n3. Iterate through each row in the \"data\" array. For each row, calculate the ratio of the candidate's vote count (in the \"total votes\" column) to the sum of all vote counts in that row (found by adding up the values in the \"candidates\" column).
