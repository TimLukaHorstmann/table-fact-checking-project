Loop through each row (race) in the data. For each row:\n   1. Check if the value under \"poles\" column is 1 (the number of poles needed for the claim).\n   2. If step 2.1 returns true, then check if there's a corresponding value under the \"starts\" column with a value of exactly 4 (the number of starts required for the position of 46th in this dataset, given that it seems to sort by the number of starts).\n   3. If step 2.2 returns true, then check if there's a corresponding value under the \"position\" column with a value of exactly 46 (since we already verified the correct number of starts for this position).\n   4. If all three conditions in steps 2.1-2.3 are met, then we have found a row that fulfills the claim; store the relevant cell information as an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n   5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the condition given in the claim: A start of 4 and a position of 46 implies that the pole should be 0.\n2. Examine the table structure to understand the meaning of each column. We are interested in the \"starts\", \"position\", and \"poles\" columns since they relate to the given condition.\n3. Start iterating through the data array row by row.\n4. For each row, compare the value in the \"starts\" column with 4 and the value in the \"position\" column with 46. If both conditions are met for a specific row, then proceed to check the value of the \"poles\" column for that row.\n5. If the row satisfies both conditions (starts = 4 and position = 46), and the \"poles\" column has a value of 0, then the claim is true for that row. Otherwise, if either of the conditions is not met or the pole value is not 0, move on to the next row.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until we have checked every row in the data array.\n7. If the claim has been found to be true for at least one row, output a JSON object with the given format, marking the relevant cells for that specific row. If the claim is not true for any row, return false and no relevant cells.\n\nThe relevant_cells list will only include the index of the row where the condition is met (if applicable), since we're only concerned about verifying whether there exists a row that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim conditions: starts = 4 and position = 46, pole should be 0\",\n    \"Iterate through each row in the data array\",\n    \"For each row, compare the values for starts, position, and poles\",\n    \"If a row satisfies both conditions (starts = 4 and position = 46) with pole = 0, mark as true and relevant cells\",\n    \"Repeat until all rows are checked\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nSince the claim is not found to be true for any row in the given data, we return false with an empty relevant_cells list.",
