Compare the initially requested amount with the final investment amount, if there's a discrepancy and it matches the given date and episode number, then the claim is true; otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n- row_index: 6, column_name: \"company or product name\"\n- row_index: 6, column_name: \"money requested\"\n- row_index: 6, column_name: \"investing dragon (s)\"\n\nFinally, here's the output in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: episode, first aired, entrepreneur(s), company or product name, money requested, investing dragon(s)\",\n    \"Find row for 'nuts poker league': row_index = 6\",\n    \"Check the 'money requested' value\",\n    \"Check if dragons invested in this episode: row_index = 6, column_name = 'investing dragon(s)' \",\n    \"Compare the initially requested amount with the final investment amount\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"money requested\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon(s)\" }\n  ]\n}",
