Since the claim states that West Germany does not have anyone who won a medal (gold, silver or bronze), we can verify this by checking whether any competitor from West Germany has an 'sp + fs' value equal to 1 (indicating a gold medal) or 2 (indicating a silver medal) or 3 (indicating a bronze medal).\n6.
