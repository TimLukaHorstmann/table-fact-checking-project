For each of these rows, check the second leg column to see if it contains an April 2011 date. In row 10 (quarter-finals), the second leg is \"5 - 6 april 2011\", so there is a match in April 2011. In row 11 (semi-finals), the second leg is \"26 - 27 april 2011\". So, for both quarter-finals and semi-finals, there are legs in April 2011.\n\n3. Since we found matches for both quarter-finals and semi-finals in April 2011, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows corresponding to quarter-finals and semi-finals\",\n    \"Check if any of these rows have a second leg date in April 2011\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"second leg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"second leg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
