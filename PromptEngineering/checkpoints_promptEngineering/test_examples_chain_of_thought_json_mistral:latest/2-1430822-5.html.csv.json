Verify if the third place finisher in the given row matches Lucas di Grassi: In this specific row, the third-place finisher is given as \"bruno senna ( isport international )\".\n4. Compare Lucas di Grassi and Bruno Senna to determine if they are the same person: Given that both drivers raced in F1 at around the same time, it's possible they could be mistaken for each other. However, a quick web search confirms that Lucas di Grassi and Bruno Senna are different individuals.\n5. Evaluate whether Lucas di Grassi is the third-place finisher: Since Lucas di Grassi is not the same person as Bruno Senna (the third place finisher in 2008), he did not finish in third place in that year.\n\nanswer: \"FALSE\"\nrelevant_cells: [ { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"third\" }, { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\" } ]",
