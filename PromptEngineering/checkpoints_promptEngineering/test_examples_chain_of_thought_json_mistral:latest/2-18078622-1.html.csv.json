    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the claim:\n\n1. Identify all albums for The Beach Boys released through Caribou Records, which can be done by checking if the \"label\" or \"catalog number\" contains \"caribou\". However, it seems the table doesn't provide this information explicitly. Instead, we can assume that the US releases are under Capitol Records (a sublabel of Caribou), so we focus on those albums for The Beach Boys.\n2. For each album with multiple entries (to account for different formats - LP and CD), check if there is an overlap in \"year\" between the two entries, since the claim suggests that there is one release per format per album.\n3. If step 2 reveals no overlapping years for any album, then the claim is FALSE, as some albums only have an LP or a CD released through Caribou Records (which might not be explicitly stated in the table).\n4. If step 2 shows that there are overlapping years between LP and CD releases for all albums of The Beach Boys, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's check the relevant data:\n- For LA (Light Album), we have two entries with different years: 1979 (LP) and 1989 (CD). This album does not meet the requirement for releasing both an LP and a CD in the same year.\n- For Keepin' The Summer Alive, we also have two entries with different years: 1980 (LP) and 1991 (CD). Again, this album does not meet the requirement.\n- For Ten Years of Harmony, there are two entries for the same year (1981 LP and CD), but a later entry in 1988 as well (2CD). This album meets the requirement, but it has more than one CD release.\n- The Beach Boys album has two entries with different years: 1985 (LP) and 1985 (CD). This album does not meet the requirement.\n- Carl Wilson's eponymous album does not have a second entry, so we cannot check if it meets the requirement. However, since we found other albums that do not meet the requirement, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n   Here's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify The Beach Boys albums released through Caribou Records\",\n    \"Check if there are overlapping years between LP and CD releases for each album\",\n    \"If no overlapping years for any album, then the claim is FALSE\",\n    \"If overlapping years for all albums, then the claim is TRUE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
