Find the row that corresponds to the game on March 8 based on the date (in this case, it's the fifth row)\n3. Check if the \"visitor\" value in the fifth row matches the team specified in the claim (Minnesota)\n4. Check if the \"home\" value in the fifth row matches the team specified in the claim (Philadelphia)\n5. If both checks are true, then the game on March 8 was played by Minnesota (home) and Philadelphia (visitor), so the answer is TRUE.\n\nWith that reasoning in mind, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify column names to find relevant data\",\n    \"Find row for game on March 8 based on date\",\n    \"Check if visitor in row 5 is Minnesota\",\n    \"Check if home in row 5 is Philadelphia\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify the required information from the table. In this case, we need to find a row where both the \"visitor\" column matches 'edmonton' and the date matches 'march 9'.\n2. Check each row of data in the table, comparing them against our condition (visitor equals 'edmonton' and date equals 'march 9').\n3. If we find a match, then we can also check if the record column of that matching row is equal to '44 - 7 - 15'. This would confirm the claim.\n4. If no match is found or the record does not match '44 - 7 - 15', then the claim would be false.\n\nNow, let's find out if the claim is true or false:\n\nBy examining the data in the table, we can see that on March 9, Philadelphia was the visitor (home team in this case), not Edmonton. Therefore, Edmonton was not a visitor to Philadelphia on March 9 with a record of '44 - 7 - 15'.\n\nHere is the final answer as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the required information: Visitor should match Edmonton, Date should be March 9\",\n    \"Check each row against our condition\",\n    \"If a match is found, also check if Record equals '44 - 7 - 15'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
