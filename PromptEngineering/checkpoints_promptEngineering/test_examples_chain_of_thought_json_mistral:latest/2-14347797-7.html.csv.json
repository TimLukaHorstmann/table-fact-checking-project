However, the table only provides dates as row indices (not as column names).\n2. Check if there's a row in the data that matches the date provided in the claim by comparing the row indices with the game numbers provided in the table (since there seems to be no pattern for associating games with specific dates).\n3. If a matching row is found, compare the \"score\" column value of that row with the given score in the claim.\n4.

Iterate through the rows of the data array, comparing the date (column \"february\") with 24 and the score column (\"score\") with \"5 - 4\".\n3. If a row matches both conditions, return its index number for further verification; otherwise, continue to the next row.\n4. Upon finding a matching row, check that the date value in this row is indeed 24. This ensures that we have found the desired game on February 24.\n5. In case multiple rows match the conditions, confirm that all of them correspond to the same game (i.e., the opponent's name should be the same for all these rows).\n6.
