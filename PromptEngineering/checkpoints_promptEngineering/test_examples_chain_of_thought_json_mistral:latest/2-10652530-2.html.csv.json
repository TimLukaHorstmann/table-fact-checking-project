Identify the claim being made: The claim states that \"Paul Brown Stadium be the stadium that hold the game where 65,677 crowd attend\".\n\n2. Extract relevant data from the table:\n   - Find out which rows contain the \"stadium\" named \"Paul Brown Stadium\".\n   - Find out if any of these rows have an \"attendance\" value equal to or close to 65,677 (given the precision in the table, let's say within 100 units).\n\n3. Analyze the extracted data: If a row with the stadium named \"Paul Brown Stadium\" and attendance close to 65,677 can be found, then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's check the table for relevant rows:\n- Rows where \"stadium\" equals \"Paul Brown Stadium\": [12, 13]\n\nHowever, none of these rows have an attendance value close to 65,677.
