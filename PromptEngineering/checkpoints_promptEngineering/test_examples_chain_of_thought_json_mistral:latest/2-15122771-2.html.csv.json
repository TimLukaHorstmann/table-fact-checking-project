The table stores game data from a football season, with columns for week, date, opponent, result (win or loss), and attendance.\n2. Since the claim is about the number of wins in the 1962 season by the Washington Redskins, we need to first establish if the Washington Redskins are present in the data set and then count their wins.\n3. The table does not contain any explicit team name column, but it's common for teams to play each other more than once in a season, so we can assume that if two teams have identical results across multiple games, they must be playing each other. Let's find repeated occurrences of opponents and compare them to the Redskins schedule (if any).\n4. Search through all rows and find duplicate opponent names.\n5. Compare the duplicate opponent names with \"Washington Redskins\" or any variations that might exist in the 1960s (e.g., \"Redskins,\" \"Wash. Redskins,\" etc.)\n6. If a match is found, check the result column for those rows to determine if they are wins. Count the number of wins for those matches.\n7.
