Count the number of rows found in step 2 to determine the total number of games against the Angels. Since each row represents a game, we can directly count the rows as the number of games.\n4.

Add up the run scores for all games against the Angels (calculated in step 4) to determine the total number of runs scored by the Athletics during their 3-game series with the Angels.\n6.
