    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n   1. Identify the claim being made: The Asian record was set on September 3rd, 2004.\n   2. Examine the table structure to understand its organization: The table contains a list of records for various events in different regions. Each row represents a single record, and each column within a row corresponds to specific information about that record (e.g., name, value, location, date).\n   3. Locate the relevant row in the data array: Since we are looking for the Asian record, we will find the row where the \"world record\" column contains the string \"asian\". In this case, it's the fourth row.\n   4. Check the date from the relevant row: The date associated with the fourth row is \"3 september 2004.\"\n   5. Compare the claim and the found data: The claim was that the Asian record was set on September 3rd, 2004.
