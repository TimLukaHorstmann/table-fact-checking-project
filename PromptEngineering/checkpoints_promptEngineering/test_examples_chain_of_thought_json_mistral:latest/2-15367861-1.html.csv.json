    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there is zero loss when Corinthians score over 25 points. This means that if Corinthians score more points than their opponents, they do not lose the match.\n2. Find Corinthians in the table: In the 'team' column, look for a row where the value is \"corinthians\". Row index 6 contains this data.\n3. Identify the number of losses: In the 'lost' column, find the value for the corresponding row (row 6). The value is 1.\n4. Check if Corinthians have scored over 25 points: Look at the 'points' column for the same row. The value is 22. Since 22 is not greater than 25, Corinthians have not scored over 25 points in this data set.\n5. Determine the validity of the claim: Since Corinthians have lost a match and have not scored over 25 points, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find Corinthians in the table\",\n    \"Identify the number of losses for Corinthians\",\n    \"Check if Corinthians have scored over 25 points\",\n    \"Determine the validity of the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the relevant columns to evaluate the claim: position, team, points, lost.\n2. Find the row corresponding to \"corinthians\" based on the team name (row_index = 6).\n3. Check the value of 'lost' for \"corinthians\": The value is 10.\n4. Compare this value with less than 11: Since 10 is not greater than 11, the condition holds true.\n5. However, to provide a complete and valid answer, it is also necessary to verify that if Corinthians had 22 points, they must have played all the games (played = 22). Check this by finding the total number of games in the dataset: There are 12 teams playing, so each team plays against 11 other teams. Since every team has played 22 games (played column), Corinthians indeed have played all their games.\n6. As the condition for the claim holds true and Corinthians have played all their games, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: position, team, points, lost\",\n    \"Find 'corinthians' row\",\n    \"Check the value of 'lost'\",\n    \"Compare this value with less than 11\",\n    \"Verify that Corinthians have played all their games (played = 22)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
