    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team we're looking for - In this case, it's 'Detroit'.\n2. Identify the row corresponding to the game against Detroit - We can do this by checking each row in the table and comparing the 'team' column value with the target team name ('Detroit'). The matching row is the 1st one.\n3. Check if the score for that game is 'w 97 - 72 (ot)' - In the 1st row, under the 'score' column, we find 'w 97 - 72 (ot)'.\n4. Conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE - Since the score for the game against Detroit matches what's in the table, the claim is true.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the target team (Detroit)\", \"Find the row corresponding to the game with Detroit\", \"Check if the game score matches 'w 97 - 72 (ot)',\", \"Conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
