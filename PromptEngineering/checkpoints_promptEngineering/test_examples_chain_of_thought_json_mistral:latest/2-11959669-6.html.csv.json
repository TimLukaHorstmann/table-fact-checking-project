However, there is no direct information about the team in the table that corresponds to the high point. Instead, we have to find the game where Charlotte scored the highest points, and then check who scored those points.\n\n2. Identify the rows corresponding to each game played by Charlotte: To do this, I would iterate through the 'data' array and compare the 'team' column value with \"Charlotte\".\n\n3. Find the row(s) where the team is Charlotte and check the score column to find the highest score: After finding the relevant rows, I would look at the 'score' column values to determine which game had the highest score for Charlotte.\n\n4. Identify who scored the highest points in that game: Once we have found the highest score for Charlotte, we need to find out who scored those points by examining the 'high points' column in the identified row(s).\n\n5.
