Understand the structure of the table: The table contains data about places, players, countries, scores, and to par. Scores are given in three-digit format with a + or - symbol for strokes over or under par, respectively.\n\n3. Find Tiger Woods' row in the table: To find Tiger Woods' score, we need to search for his name (tiger woods) among the \"player\" column in the data array.\n\n4. Extract Tiger Woods' score and place from the table: Once found, we can extract his score by looking at the \"score\" column and his placing by looking at the \"place\" column.\n\n5. Convert Tiger Woods' score to a numeric value: Since Tiger Woods' score is given as \"67 + 68 + 70 = 205\", we need to subtract par (zero) from his total strokes and then add the number of strokes under par (-5). To do this, calculate the difference between his total strokes (205) and actual strokes needed for the round (e.g., 72 for par):\n   - Par for Tiger Woods' round: 72 (assuming he is playing a full 18-hole round since no holes played are specified)\n   - Actual strokes taken by Tiger Woods: 205 - 67 - 68 - 70 = 60\n   - Difference between Par and Actual Strokes: 72 - 60 = +12 (over par, but we are looking for the absolute value)\n   - Since he is under par by 5 strokes, the corrected score is 12 + 5 = 17\n\n6. Find Tiger Woods' place among other players: To find his place, we need to compare his adjusted score (corrected for strokes under/over par) with other players in the table. In this case, he has a corrected score of 17, and we will look for another player with an equal or lower corrected score.\n\n7. Verify the claim: After comparing Tiger Woods' corrected score to the scores of other players, check if there is any player with a lower corrected score (or the same score but placed higher) in the table.\n\n8. Output the final answer and relevant cells: If no such player is found, the claim \"tiger woods score a 211 placing 5th\" is FALSE because his adjusted score of 17 is not among the top 5 (since all players with scores lower than him have not been placed below him). However, since there are multiple players tied for 5th place with a score of 211 (the uncorrected score), we cannot definitively say that Tiger Woods' placement is 5th.
