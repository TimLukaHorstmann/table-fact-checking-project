    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the structure of the table. The table has a header row (columns) and multiple data rows (data). Each data row represents a different episode of the show with columns like title, directed by, written by, original air date, production code, and US viewers (million).\n\n2. Next, we need to find all the rows where the \"us viewers (million)\" column value is 2.76. We will iterate through each row in the data array and compare the 'us viewers (million)' field of each row with the claim value (2.76).\n\n3. If we find a match, it means there is at least one row where the US viewer count is 2.76 million. So, our final answer will be TRUE if such a matching row exists; otherwise, it will be FALSE.\n\n4. To determine which rows we are looking for, we can create a variable to store the matched row (if any). We will compare each row in the data array with this variable and update it when we find a match.\n\n5. After checking all the rows, we can output our final answer based on whether the matched row exists or not.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Understand the structure of the table\",\n    \"Step 2: Find all the rows where 'us viewers (million)' column value is 2.76\",\n    \"Step 3: Iterate through each row in the data array and compare its 'us viewers (million)' field with the claim value (2.76)\",\n    \"Step 4: If a match is found, update the matched row variable; otherwise continue to the next row\",\n    \"Step 5: After checking all the rows, output whether the matched row exists or not\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\" }\n  ]\n}",
