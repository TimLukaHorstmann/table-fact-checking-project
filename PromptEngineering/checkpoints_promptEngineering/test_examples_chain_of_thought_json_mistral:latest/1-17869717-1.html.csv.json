Iterate through each row in the data array to find the one where the value in the \"week\" column corresponds to 3 (as per the claim).\n3. Examine the value in the \"date\" column of the found row to see if it is equal to or close to September 30. In this case, there isn't an exact match for September 30, but week 3 game was played on September 30 (row 2).\n4. Compare the date with the closest date available in the data set.
