    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the specific row where the away team is Liverpool and the date is 30/01/1991. In the data array, rows with \"away team\" as Liverpool and \"date\" as 30/01/1991 are not present. However, there's a row with a \"replay\" as the tie no (which typically indicates a replay of a previous game), the away team is Liverpool, and the date is 30/01/1991.\n\n2. To confirm if this row represents the game we are looking for, we need to find the corresponding original game where Liverpool was the away team (since replays are games that happened as a result of the first game ending in a draw). Looking at the data, we see a previous row with Liverpool as the away team and the same date (30/01/1991) labeled as \"replay\". This indicates that this replay corresponds to an original game where Liverpool was the away team.\n\n3. To find the original game, we need to trace back to the previous game where the teams and date match those of the replay but the tie no is not \"replay\". The previous row in data array with these matching conditions has a \"tie no\" of 1 and the home team as Brighton & Hove Albion. This means that the original game before the replay had Liverpool as the away team and Brighton & Hove Albion as the home team on 26/01/1991.\n\n4. To find the score of this original game, we look at the corresponding row in the data array and see that the score is \"2 - 2\".\n\n5. Comparing this to the claim, the score was not 2 - 3 when the away team was Liverpool on the date 30/01/1991. However, the original game before the replay did end with a different score (2 - 2) where Liverpool was the away team on the same date as the replay (26/01/1991).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'away team' is Liverpool and 'date' is 30/01/1991\",\n    \"Find the original game by tracing back from the replay row\",\n    \"Determine the score of the original game\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"tie no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"home team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"away team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
