There's no explicit label or column naming this as such, but given that professional Australian Rules Football started in 1897 and had a consistent number of teams since 1908, we can reasonably assume that these are VFL/AFL games if they took place from the late 1800s to the present. Moreover, all teams listed (Footscray, Fitzroy, Carlton, St Kilda, Richmond, Essendon, Geelong, and South Melbourne) were part of the original eight teams that started the VFL in 1897 and were still active by 1961.\n\n3.
