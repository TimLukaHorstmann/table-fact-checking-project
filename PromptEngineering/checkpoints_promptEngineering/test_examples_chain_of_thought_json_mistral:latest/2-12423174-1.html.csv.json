The table consists of multiple rows and columns, with each row containing a series of values about different matches.\n2. Find the row that corresponds to \"asc diaraf\" in the second column (agg), since the claim is about this team. In our data, the row number for asc diaraf is 2.\n3. Check the fourth and fifth columns, representing the results of the first and second legs respectively, for the match between asc diaraf and stade malien. The values in these cells for asc diaraf are \"3 - 0\" (first leg) and \"0 - 4\" (second leg).\n4. Compare the scores of both legs to determine if asc diaraf lost to stade malien. A loss is typically defined as losing the first leg or winning the first leg but losing the second leg, given that each team plays two legs in a matchup. However, in this case, asc diaraf scored 3 goals at home (first leg) while stade malien only scored 0. In the away leg, asc diaraf lost with a score of 0 - 4. Since they won the first leg and lost the second leg, we cannot conclude that they lost to stade malien in this context.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Find row for 'asc diaraf'\",\n    \"Check scores of both legs (first and second)\",\n    \"Compare scores to determine if asc diaraf lost\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if the scores in the 1st leg and 2nd leg columns of this row add up to a total of 2 points according to the competition rules: If the team scored more goals in the 1st leg, then we should look at the difference (or \"agg\" value) between their total goals and their opponents' total goals.

In our case, we should look for a row where \"team 2\" is \"young africans\" and the sum of '1st leg' and '2nd leg' is either a goal difference greater than or equal to 1 (to account for an away goal) or the exact value 2 (if they won both legs).\n4.
