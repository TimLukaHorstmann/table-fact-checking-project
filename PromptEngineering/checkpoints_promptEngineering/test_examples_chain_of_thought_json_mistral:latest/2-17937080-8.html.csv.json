Find the row that corresponds to \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\" in the \"data\" array. The row index for alfredo di st\u00e9fano is 11 (since players are listed in order of rank).\n3. In the row we found, look at the column named \"goals per match\". This value is 1.0 for alfredo di st\u00e9fano.\n4. Compare the value of \"goals per match\" with the number 1.237 (as given in the claim). Since 1.0 is less than 1.237, alfredo di st\u00e9fano has less than 1.237 goals per match.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player on rank 11\",\n    \"Find the row that corresponds to the identified player in the 'data' array\",\n    \"Look at the 'goals per match' column for the found row\",\n    \"Compare the value of 'goals per match' with the number given in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify the key details from the claim: The claim states that a rank of 11.0 belongs to a player who has a goals per match value more than 1.237.\n\n2. Understand the table structure: We have a table with data about various players, including their rank, name, season, club, goals, apps, and goals per match. The lower the rank, the better the player's performance in terms of goals per match.\n\n3. Filter the data based on the given condition: To find out if there is a player with rank 11.0 who has goals per match more than 1.237, we need to check the \"goals per match\" values for rows where the \"rank\" equals 11.\n\n4. Analyze the filtered data: If any of the players with rank 11 have a goals per match value greater than 1.237, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis would be:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\" }\n]\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key details from the claim\",\n    \"Understand table structure\",\n    \"Filter data based on condition in the claim\",\n    \"Analyze filtered data to find if a rank of 11.0 has goals per match more than 1.237\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "claim": "lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Lionel Messi ranks 2 and scored 73 goals during the 2011/12 season.\n2. Determine the data structure: We have a table with two main parts - 'columns' and 'data'. The columns are headers, and the data is a list of rows with specific values for each header.\n3. Search for relevant data based on the claim: We need to find rows where the 'name' column equals \"Lionel Messi\" and the 'season' column equals \"2011 / 12\". There are two such rows in the data array.\n4. Evaluate the ranking: The first row has a rank of 1, while the second has a rank of 2. Both rows meet the criteria specified in the claim, but the second one has a lower rank (which matches the claim).\n5. Check for the goal score: In both relevant rows, the 'goals' column equals 60 and 73 respectively. Since the claim mentions a goal score of 73, we have found a match in our data.\n6. Combine the findings: Since both conditions (rank = 2 and goals = 73) are met for Lionel Messi during the 2011/12 season, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the data structure\",\n    \"Search for relevant data based on the claim\",\n    \"Evaluate the ranking\",\n    \"Check for the goal score\",\n    \"Combine the findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\" }\n  ]\n}",
