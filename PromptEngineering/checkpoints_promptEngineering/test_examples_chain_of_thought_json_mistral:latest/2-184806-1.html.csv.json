Since the claim asks for the number of different languages in the Eurovision Song Contest 1965, we don't need to consider the points, draw, artist, or place columns.\n3. Create a set (or use a function that returns unique values) to store these unique language names. In this case, we can simply compare each language with the other languages in the set and add it if it doesn't exist yet.\n4. Count the number of elements in the resulting set after all rows have been processed.\n5.
