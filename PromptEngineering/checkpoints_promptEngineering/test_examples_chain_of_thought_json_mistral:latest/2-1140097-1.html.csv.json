Check if any constructor has only one win. This can be done by checking if a constructor appears exactly once in the list of winners, which is not the case for any constructor in our list.\n\n4. The claim states that \"brabham - repco construct the fewest amount of win vehicles with only one\", but we found that there are 6 different constructors that have won races and none of them has only one win. Therefore, it is FALSE that \"brabham - repco construct the fewest amount of win vehicles with only one\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the constructor for each winning car\", \"Count the number of unique constructors\", \"Check if any constructor has only one win\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
