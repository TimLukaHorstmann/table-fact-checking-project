Identify the claim: The claim states that \"halifax blue sox be 1 of the 6 club that have no drawn record during the 1997 world club championship\".\n2.

Find the relevant club: In this case, the club in question is \"halifax blue sox\". We look for the row that contains this club name.\n4. Check the drawn column: To determine if a club has a no-draw record, we need to check the value in the \"drawn\" column. A value of 0 indicates that there were no draws for the particular club during the championship.\n5. Compare and identify: If the \"halifax blue sox\" row contains a value of 0 in the \"drawn\" column, then it means they have no drawn record. We also need to check if there are other clubs in the data with a 0 value in the \"drawn\" column as well.\n6. Count the clubs: If there are more than one club (including halifax blue sox) that have a 0 value in the \"drawn\" column, then it means that halifax blue sox is one of those clubs with no drawn record during the championship.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the context\",\n    \"Find the relevant club\",\n    \"Check the drawn column\",\n    \"Compare and identify\",\n    \"Count the clubs\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
