    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"43243 live births have a migration of - 14873\".\n2. Determine the structure of the table: The table contains data about various demographic indicators for different countries, and each row represents one country.\n3. Understand what the columns represent: The columns contain various demographic indicators such as average population, live births, deaths, natural change, migration, crude birth rate, crude death rate, natural change per 1000, and migration per 1000.\n4. Check if there is a column for \"live births\" and \"migration\": Yes, both columns are present in the table.\n5. Check if any of the rows contain data that matches the claim: The values in the \"live births\" and \"migration (per 1000)\" columns do not correspond to the numbers in the claim. The numbers in the table are in thousands, but the claim mentions a specific number of live births without the thousand separator.\n6. Conclude: The given claim is FALSE as there is no row that matches the specified live birth and migration values.\n\nHere is my output in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the structure of the table\",\n    \"Understand what the columns represent\",\n    \"Check if there is a column for 'live births' and 'migration'\",\n    \"Check if any of the rows contain data that matches the claim\",\n    \"Conclude\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
