Find the row corresponding to UKIP: We search for the row containing \"ukip\" in the \"party\" column. The corresponding row index is 9.\n\n4.

Calculate the claimed change for UKIP: According to the claim, UKIP should have a decrease in vote percentage of -4.2%. In the table, UKIP's change is \"- 6.3%\". We convert this negative value into positive to compare with the claimed value: 6.3 -> (100+6.3) = 106.3%. Now we subtract it from 100 to get the actual decrease, i.e., -100 + 106.3 = 6.3%.\n\n6.
