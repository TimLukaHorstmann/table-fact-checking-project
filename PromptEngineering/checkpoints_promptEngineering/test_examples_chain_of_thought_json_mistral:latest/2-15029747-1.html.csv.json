We also need to check if the 'result' is 'nominated' for the row that meets the above criteria.\n\n3. Examine the data: In this table, we do not have a column explicitly listing the award recipient as Brandi Love, but based on the titles of the works, it can be inferred that these rows represent Brandi Love.\n\n4. Apply the logic: We find two rows where the year is 2013 and the result is 'nominated'. In one of these rows, the work title suggests Brandi Love (big titty milfs). Therefore, this row represents a nomination for Brandi Love. However, there is no other row that matches the criteria for the 'best ass' award.\n\n5.
