To verify this, we need to find the row in the table where the place column equals 'jacksonville'.\n2. Iterate through the data: We start from the first row and move down the table, comparing each row's place value with 'jacksonville'.\n3. Find the matching row: If we find a row where the place column equals 'jacksonville', then we have found the round number for jacksonville. In this case, the 11th row has 'jacksonville' in the place column.\n4. Determine the answer: Since we have found a matching row, we can now confirm whether the claim is true or false. In this table, the 11th round belongs to jacksonville. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, here's my output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Iterate through the data\", \"Find the matching row\", \"Determine the answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"round\"}]\n}\n```",
