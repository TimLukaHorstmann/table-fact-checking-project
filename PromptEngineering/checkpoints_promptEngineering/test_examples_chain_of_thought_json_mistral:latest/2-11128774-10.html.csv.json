Identify the two conditions given in the claim: when the series is 1 - 0, attendance is 16150; when the series is 1 - 1, attendance is also 16150.\n\n2. Check which rows correspond to these series values by looking for rows where the \"series\" column matches either \"1 - 0\" or \"1 - 1\".\n\n3. For each row that matches, verify whether the value in the \"attendance\" column is indeed 16150.\n\n4. If all rows matching the series conditions have an attendance of 16150, then the claim is true; otherwise it is false.\n\nNow, let's look at the relevant data:\n- Row index 0 has a \"series\" value of \"1 - 0\". The attendance in this row is indeed 16150, so we have one match.\n- Row index 1 has a \"series\" value of \"1 - 1\". The attendance in this row is also 16150, so we have another match. No other rows meet the conditions for the series values specified.\n\nSince both instances where the series matches the given values (1 - 0 and 1 - 1) also have the correct attendance value (16150), our conclusion is that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify conditions from claim\",\n    \"Find rows with matching series values\",\n    \"Verify attendance values for those rows\",\n    \"Check if all attended matches are correct\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"series\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"series\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In addition, if these conditions are met, the score should be 3 - 5 and the date should be 'may 13'.\n\n2. Iterate through each row in the table starting from the first one. For each row:\n   a. Check if the value at the \"decision\" column matches 'mclean'. If not, move to the next row as this condition is not met.\n   b. Check if the value at the \"series\" column can be manipulated to be 2 - 4 by adding or subtracting the appropriate number of wins from one of the teams. If it cannot, move to the next row as this condition is not met. Note that we only need to check if the series score can become 2 - 4 because the home team is 'los angeles' which means the opposing team must have won more games (since they are trailing).\n   c. If the current row's \"home\" value is 'vancouver', swap the values in the \"score\", \"visitor\", and \"home\" columns. This ensures that we're considering both possible score configurations where 'los angeles' has scored 3 or more goals (since 'vancouver' is currently winning the series).\n   d. Check if the value at the current row's \"home\" column is 'los angeles'. If not, move to the next row as this condition is not met.\n   e. If all conditions have been met for the current row, check if the score values in that row are 3 and 5 respectively. If they do, the score matches the claim and we can stop iterating through the table. If they don't, move to the next row as this condition is not met.\n   f.
