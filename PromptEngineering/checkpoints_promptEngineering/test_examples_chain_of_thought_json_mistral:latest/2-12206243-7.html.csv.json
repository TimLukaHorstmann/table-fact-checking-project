    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify the table structure from the provided JSON object. The table consists of six columns (date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record) and several rows with data.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to June 13 in the \"data\" array. To do this, I will loop through each row checking if the value of the first column (date) matches \"june 13\". The relevant cells for this step are: [\"data\", x] where x is the index of the row containing the date 'june 13'.\n\n3. Extract the value of the \"record\" column from the found row as it corresponds to the claim we want to verify. The relevant cell for this step is: [\"data\", x, \"record\"] where x is the index of the row containing the date 'june 13'.\n\n4. Compare the extracted record value with the target record (29 - 32). If they match, then the answer is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nWith these steps in mind, here is the final JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure\", \"Find row for 'june 13'\", \"Extract record value for found row\", \"Compare extracted value with target record\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"record\"}]\n}\n```\nIn this case, the actual record for 'june 13' is different from the target record (30 - 29), so the answer is FALSE.",
