Check the score column: Find a row where the score has 3 wins for Mahmoud el Ali's team (indicated by the home team or first number in the score array).\n   b. Check the competition column: For the found match, ensure that the competition is a World Cup qualifier (specifically \"2010 fifa world cup qualification\" or \"2014 fifa world cup qualification\").\n   c. Repeat this for rows where Mahmoud el Ali's team lost 2: Find a row with the loss indicated by the first number in the score array being smaller than the second (e.g., [1, 3] means Mahmoud el Ali's team lost 1-3).

Next, filter the matches based on the year to check for friendly competitions in 2007 and 2008:\n   a. Filter the data for the year 2007. There is only one match that meets this criteria (row index 0). The competition type is \"friendly.\"\n   b. Filter the data for the year 2008. Three matches meet this criteria (rows indexes 1, 2, and 4). Two of these are friendly competitions (rows 1 and 4).\n\n3. Check if there are any venues in the filtered matches that correspond to Dubai or Kuwait City:\n   a. For the match in 2007, the venue is not Dubai but United Arab Emirates which does not match our requirement for Dubai. The city was not provided for the other friendly competition in 2008. So we cannot confirm if it was against Dubai or not.\n   b. For the first match in 2008, the venue is Kuwait City (row index 1). So, one of the conditions has been met.\n   c.
