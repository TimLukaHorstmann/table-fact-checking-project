Search through the data rows for the player \"seve ballesteros\". The relevant row is at index 6 with the column values as follows: place (3), player (\"seve ballesteros\"), country (\"spain\"), score (\"76 + 75 + 73 + 64 = 288\"), to par (\"+ 8\"), money (\"22000\").\n3. Check if the player \"seve ballesteros\" is from Spain (country column matches \"spain\"). Yes, it does.\n4. Determine the place of \"seve ballesteros\" in the table based on the \"place\" column value. In this case, it's 3.\n5. Check if there are other players tied for the same place as \"seve ballesteros\". By comparing the \"place\" column values, we find that rows 6 (seve ballesteros) and 7 have the same \"place\" value of 3. The player in row 7 is \"gary koch\", who also has a score of 288.\n6. Since both \"seve ballesteros\" and \"gary koch\" are tied for 6th place, there are two players tied for the 6th place. However, we're only looking for whether \"seve ballesteros\" is tied for 6th or not, so the answer remains TRUE.\n\nNow, here's the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table columns\", \"Find 'seve ballesteros'\", \"Check player's country\", \"Determine player's place\", \"Check if there are players tied for the same place\", \"Output answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\" }\n  ]\n}",
