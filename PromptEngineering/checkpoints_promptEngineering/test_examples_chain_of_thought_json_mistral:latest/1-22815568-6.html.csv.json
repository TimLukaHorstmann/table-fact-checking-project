Determine the columns in the table: From the provided table, we can see that there are six columns: \"county\", \"population\", \"unemployment rate\", \"market income per capita\", \"poverty rate\", and \"status\". The column of interest is the \"poverty rate\" as it is mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. Identify the value of interest: We need to find the rows where the poverty rate matches 11.4%. However, there is no county with a poverty rate exactly equal to 11.4% in the given table.\n\n4. Determine how close the values are to the specified threshold: To make a determination based on the claim, we can loosely interpret that if the poverty rate is very close (within a few decimal places) to 11.4%, then the status should be \"at - risk\".\n\n5. Check each row's poverty rate: Go through each row and compare the \"poverty rate\" with 11.4%. In this case, we find that the poverty rates in the table range from 8.4% (in the row for 'tioga') to 15.5% (in the rows for 'allegany' and 'cortland').\n\n6. Find the relevant cells: Since no county matches the exact poverty rate of 11.4%, there are no relevant cells in this table according to the given claim.\n\n7. Output the final answer: The claim is not applicable to the provided data since there is no county with a poverty rate exactly equal to 11.4%.
