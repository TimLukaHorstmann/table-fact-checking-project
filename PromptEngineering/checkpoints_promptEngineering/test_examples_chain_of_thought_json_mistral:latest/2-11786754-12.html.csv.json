    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the conditions given in the claim: more than 0 touchdown (td 's) and more than 135 yards (yards).\n2. From the table, filter out the rows where td 's > 0 (this will include players with at least one touchdown) and yards > 135. This filtering will give us the relevant data for our claim.\n3. Check if any of the remaining rows have an average (avg) that is equal to 5.3.\n4. If there are no rows left after the first two steps, or none of those rows have an average of 5.3, then the answer will be FALSE. Otherwise, the answer will be TRUE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify conditions given in claim (td 's > 0 and yards > 135)\",\n    \"Filter out rows from data that meet those conditions\",\n    \"Check if any of the remaining rows have an average equal to 5.3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"td 's\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"yards\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
