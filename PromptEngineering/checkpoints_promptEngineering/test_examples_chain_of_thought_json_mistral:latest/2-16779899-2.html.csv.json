Determine the row number corresponding to the date of the game on December 14, 1986. In this table, the games are listed chronologically by week, so we start from the latest date and move backwards until we find the one that matches our target date. The 16th row corresponds to the date December 21, 1986. Since there's no game on December 21, 1986 according to this table, we move back one more row (the 15th row). This is where the game on December 14, 1986 is located.\n3. Check the value in the \"result\" column for the row that corresponds to our target date.
