    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify the opponent column in the table, which contains the name of each team playing against our reference team (Minnesota North Stars) in each game.\n2. Find out when the Minnesota North Stars played their last game before March 2 (since the games are listed in chronological order by the row index). The last game they played before March 2 is on row 56, as the date for that game is 1 (January), which is before March 2.\n3. Check if any of the games after the last game they played before March 2 have them listed as opponents. To do this, we need to compare the opponent's name in each row starting from row 57 with \"Minnesota North Stars\".\n4. If no row has Minnesota North Stars listed as the opponent, then the claim is true (i.e., Minnesota North Stars are not the opponent until game 75).\n5. To verify our conclusion, we should look at the relevant rows:\n   - Row 56: This is the last game played by Minnesota North Stars before March 2.\n   - Rows starting from 57: These are the games after the last game they played before March 2. If any of these rows have \"Minnesota North Stars\" as the opponent, then our conclusion would be false.\n\nNow let's output the final answer in the requested format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify opponent column.\",\n    \"Find the last game played by Minnesota North Stars before March 2.\",\n    \"Check if any of the games after the last game they played before March 2 have them listed as opponents.\",\n    \"Verify our conclusion by looking at the relevant rows.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 56, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 58, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    ...

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be checked: The opponent for game 75 is the Minnesota North Stars with a record of 48-15-13.\n2. Determine the structure of the table: The table has two main sections - columns and data. The columns contain header names, while the data contains the rows with specific values.\n3. Locate the row corresponding to game 75: Each row in the \"data\" section represents a game, and each cell in a row corresponds to the values of that game. To find the row for game 75, we check the first column (index 0), which contains the game number. In our table, the number 75 is found in the 6th row (index 5).\n4. Check the opponent's name in row 6: The opponent's name is in the third column (index 2). In this case, it is \"minnesota north stars.\"\n5. Check the record for the Minnesota North Stars: To verify that their record is 48-15-13, we need to check if the row 6 has a value of 48 in the fourth column (index 3) for score and a value of 15 or 13 in the fifth column (index 4) for losses. In our table, the fourth column has the value \"5\" and the fifth column has the value \"12\".\n6.
