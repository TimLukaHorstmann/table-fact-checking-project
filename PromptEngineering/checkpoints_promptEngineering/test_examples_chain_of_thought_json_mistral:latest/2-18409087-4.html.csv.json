Iterate through the data array: Check each row of the table to find a match for the opponent \"New York\".\n\n3. Find the relevant row(s): If any row has an opponent that matches \"New York\", proceed to step 4. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. Extract the score and check its value: For each relevant row found in step 3, extract the score value and compare it with the desired score (111-106). If the extracted score matches the desired score, the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant rows and check the score:\n\nUsing the table provided, we can see that the 18th row has an opponent \"New York\".
