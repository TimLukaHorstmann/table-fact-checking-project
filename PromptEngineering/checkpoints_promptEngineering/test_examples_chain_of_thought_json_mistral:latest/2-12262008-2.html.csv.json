In this dataset, the stages are not explicitly labeled as such, but they can be identified by the 'final' entry in the stage column. The index of the row containing 'final' is our reference point (row_index=0). To find stage 14, we need to find the row that is 14 rows after this reference point (row_index=0+14=14).\n\n3. Check the relevant column: Once we have found the relevant row, we will check the 'intergiro classification' column for Dimitri Konyshev (column_name='intergiro classification'). If it contains his name or any value that indicates he was awarded the intergiro classification, then our claim is true.\n\n4. Evaluate the result: Based on the data provided, we find the relevant row at row_index=15.
