Each row represents a single event.\n3. Determine the relevant information: To evaluate the claim, we need to count the number of times Portugal appears as the champion in the \"champion\" column from rows 1 to 8 (1990-1998).\n4. Count the occurrences of Portugal as champions: Looking at the data, there are two instances where Portugal is listed as the champion - 1990 and 1995.\n5. Compare the count with other countries: We will now find out if any other country has won more championships than Portugal between 1990 and 1998. By examining the data, we see that Germany, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, Brazil, United States, and Great Britain each have one instance of their respective countries being the champion.\n6.
