Understand the structure of the table: The table contains data about tennis matches, with columns for year, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year.\n\n3. Check if Edgar Michalowski participated in any mixed doubles matches: To do this, we will look through the rows where the \"Name\" (implicitly, since it is not explicitly stated) corresponds to \"Edgar Michalowski.\" In our table, there is no explicit column for names, but we can identify Edgar's matches based on the pattern of consistent partners in the mixed doubles column.\n\n4. Examine each row to see if Edgar Michalowki's partner changes in mixed doubles: If the partner changes, it indicates that a new match has started, and thus Edgar played a different mixed doubles match. However, in our table, we can observe that Edgar always plays with the same partner (Monika Cassens) in mixed doubles.\n\n5. Determine if Edgar participated in only mixed doubles matches: Since Edgar's partner does not change in mixed doubles and he doesn't seem to participate in any other events, it is reasonable to conclude that all of his matches were in the mixed doubles category.\n\nNow, let us output the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim statement: 'edgar michalowski played all his matches in mixed doubles'.\",\n    \"Understand the structure of the table.\",\n    \"Check if Edgar Michalowki participated in any mixed doubles matches.\",\n    \"Examine each row to see if Edgar's partner changes in mixed doubles.\",\n    \"Determine if Edgar participated in only mixed doubles matches.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": <row index for the first year Edgar played>,\n      \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": <row index for the last year Edgar played>,\n      \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the columns of interest for determining if Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens have ever partnered up in mixed doubles, which are \"mixed doubles\" and any other columns that may contain their names.\n2.

Similarly, check if the name \"Monika Cassens\" is present in the \"women's singles\", \"women's doubles\", or \"mixed doubles\" column.\n   c. If both Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens are found in the same row (in either \"men's doubles\" or \"women's doubles\"), go to step 3. Otherwise, continue with the next row.\n\n3. Check if the names \"Edgar Michalowski\" and \"Monika Cassens\" appear together in the \"mixed doubles\" column for the current row.
