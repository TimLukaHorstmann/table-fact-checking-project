Go through the rest of the data rows to check for other instances where \"maroon 5\" is in the artist column and the \"highest position\" value is greater than 1. However, no such row was found.\n6.

Look through the table to find the row that matches the specified album name. The album name is not present in the table, so it appears that the table does not contain the data for the album \"American Idol\".

Examine the rest of the album titles in the table to see if any are similar to \"American Idol\". The closest match is \"American Idiot\" by Green Day.\n4. Find the row corresponding to Green Day's American Idiot album. The relevant row can be found at index 18, with the column name \"album_name\" matching \"Green Day\" and the column name \"album_title\" matching \"American Idiot\".\n5. Check if the sales for Green Day's American Idiot exceed 870,000. In the table, the album sale data is represented by the number in the same row under the column name \"sales\".
