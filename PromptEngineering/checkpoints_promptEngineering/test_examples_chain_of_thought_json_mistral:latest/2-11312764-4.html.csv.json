Next, find the row that corresponds to Linda Fratianne and Anett P\u00f6tzsch in the table (sorted by rank). We see Linda Fratianne at index 0 with a rank of 1, and Anett P\u00f6tzsch at index 1 with a rank of 2.\n\n3. Examine their respective points to determine who has the highest score. If Linda Fratianne has a higher score than Anett P\u00f6tzsch, then it can be concluded that Linda Fratianne is the winner and Anett P\u00f6tzsch comes in second place.\n\n4. Check the \"points\" column for both skaters:\n   - Linda Fratianne has 186.92 points.\n   - Anett P\u00f6tzsch has 184.36 points.\n\n5.
