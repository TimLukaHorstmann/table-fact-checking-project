    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. To evaluate the claim, we need to find out the average position of Juventus (row 7) and compare it with the value given for \"position\" (which should be 7).\n2. Next, we will find out the total \"against\" points (the sum of all the \"difference\" values in rows where team names match the one for Juventus, row 7). This will give us the total number against which Juventus has played.\n3. Finally, we will calculate the average position by dividing the row_index value of Juventus (7) by the total number of teams in the table and compare it with the given position (7). If they are equal, the claim is true.\n4. To find the total \"against\" points, we will sum up all the values under the \"difference\" column for the rows where the \"team\" value matches the one for Juventus (row 7).\n5. After finding the total \"against\" points, we will check if it equals the value given for \"49 against\".

Identify the claim's requirements: The claim states that team \"Juventus\", who has 20 points, less than 57 against (goals conceded), and 2 drawn matches, should be at an average position of 7.\n\n2. Find the row of team Juventus in the table: We need to search for a row where the \"team\" column equals \"Juventus\". In this case, it is the seventh row with index 6.\n\n3. Check if the points and drawn matches match the claim's requirements: For team \"Juventus\", we find that they have 18 points (not 20 as stated in the claim), which does not meet the first requirement. Also, they have 9 drawn matches, not 2 as claimed. So both conditions are not met.\n\n4. If the first condition is met, find the position of the team: If the number of points and drawn matches matched the claim's requirements, we would then compare all rows where the points match the given number (in this case, 20), and choose the average of their positions.

    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n   1. Identify the team we're looking for in the table, which is Santos. We can find it based on its name in the \"team\" column. In this case, the row with index 6 has the team name \"santos\".\n   2. Check the number of points for Santos. The \"points\" value in the row with index 6 is 20.\n   3. Compare the number of points for Santos (20) with the claimed number of points (21). Since they do not match, it appears that there is a mistake in the claim.\n   4. However, we should still check the rest of the claim as the table might contain additional incorrect information. The remaining parts of the claim are about the average lost, difference, and \"against\".\n   5. Find the average lost for Santos by looking at the number of lost games in the row with index 6 and dividing it by the total number of games played (20). In this case, the number of lost games is 8, so the average lost would be 8/20 = 0.4. This does not match the claimed average lost of 10.\n   6. Check the difference for Santos by looking at the value in the \"difference\" column for the row with index 6. The difference is \"-2\".\n   7. Finally, find the number against for Santos by looking at the value in the \"against\" column for the row with index 6. In this case, the number against is 41.\n\n   Since there is a discrepancy between the claimed points (21) and actual points (20), we will not verify the rest of the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify Santos in the table by its team name, check the number of points for Santos, compare it with the claimed number of points (21), find the average lost for Santos, difference, and against using relevant columns\", \"Discover that the claimed points do not match the actual points, but still verify the rest of the claim\", \"Find that the average lost, difference, and against do not match the claimed values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\"}]\n}",
