To do that, we need to find out if there's any information about the draft round for each player. Unfortunately, the table does not provide this information explicitly, and all it says about their draft status is whether they signed with a team or not. Since neither of these players has any mention of being drafted by a specific team in a specific year, we cannot verify the claim based on this table alone.\n\nWith that said, since we don't have enough information to confirm the claim (because there are no rows where both conditions - position 1b and round 4 or 5 - hold true), we must output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify positions of players in the table\",\n    \"Check if any of these positions are first baseman (1b)\",\n    \"Find out if their draft round is either 4 or 5\",\n    \"Unable to verify claim due to lack of required information\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Since both players in question haven't signed, we cannot definitively determine their draft status based on this information alone.\n\n3.

However, this information is not provided in the table.\n\n4.
