If such a row exists, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nBased on the data provided in the table, there's only one match where Sergio Roitman was the opponent and the score matched the given '7 - 5, 6 - 4'.

The table structure is verified to be correct.\n   2. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"Cipolla loses a match against Tobias Kamke with a score of 2-6, 5-7\". We need to find a row in the table where both 'opponent' and 'score' match the specified player (Tobias Kamke) and the specified score (2-6, 5-7).\n   3. Iterate through the table data: Compare each row with the specified opponent (Tobias Kamke) and look for a match in the 'opponent' column.
