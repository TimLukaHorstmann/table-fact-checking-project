Check the table for data related to the specified game date. Since the given date is \"november 4\", we look for rows where the \"date\" column has this value.\n3. Inspect the relevant rows: In our table, there is one row (row_index=8) where the \"date\" column matches \"november 4\".\n4. Verify the claim against the data in the table: The result column for this row contains the string \"w 10 - 3\", which matches the claimed score.\n5. Final answer: Based on our analysis, it is safe to say that the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Check the table for data related to the specified game date\",\n    \"Inspect the relevant rows\",\n    \"Verify the claim against the data in the table\",\n    \"Final answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the table data structure: The provided data is a JSON object containing two main parts, `columns` and `data`. The columns represent the column headers, while the data consists of lists of values for each row.\n\n2. Understand the claim: The claim states that in week 15, the attendance at the \"kingdome\" was 60038. We need to find the row corresponding to week 15 and check if the value for the \"attendance\" column matches 60038.\n\n3. Locate the relevant row: To find the row for week 15, we start by looking at the values in the first column of the `data` array (which represents the weeks). Since the table starts from week 1, we need to find the index of the row that corresponds to week 15. There are 15 rows in total, so the relevant row index is 14.\n\n4. Check the attendance value: Now that we have found the relevant row (at index 14), we can check if the \"attendance\" value matches 60038. In this case, the \"attendance\" for the 14th row is indeed 60038.\n\n5.
