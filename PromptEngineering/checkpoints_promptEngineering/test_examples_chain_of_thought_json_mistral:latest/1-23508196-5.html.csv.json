For each identified unit, find the number of officers using the corresponding columns \"officers\" in the data table.\n3. Compare the number of officers in the two groups (very heavy bombardment and heavy bombardment) to determine if there are 3 more officers in the heavy bombardment group.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant units:\n- The unit that belongs to the very heavy bombardment group is on row index 0 with \"type of unit\" as \"very heavy bombardment group\".\n- The units that belong to the heavy bombardment group are on rows 1 and 2, with \"type of unit\" as \"heavy bombardment group\".\n\nAfter comparing the number of officers in each unit:\n- In row 0 (very heavy bombardment group), there are 462 officers.\n- In row 1 (first heavy bombardment group), there are 465 officers.\n- In row 2 (second heavy bombardment group), there are 465 officers as well.\n\nNow, let's compare the number of officers between the two groups:\n- The heavy bombardment group has a total of 930 officers (465 + 465).\n- The very heavy bombardment group has 462 officers.\n- Comparing both results in a difference of 468 - 462 = 6 officers, which is not equal to the claim of 3 more officers.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning process, here's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the units that belong to very heavy bombardment group and heavy bombardment group.\",\n    \"Find the number of officers for each identified unit using the 'officers' column.\",\n    \"Compare the number of officers in the two groups (very heavy bombardment and heavy bombardment) to determine if there are 3 more officers in the heavy bombardment group.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"officers\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"officers\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"officers\" }\n  ]\n}",
