    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Denny Hulme was the driver at Anderstorp in 1973.\n2. Extract the relevant data from the table: Scan through the table to find the rows where the 'driver' is Denny Hulme and the 'location' is Anderstorp. Also, check if the 'year' matches 1973.\n3. Check the extracted data for a match with the claim: If any of the rows match both the driver being Denny Hulme and the location being Anderstorp, and the year also equals 1973, then the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Extract relevant data\", \"Check for a match between the claim and the extracted data\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
