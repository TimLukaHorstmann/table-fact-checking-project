First, identify all unique directors from the table by reading through each row (except for the first one which contains column names) and extracting the \"directed by\" value for each.

Then, check how many rows there are in the table (excluding the first one). Let's call this `num_rows`.\n\n4. If there are more than one director and if there are at least two episodes, then we can potentially find a case where a single director directs two episodes. In other words, if `num_unique_directors > 1` and `num_rows > num_unique_directors`, then it is possible that the claim may be true.\n\n5. To confirm that there are indeed directors who directed two episodes, we need to iterate through each unique director and check how many episodes they have directed. If for any unique director, we find that they have directed exactly 2 episodes, then the claim is true.\n\n6. As we go through each unique director in step 5, we keep track of their episode count and also store the row indices of the episodes they directed (in case we need to prove our result).
