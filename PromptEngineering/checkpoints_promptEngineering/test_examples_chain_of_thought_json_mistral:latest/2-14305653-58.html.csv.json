However, it's not immediately clear which of these two countries represents Yugoslavia.\n\n2.

Examine the results for each match to check if they're 2:1 wins: Once we have the friendly matches identified, we'll examine their respective results (column 'results') to see if any of them are a 2:1 win for Yugoslavia. This will allow us to confirm or deny the claim.\n\n4. Evaluate the findings: Based on our analysis, we can determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. If both matches were friendly games and one of them was won by Yugoslavia with a score of 2:1, then the claim would be true.
