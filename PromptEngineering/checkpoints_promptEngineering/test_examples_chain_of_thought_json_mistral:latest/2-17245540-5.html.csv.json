The columns are \"place\", \"player\", \"country\", \"score\", and \"to par\".\n\n2. Since we are asked whether Gene Borek is from the United States, I will focus on finding the row where the player's name is \"gene borek\" and the country's name is \"united states\".\n\n3. Check each row in the table to find a match for both the player's name and country's name. In this case, the 7th row has the player's name as \"gene borek\" and the country's name as \"united states\".\n\n4. To verify that the claim is correct, it's important to confirm that being from the United States doesn't necessarily mean having a lower score or being tied for a certain place. So, I will not consider the placement, score, or to par columns in this case.\n\n5.

Check for the players' positions in the tournament. The table includes row numbers which indicate their position. Rows with the same number are tied for the same place.\n\n3. Analyze if there are any combinations where a player from the US is tied with a player from New Zealand.\n\n4. Examine the rows where players are tied (marked as \"t\" followed by a number). We find ties at positions 3, 6, and 7. However, all of these tied players are from the United States, so they cannot be tied with a player from New Zealand.\n\n5. Look for any other rows that may indicate a tie between a player from the US and one from New Zealand. If such a pair exists, they would not have the same row number, but their scores (sum of strokes in \"score\" column) should be equal, and the difference from par (in \"to par\" column) should also be the same.\n\n6.
