The 'Home' team can be either Indians or Tigers, so we will search for either team in both the Home and Away columns.\n\n4. After going through all the rows, we compare the attendance of each game with the previously found maximum attendance to find out if there's a more attended game on June 8 against the Brewers (or any other opponent for that matter).
