Determine the total goals for the found player by locating the row and column indexes of the 'total goals' cell, which are both 2 (since it is the second cell in the last row).\n4. Read the value at this location to get the total number of goals scored by Mark Lillis in the season.\n5. Iterate through all other rows in the data array to find any player who has scored more goals than Mark Lillis (if one exists). This involves comparing the 'total goals' column with all other values in this column except for the row found in step 2.\n6.
