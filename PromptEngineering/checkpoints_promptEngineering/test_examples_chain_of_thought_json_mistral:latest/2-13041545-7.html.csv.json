    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the opponent for the game where Turnbow (4 - 8) took a loss, since the claim states that he is the pitcher who lost a game. In this dataset, we can see that Turnbow pitched in the games ending with a score of 62-65, 62-66, 62-68, and 62-70.\n\n2. Find the game where Turnbow took the loss among those listed above. The number of losses for a pitcher is recorded in the dataset as wins minus the number of games won plus the number of games lost. So, we are looking for the game where the opposing team's score is greater than 62 (since Turnbow has already won one game).\n\n3. Inspect the remaining games to find the one where Turnbow took a loss and the final score was 61-54. We can see that in the game ending with a score of 62-70, Turnbow took a loss (as his record is 4-8), but the final score is not 61-54.\n\n4. Continue inspecting the remaining games. In the game ending with a score of 62-69, we can see that Turnbow took a loss (since his record is 4-8) and the opposing team scored more runs than in our target score (61). However, in this game, the final score was not 61-54.\n\n5. In the game ending with a score of 62-67, we can see that Turnbow took a loss (since his record is 4-8) and the opposing team scored more runs than in our target score (61). Furthermore, this game's final score matches the target score (62-61).\n\nSince the final score of the game where Turnbow took the loss was indeed 62-61, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games pitched by 'turnbow (4 - 8)', filter out games where Turnbow won\",\n    \"Find the game(s) where Turnbow took a loss\",\n    \"Inspect each game, check if the final score is less than 61-54, and find the game that matches the target score\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the scores that are 1 - 3, by looking at the \"score\" column for rows where the first value (before the dash) is 1 and the second value (after the dash) is between 0 and 3. This includes row indices [80, 102].\n2. For each game with a score of 1 - 3, find its corresponding attendance, by looking at the \"Attendance\" column for rows identified in step 1. This gives us two values: 41222 (for row 80) and 10226 (for row 102).\n3. Compare the found attendance values to determine which one is smaller.
