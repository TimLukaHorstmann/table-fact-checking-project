In our table, the second row (ep 2) has the romanized title \"arienai kisu\".\n\n3. Compare the two identified rows: To check the claim, we need to determine if the second row (the one with the title \"arienai kisu\") was broadcast 7 days after the first row (the one with the earliest broadcast date). In our table, the difference between the broadcast dates of these two episodes is not exactly 7 days.
