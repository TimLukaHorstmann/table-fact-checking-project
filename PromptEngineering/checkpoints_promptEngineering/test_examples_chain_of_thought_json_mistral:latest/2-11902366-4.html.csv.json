Determine whether there's a non-zero value in the \"score\" column for the New Jersey Devils in each game: If the score for the New Jersey Devils is not zero (i.e., they scored), then it means that at least one game ended with a score other than 0-0.\n4. Compare the total number of non-zero scores against the total number of games played by the New Jersey Devils: If there are no non-zero values, it would mean that all their games ended without a score for the New Jersey Devils.\n5. Verify if there's a pattern in the \"decision\" column that could indicate any missed entries: The \"decision\" column indicates the goalie who played for the New Jersey Devil team.
