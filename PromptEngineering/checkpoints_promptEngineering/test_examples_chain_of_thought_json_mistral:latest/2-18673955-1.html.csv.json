    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the date specified in the claim: October 30, 1977.\n2. Look through the table to find the row(s) where the \"date\" column matches the given date.\n3. Compare the value in the \"week\" column for these rows with the value 7 (representing week 7).\n4. Determine if any of the matching rows have a higher value in the \"week\" column than 7.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date specified in the claim (October 30, 1977)\",\n    \"Look through the table to find the row(s) where the 'date' column matches the given date\",\n    \"Compare the value in the 'week' column for these rows with the value 7 (representing week 7)\",\n    \"Determine if any of the matching rows have a higher value in the 'week' column than 7\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: The table shows that the game played on October 30, 1977, has a week number of 7. So, there is no game that was played on October 30, 1977 listed after week 7 (since it's in week 7 itself).",
