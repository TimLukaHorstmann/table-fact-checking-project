Locate the relevant data row: To find the attendance on May 28, we need to find the data row where the date matches \"may 28\". In this table, the third row has the matching date.\n4. Verify the expected value: Check if the value in the \"attendance\" column of the relevant row (row_index=2, column_name=\"attendance\") is equal to 17132.

In our table, the only row with a score of \"0 - 4\" is at row_index=0, and its attendance value is 20066.
