Identify the specific condition to check in the table: Whether there is a women's double team consisting of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey when Jamie van hooijdonk competes in the men's single.\n\n2. Find Jamie van hooijdonk's row by looking for his name in the \"mens singles\" column. His row index is 9.\n\n3. Check the year corresponding to Jamie van hooijdonk's row (2010) and ensure it matches with a row where either Kerry Ann Sheppard or Caroline Harvey appears in both women's doubles and one of them (or both) appears in the same row as the partner for that specific year.\n\n4. Look for Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey in the \"womens doubles\" column in rows before and after Jamie van hooijdonk's row. However, there is no need to check their appearances together since if they are both in the same row (same women's doubles team), it would have been mentioned in the \"data\" array as one string separated by a comma.\n\n5. If we find either Kerry Ann Sheppard or Caroline Harvey in the women's doubles column in rows before or after Jamie van hooijdonk's row, and their names are not part of the mixed doubles team with Jamie van hooijdonk for that same year, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow let's examine the relevant cells:\n\n- For Jamie van hooijdonk in the men's singles (row_index=9, column_name=\"mens singles\")\n- For Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey in the women's doubles (rows 5, 7, and 8 for Kerry Ann Sheppard; rows 6, 7, and 8 for Caroline Harvey)\n\n   The final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
