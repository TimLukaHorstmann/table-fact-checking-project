Iterate through each row of the table (data array) to count the number of games each team played against the Brewers in June 1989. For consistency, we will only consider rows where the opponent column matches \"brewers\".\n3. Initialize a variable to store the count for the Brewers games and another variable to store the maximum count found so far (initially set to 0).\n4. Iterate through the rows again, incrementing the count of Brewers games whenever the opponent column matches \"brewers\".\n5. Compare the current count with the maximum count found so far. If the current count is equal to or greater than the maximum count, then we do not need to consider any more rows because the Blue Jays played at least as many games against another team in June 1989. If the current count is less than the maximum count, then we continue iterating through the rows.\n6. Once we have finished iterating through all the rows and found a team that has played more games against the Brewers than the Blue Jays, we can conclude that the Blue Jays did not play more games against the Brewers than any other team in June 1989.\n7. If we finish iterating through all the rows without finding another team that has played more games against the Brewers than the Blue Jays, then we can conclude that the Blue Jays may have played more games against the Brewers than any other team in June 1989 (though it is possible that there are ties with other teams).\n\nAfter applying this reasoning process to the given table, we find that the Blue Jays did not play more games against the Brewers than any other team in June 1989.

If we want to find out if the average attendance for any team exceeds 30000 people per game, we need to sum up all the attendance values and divide it by the total number of games played by that team.\n3. Since the table doesn't provide a way to isolate the data for one specific team, we cannot definitively answer the claim as it stands.\n4. However, if we were to assume that the team playing most games in this dataset is the one attending the highest number of people (the Blue Jays could be that team), then we can still perform a rough estimate.\n5.
