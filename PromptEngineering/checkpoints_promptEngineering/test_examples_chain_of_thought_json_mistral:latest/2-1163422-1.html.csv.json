    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the team name from the claim: \"evansville triplet\"\n2. Find the row in the table where the team name matches the claim. Since the team name in the table doesn't exactly match \"evansville triplet\", we cannot find an exact match and will have to look for potential misspellings or abbreviations. In this case, it seems that \"triplets\" might be an abbreviation of \"three - i league\".\n3. Check if the sport in the claim matches any sport in the table: \"baseball\" (from the claim) matches \"baseball\" in some rows in the table.\n4. Since the league isn't specified in the claim, we will look for all rows with a \"league\" column containing an abbreviation of \"three - i league\".\n5. For each row found in step 4, verify if the \"class\" matches \"aaa\" from the claim: No such match is found in the table.\n6. Finally, check if there are any championships for the team found in step 4, and if they correspond to the years specified in the claim (1946, 1948, 1956, 1957). The only matching team found is \"evansville braves\", but it won championships from 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957 in the \"three - i league\" (not \"aaa\").\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify team name\",\n    \"Find row where the team name matches the claim or potential misspellings/abbreviations\",\n    \"Check if sport matches baseball\",\n    \"Look for rows with a league column containing an abbreviation of three - i league\",\n    \"Verify if class matches aaa\",\n    \"Check if there are any championships for the team and if they correspond to the years specified in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"league\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"class\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"championships\" }\n  ]\n}",
