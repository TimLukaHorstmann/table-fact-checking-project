The results are categorized as \"re - elected\", \"retired\", or specific results if there was a contest.\n\n3. Determine which rows represent incumbents: Since we're looking for incumbents, we focus on the rows where the \"result\" is either \"re - elected\" or indicates a contest. Rows with \"retired\" or any other specific result are not considered as they do not represent incumbents in 1822.\n\n4. Identify if there are any retirees: In this table, we don't find any retirees for the specified North Carolina districts. This means all listed representatives were still active and could potentially be re-elected in 1822.\n\n5. Conclude: Since no retiring incumbents are found in the data, according to the claim, all incumbent North Carolina US House representatives would be re-elected in 1822 if they didn't retire.

Identify the years when incumbents were first elected: This will help us determine if there has been a party change within two consecutive elections (1821 to 1822).

For example, district 2 has no mention of a new candidate, but we don't know if that means the same person was elected again or not.\n   b) If the incumbent is running for re-election and there is more than one candidate in the \"candidates\" column, then there might be a party change if the other candidate belongs to a different party. For example, in district 7, we see two candidates (one from the federalist party and another from the Democratic-Republican party).\n\n3.
