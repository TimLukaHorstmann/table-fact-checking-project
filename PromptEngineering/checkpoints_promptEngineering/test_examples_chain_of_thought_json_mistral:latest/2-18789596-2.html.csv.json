After sorting the data, we will examine the country name of each row to determine if it belongs to Europe or Asia. We can assume that all countries listed are either from Europe or Asia, as synchronized swimming is not commonly practiced outside these two continents.\n5.

To check if it's higher than the average of other European/Asian countries, we first need to calculate the mean score for all the remaining countries (excluding Switzerland).\n\n5.
