    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the columns in the table that contain relevant information about the players. In this case, we are interested in the \"player\" and \"country\" columns.\n2. Examine each row to find David Frost's data in the table. Since his name appears in the third row, we will focus on that row.\n3. Check the \"player\" column of the selected row to confirm if it contains David Frost. It does.\n4. Now, verify the country of the player by checking the \"country\" column of the selected row. In this case, it is \"south africa\".\n5. Since David Frost is not from the United States (as stated in the claim), my conclusion based on the given table data is that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns\", \"Examine each row for David Frost's data\", \"Check 'player' column to confirm player name\", \"Verify country of the player in the 'country' column\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
