The claim does not directly refer to 'yards' or 'long', so they will not be needed in this case.\n\n2. Filter the data based on the condition given in the claim, i.e., where `average` is less than 2.6. In the provided table, only two players, Skip Hicks and Brad Johnson, have an average of less than 2.6.\n\n3. Identify the number of touchdowns for these filtered players. In this case, both Skip Hicks and Brad Johnson have 1 touchdown each.\n\n4. Compare the total number of touchdowns to the count obtained in step 3. If they match, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for our analysis would be:\n- { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"average\" } (for Skip Hicks)\n- { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\" } (for Brad Johnson)\n- { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\" } (for Skip Hicks)\n- { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\" } (for Brad Johnson)\n\nHere's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant column names: player, attempts, average, touchdowns\", \"Filter data based on average less than 2.6\", \"Find number of touchdowns for filtered players\", \"Compare total number of touchdowns to count obtained in step 3.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"average\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}]\n}",

As a result, it's impossible to find the corresponding \"long\" value for 19 attempts since the table doesn't contain such an entry.

The columns are [\"player\", \"attempts\", \"yards\", \"average\", \"long\", \"touchdowns\"] and the data is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row with the values for each column.\n\n2. Find the row that corresponds to \"larry centers\". To do this, compare the player names in the data with the given name (\"larry centers\"). In the data, we find Larry Centers at the second index (row 1).\n\n3. Check if the value in the \"attempts\" column for the found row matches the claim. The value in the \"attempts\" column for row 1 is 19.\n\n4. Check if the value in the \"yards\" column for the found row matches the claim. The value in the \"yards\" column for row 1 is 103.\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I need to identify the player we are looking for in the table. The claim states that the player named \"skip\" has no touchdowns. In our data, we can see that the player name in each row is located at `columns[0]` (which corresponds to 'player').\n2. Next, I look for a row where the player's name is \"skip\". Since the data is indexed from 0, if there is a player named \"skip\", it will be in the fourth row because that's where our table starts with an index of 0. So, `data[3]['player']` should equal 'skip'.\n\n3. If the name matches, I check the value at the column labeled 'touchdowns', which is located at `columns[4]`. The touchdowns are represented as integers, and a value of zero (0) indicates no touchdowns. In our case, since we are looking for \"skip\", I will look at the value at `data[3]['touchdowns']` if the player's name is 'skip'.\n\nNow let me provide the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row containing 'player' named 'skip'\",\n    \"Check the value of the column labeled 'touchdowns' for that row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
