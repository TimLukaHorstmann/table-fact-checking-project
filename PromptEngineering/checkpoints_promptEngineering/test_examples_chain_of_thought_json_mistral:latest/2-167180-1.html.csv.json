First, we look at the table (data array) to find the relevant row that contains the movie \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\".\n2. We search for a title that matches \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" in the 'title' column and find it in the 4th row.\n3. Next, we check the 'director (s)' column in the same row to see who directed the movie.\n4. We find George Lucas listed as the director for \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" in the 4th row.\n5. Since we found George Lucas listed as the director, our conclusion is that George Lucas did direct Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\n\nThe final answer in a valid JSON object format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Search table for movie 'Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones',\",\n    \"Find the row where title matches, which is the 4th row.\",\n    \"Check the director (s) column in the same row to find George Lucas.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
