This information is located in the \"crowd\" column.\n2. We then sort the teams based on their crowd size while they were away, from least to greatest. This will allow us to determine which team had the smallest crowd when they were the away team.\n3. After sorting, we can see that \"fitzroy\" (with 29947 people in attendance) and \"melbourne\" (also with 29947 people in attendance) were the home teams on the specified date, so we don't need to consider their crowd sizes during this comparison.\n4. Now, let's examine the remaining rows to find out which team was the away team when they had the least amount of spectators. In this case, \"windy hill\" had 12800 people, \"victoria park\" had 20700 people, and \"princes park\" had 14636 people.\n5. The smallest crowd size among the away teams is at \"windy hill\", which corresponds to the row with index 1 in our table.\n6. To find out who was the away team at \"windy hill\", we check the \"away team\" column and see that it's \"essendon\".\n7.
