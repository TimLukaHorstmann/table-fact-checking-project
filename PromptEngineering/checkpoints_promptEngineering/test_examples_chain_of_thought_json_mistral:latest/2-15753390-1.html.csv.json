If the total number of rows is even, then exactly half of the riders can have a time less than 2 minutes, and the other half can have a time greater than or equal to 2 minutes. Let's verify this by counting those who completed the race in under 2 minutes (less than 120 seconds since the time is in minutes:seconds format) and comparing it with half of the total number of riders.\n\n3. To do that, I will iterate through the rows, check if the 'time' column value is less than 120 seconds (converted to seconds), and keep a count of those who completed in under 2 minutes.
