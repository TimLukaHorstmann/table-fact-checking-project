Since there is no unique identifier for players in this table, this will require manually searching for Austin Daye's name in the \"team\" column.\n\n2. Once we find a row where Austin Daye scored 16 points, we need to verify if that score is indeed the highest among all scores in the table. This can be done by comparing the value in the \"high points\" column of the found row with the values in the same column for all other rows.\n\n3.
