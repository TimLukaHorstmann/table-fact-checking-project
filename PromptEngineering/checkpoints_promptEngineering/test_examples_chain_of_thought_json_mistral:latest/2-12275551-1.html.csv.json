Identify the years of interest: In this case, we are looking for the longest gap between 2009 and any year after it up to but not including 2013.\n\n2. Iterate through the data row by row from the year 2010 to 2013: For each row, find the corresponding year value and compare it with the years from 2009 onwards. If a match is found, continue to the next year. If no match is found or if we reach the end of the data without finding a match, we can conclude that there is a gap of at least 4 years between 2009 and this row's year.\n\n3. If a gap of at least 4 years is found, store the relevant cells for further confirmation: In this case, the relevant cells would be the ones with the year equal to or greater than 2010 (the first potential starting year of a 4-year gap) and the year less than 2009 (the last ending year of the potential 4-year gap).\n\nNow, let's check the data:\n\n1.
