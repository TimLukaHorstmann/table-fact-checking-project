    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the table structure to understand the data it contains. The table consists of six rows (positions 1-6) and five columns (position, name, played, drawn, lost, points).\n2. Understand the claim given: \"sg (n) didn't have a drawn larger than zero so the lost that have a position larger than 3 cannot be found.\" This implies that if sg(n) has no draws, then any team with a position greater than 3 that has also lost cannot be found in the table.\n3. Determine whether \"sg (n)\" has a drawn value larger than zero by checking the relevant row for \"name\" equal to \"sg m\\u00e3\\u00bcnchen (n)\". In this case, the drawn value is 0.\n4. Check whether there are any teams with a position greater than 3 and lost more than once. To do that, filter out rows where \"position\" > 3 and check if the \"lost\" column has a value greater than 1 for each remaining row. In this table, only one team (ec pfaffenhofen ii) has a position greater than 3 and lost more than once.\n5. Compare the teams found in step 4 with the initial team in step 3. Since ec pfaffenhofen ii is not \"sg m\\u00e3\\u00bcnchen (n)\", the lost teams with positions greater than 3 cannot be found because sg(n) doesn't have any draws.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Understand the given claim\",\n    \"Check whether 'sg (n)' has drawn greater than zero\",\n    \"Determine if there are any lost teams with positions greater than 3\",\n    \"Compare the found teams with the initial team\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\" }\n  ]\n}",
