However, considering that this data represents a hypothetical scenario where Detroit is playing as the away team (Raptors), we will proceed with this assumption.\n\n2. Determine the row number corresponding to May 2: The date for each record in the table is given, and we can find the row by comparing the dates with \"may 2\". In this case, row number 5 corresponds to May 2.\n\n3. Examine the columns relevant to finding the leading scorer: High points for a particular game are listed under the column named \"high points\". We will look at the value in the \"high points\" column of row 5.\n\n4. Examine the columns relevant to finding the leading rebounder: High rebounds for a particular game are listed under the column named \"high rebounds\". We will look at the value in the \"high rebounds\" column of row 5.\n\n5. Compare the values found in steps 3 and 4 with all other rows to confirm if Dell Curry has the highest points and rebounds on May 2: In this case, we can see that Dell Curry scored 17 points (row 5) which is higher than any other score for Detroit on any game date.
