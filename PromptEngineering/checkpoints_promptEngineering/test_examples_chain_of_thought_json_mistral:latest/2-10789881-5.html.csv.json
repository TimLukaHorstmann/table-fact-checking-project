Examine the table structure: The table consists of a \"columns\" array (containing column names) and a \"data\" array (containing rows). Each row represents a game, with each element in the row corresponding to a specific column.\n\n3. Search for the relevant row: To verify if there is a row that matches Footscray as the away team and Melbourne as the home team. Since the table columns are \"home team\", \"away team\", we can iterate over the rows to find a match.\n\n4. Check the crowd column in the found row: Once we have the relevant row, we will check the value in the 4th (crowd) position of that row as it corresponds to the crowd for that game.\n\n5.

Since we don't know the specific home team, we cannot definitively find the row at this stage. However, we can look for any row where the \"home team score\" matches \"10.11 (71)\".\n3. Once we have identified a row with the matching \"home team score\", compare the \"venue\" column of that row to determine if it's the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\n4.

Identify the claim: The claim is about a match between Hawthorn and Richmond on May 30, 1931, and the attendance at Princess Park.\n\n2. Check if the table contains rows with the specified teams playing on the given date: The table has multiple rows that list the date as \"30 may 1931\". However, we need to find a row where both Hawthorn and Richmond are listed as home and away teams respectively.\n\n3. Verify that the venue is Princess Park for the matching teams: If a row with the specified teams exists, we need to check if the venue is indeed Princess Park. In this case, none of the rows match both conditions (Hawthorn and Richmond playing on 30 may 1931 at Princess Park).\n\n4.
