The United States is not included in the table, but since it's part of North America, we will add it to our list as well.\n\n2. Count the total medals won by North American nations: In this case, the only North American nations with data are Canada (1 bronze medal) and Mexico (1 gold medal). So, the total medals won by North American nations is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n3. Compare the number of medals won by North America to the total number of medals: The total number of medals in the table (representing all countries) is 6 (found in the row labeled \"total\").\n\n4. Determine whether North America accounted for half of the medal wins at the 2012 game in football: Half of 6 would be 3.
