Identify the column that contains the surface type of each championship. In this case, it's the \"surface\" column.\n3. Filter the data to only include the rows where the surface is grass. Using the `filter()` function in JavaScript, we can achieve this by checking if the value in the \"surface\" column is 'grass'.\n4. Count the number of rows where the surface is grass. In this case, there are 3 such rows (rows with indexes 8, 9, and 10).\n5. Calculate the percentage of championships that have a grass surface by dividing the count of grass surfaces by the total number of championships and multiplying the result by 100%.\n\nNow, let's output the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the total number of rows (championships).\",\n    \"Identify the 'surface' column.\",\n    \"Filter the data to only include championships with a grass surface.\",\n    \"Count the number of grass surfaces and calculate its percentage.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"surface\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"surface\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"surface\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the claim is TRUE because 3 out of 14 championships (21.43%) have a grass surface.",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify all instances where Yevgeny Kafelnikov was an opponent, as the question asks for the number of matches.\n2. Count the number of times Yevgeny Kafelnikov appears in the 'opponent in the final' column.\n3. Check if this count is equal to 1 or more (since the claim mentions \"tie for the most common opponent with 2 matches\", but we don't have any information about other opponents).\n\nThe final answer will be TRUE only if there are at least 2 instances where Yevgeny Kafelnikov was an opponent.\n\nNow, let's analyze the data:\n- To find all instances of Yevgeny Kafelnikov as an opponent, we look for rows where the 'opponent in the final' value is equal to \"Yevgeny kafelnikov\".\n- There are 2 such rows, at indexes 4 and 9.\n\nSince there are exactly 2 instances of Yevgeny Kafelnikov as an opponent, the claim can be considered TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all rows where the 'opponent in the final' column is equal to 'Yevgeny kafelnikov'.\",\n    \"Count the number of such rows.\",\n    \"Check if this count is greater than or equal to 2.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
