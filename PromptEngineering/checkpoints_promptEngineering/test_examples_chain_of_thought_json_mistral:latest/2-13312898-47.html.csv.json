    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the columns of interest: \"round\", \"pick\", and \"overall\". These columns will be used to compare with the given claim.\n2. Find the row corresponding to Edgerrin James in the data array by matching his name with the \"name\" column. In this case, the relevant row is the first one as Edgerrin James' details are present there.\n3. Extract the values of the columns \"round\", \"pick\", and \"overall\" from the found row for Edgerrin James. The extracted values are 1 (round), 4 (pick), and 4 (overall).\n4. Compare the extracted values with the given claim: \"edgerrin james be the number 4 pick in the first round and number 4 overall\".\n5. If both the pick and overall values match with the given claim, then the answer is TRUE. If not, the answer is FALSE.\n\n   Here's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find columns of interest\",\n    \"Find Edgerrin James row\",\n    \"Extract 'round', 'pick', and 'overall' values for Edgerrin James\",\n    \"Compare the extracted values with the given claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
