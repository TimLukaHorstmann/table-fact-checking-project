Scroll through the rows of data to find the row associated with Brian Rafuse, as indicated by the \"locale\" column.

Understand the table structure: The table provides data about a curling competition in Canada, with each row representing a different team and columns detailing their performance metrics.\n3. Check if there's a row where stolen ends equal 5: In the given table, no row has a value of 5 for \"stolen ends\". So, we cannot directly verify or falsify the claim using the provided data.\n4. If necessary, suggest additional information: To verify this claim, we would need a complete dataset containing rows where the stolen ends are equal to 5 and the `pa` value for those specific rows. As the current table does not have such rows, I cannot provide a definitive answer.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: When stolen end equals 5, pa should be 86\",\n    \"Understand table structure: The table provides data about a curling competition with each row representing a team and columns detailing their performance metrics\",\n    \"Check if there's a row where stolen ends equal 5: No such row found in the given dataset\",\n    \"Suggest additional information: A complete dataset containing rows where stolen ends are equal to 5 would be needed to verify or falsify the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
