We only care about the \"opponent\" and \"attendance\" columns as they contain information relevant to our claim.\n\n2. Loop through the rows of data in the table and find rows where the opponent is Atlanta Falcons: In this case, we have two rows with Atlanta Falcons: row_index 5 (October 8, 1989) and row_index 19 (November 19, 1989).\n\n3. Compare the attendance for those two rows: We will compare the \"attendance\" values for row_index 5 and 19. The attendance for row_index 5 is 60488, and the attendance for row_index 19 is 53173.\n\n4. Determine whether week 8 has the largest attendance: Week 8 corresponds to row_index 5. To find out if it's the largest attendance for the Atlanta Falcons, we compare the \"attendance\" value of row_index 5 (60488) with the \"attendance\" values of all other rows where the opponent is Atlanta Falcons (row_index 19, 53173).
