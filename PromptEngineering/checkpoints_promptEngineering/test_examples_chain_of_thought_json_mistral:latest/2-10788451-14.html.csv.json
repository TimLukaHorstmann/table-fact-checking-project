For each team, find their respective row numbers in the table (Richmond's row number is 4 and Fitzroy's row number is 5).\n3. For each team, find the column that contains the away team score (column name is \"away team score\").\n4. Compare the values of the columns found in steps 2 and 3 for both teams.\n\nNow let's check the data:\n- In row 4 (Richmond), the value for the \"away team score\" column is \"11.17 (83)\".\n- In row 5 (Fitzroy), the value for the \"away team score\" column is \"11.15 (81)\".\n\nSince the values are not equal, we need to compare them further:\n- Convert both scores from goals and behinds to an integer by summing their digits (e.g., 3.2 becomes 3+2=5). For Richmond, the total is 8+3+1+7 = 19. For Fitzroy, the total is 8+1+1+5 = 15.\n- The result shows that Richmond has a higher away team score (19 > 15).\n\nFinally, let's present our answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the teams mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find their respective row numbers in the table\",\n    \"For each team, find the column that contains the away team score\",\n    \"Compare the values of the columns found for both teams\",\n    \"Convert the scores to integers by summing their digits and compare the resulting numbers\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
