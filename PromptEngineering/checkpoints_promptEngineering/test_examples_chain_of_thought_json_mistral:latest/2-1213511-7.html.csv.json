    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to determine the answer:\n\n1. Identify the key elements in the claim: The claim mentions Bemidji State University (college/junior/club team) having a Canadian player drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n2. Find all the rows that correspond to players from Bemidji State University: This involves looking for the college/junior/club team value equal to \"Bemidji State University\". In this data, there is only one such row (row index 93).\n\n3. Examine the nationality of the player in the identified row: The nationality of the player in row 93 is \"United States\", not Canada.\n\n4. Check if the player from Bemidji State University was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs: There are multiple columns (nhl team) in the table, but none of them indicate that the player from Bemidji State University was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nWith this reasoning, we can conclude that Bemidji State University did not have a Canadian player drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key elements in claim\",\n    \"Find row(s) corresponding to Bemidji State University\",\n    \"Examine nationality of player from Bemidji State University\",\n    \"Check if the player was drafted by Toronto Maple Leafs\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 93,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 93,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
