Identify the relevant columns in the table: We need to compare the \"home team\" column with \"south melborne\" for all rows.\n3. Compare each row's \"home team\" value with \"south melbourne\": For each row, check if its \"home team\" matches \"south melbourne\".\n4. Find the first match: If a row exists where the \"home team\" equals \"south melborne\", then we have found the match and can compare the away team of that row with \"fitzroy\".\n5.

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be checked, which is \"footscray be the home team when the away team score be 9.4 (58)\".\n2. Examine the structure of the table to determine which columns represent the home and away teams, their scores, and other details. The relevant columns are: home team, away team, home team score, and away team score.\n3. Iterate through each row in the data array to find a match for the condition specified in the claim. In this case, we need to find a row where the away team score is 9.4 (58) and the home team value should be \"footscray\".\n4. Find the appropriate row based on the conditions:\n   - First, filter the data array to only include rows where the away team score equals 9.4 (58). In this case, there are no such rows in the table.\n   - Since we didn't find any matches for the specified condition, it means that \"footscray\" was not the home team when the away team scored 9.4 (58).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Understand table structure\", \"Iterate through each row to find a match for the condition in the claim\", \"Check if the home team is 'footscray' and away team score is 9.4 (58)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
