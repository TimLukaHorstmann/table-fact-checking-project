    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there is more than 12.42 million viewers for an entry with a rating/share of 3.2 / 8.\n2. Understand the table structure: The table contains data about various shows, with columns \"rating\", \"share\", \"rating / share (18 - 49)\", \"viewers (millions)\", and \"rank (overall)\".\n3. Search for relevant rows: Look through the \"data\" array to find entries where the \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" is equal to \"3.2 / 8\".\n4. Check if any row matches: If a matching row is found, then check its \"viewers (millions)\" value. If it's greater than 12.42 million, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n5. Check for relevant cells: To verify the reasoning process, identify the relevant cells that were used in the analysis.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand table structure\",\n    \"Search for relevant rows based on 'rating / share (18 - 49)',\",\n    \"Check if any row matches and verify its 'viewers (millions)' value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"rating / share (18 - 49)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
