To check if the total Brazilian population for age 15-17 is 10357874, we need to find the corresponding cell in the table.\n3. In the table, the age groups are represented horizontally (columns) and the number of rows represents different data points within those age groups. The age group 15-17 corresponds to the second column from the left, labeled as \"Age\".\n4. To find the total population for this age group, we need to look for a row that has \"Age\" as its label and then check its corresponding value in the table.\n5. In the given table, the first row corresponds to the headers of each column. The second row doesn't have an \"Age\" header, so we continue scrolling down to find it.\n6. Upon checking the rows, we find the relevant data point for age 15-17 in the fourth row with a value of 10357874.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Age\"}]",
