To find the largest point gap during the season, we need to compare the point gaps of all teams on their respective matchdays (since the table shows games between these teams).\n\n4. For each comparison:\n   - Calculate the point gaps for both teams involved in the comparison.\n   - If the absolute difference between these point gaps is 0, it indicates a tie for the largest point gap.\n\n5. Check if there are any instances where the absolute difference between the point gaps of two teams on their respective matchdays is 0.\n\nThe final answer will be based on the result of this comparison:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant column (record) and calculate the win, loss, overtime loss, and tie counts from each team's record.\",\n    \"Calculate the point gap for each team as (wins - losses - 0.5 * overtime losses).\",\n    \"Compare the point gaps of teams on their respective matchdays to find instances where the absolute difference between the point gaps is 0, which indicates a tie for the largest point gap.\",\n    \"Check if there are any such instances.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    // ... for each row in the table where comparison is made\n  ]\n}",
