Then, we focus on the column of interest, which is \"avg start\". We will compare the values in this column for both years to determine if the average start in 2010 is 1.4 lower than in 2011.\n5. In the given table, the value of \"avg start\" for 2010 is 4.7 and for 2011 is 3.3.\n6. To compare these values, we first need to ensure that they are in the same units. Since both numbers are whole numbers and neither of them has a decimal point, it seems reasonable to assume that these units represent positions or ranks rather than seconds or some other metric.\n7. Now we perform the comparison: 4.7 (2010) - 3.3 (2011) = 1.4.
