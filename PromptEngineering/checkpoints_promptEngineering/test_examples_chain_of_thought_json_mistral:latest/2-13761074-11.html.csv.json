This column contains the score for each game, which is in a \"home\" team vs. \"visitor\" team format (e.g., \"92 - 95\").\n\n2. For each row, extract the first value of the score column, representing the home team's points, and check if it's equal to or greater than 100.\n\n3. Count the number of rows where the home team scored 100 or more points.\n\nUsing these steps with the given table, let's find out if Cleveland scored 100 or more points in 9 games:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check each row (game) in the 'data' array to find the 'score' column.\",\n    \"Extract the first value of the score column for each game, representing the home team's points.\",\n    \"Count the number of rows where the home team scored 100 or more points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the provided table, Cleveland scored 100 or more points in games 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. Therefore, they have scored 100 or more points in 9 games.",

Iterate through each row (game) in the data array. For each row, extract the value of the \"attendance\" column.\n3. Compare the extracted values with the threshold of 20000 to check if it is greater than or equal to 20000 for every game.\n4.
