Identify the claim: The claim states that in the 1987-88 season, Newell's Old Boys scored 55 points.\n\n3. Find the relevant data for Newell's Old Boys: Loop through each row in the table and find the one with the 'team' column value of \"newell 's old boys\".\n\n4. Check if there is a corresponding season for 1987-88: The table contains seasons represented by columns labeled with years (e.g., \"1986 - 87\", \"1987 - 88\", \"1988 - 89\"). Compare the year associated with the row found in step 3 to the desired season (1987-88).\n\n5. Check the points column for the corresponding season: If the found row corresponds to the desired season, compare the value in the 'points' column with 55.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to answer the claim:\n\n1. Identify the variables in the claim: The claim refers to three variables - points, played, and 1987-88.\n2. Locate the relevant data: In the table, we see that \"points\" correspond to the third column, \"played\" is not directly provided, but we can calculate it by subtracting the number of seasons from the total number of rows (since all teams have played 3 seasons), and 1987-88 corresponds to the fourth column in the table.\n3. Check the condition: To check if a team had played when points were 107 and 1987-88 was 31, we will iterate through each row (team) and check if the points and 1987-88 values meet the conditions. We calculate \"played\" as 3 (total seasons) - row_index + 1.\n4.
