Check if the claim provided matches any of the events listed in the \"event\" column. In this case, the claim is about the Brighton Hotel Bombing.\n3. Search for the row in the table where the \"event\" column matches \"brighton hotel bombing\".\n4. If a matching row is found, check if the \"location\" column of that row also matches \"brighton, uk\".\n5. If both the event name and its location match, it means the claim is true.
