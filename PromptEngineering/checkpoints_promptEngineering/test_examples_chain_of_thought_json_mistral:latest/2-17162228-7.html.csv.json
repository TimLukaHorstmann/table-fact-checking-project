    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column that represents the place: The table provides a list of columns, and we can see that one of them is \"place\". This column will help us determine the ranking of each player.\n\n2. Filter data based on the 'place' column: To check if there's a first-place tie, we need to find out who has the lowest score. We'll do this by iterating through the rows where the 'place' column is either not defined or equal to an empty string (indicating no rank), as those are likely the players with the best scores.\n\n3. Compare scores of relevant players: After filtering, we compare the scores (in the \"score\" column) of duffy waldorf, jeff sluman, and frank nobilo to determine if they have the same score. If their scores are equal, then the claim is true.\n\n4. Determine the tie breaker (if necessary): In case there's a tie in score, we can check for other factors like the 'to par' column or the 'money' column to decide the winner. However, since all three players have the same score (-1), we don't need to consider these columns.\n\n5. Output the answer: Based on our analysis, if the scores of duffy waldorf, jeff sluman, and frank nobilo are equal, then there is a first-place tie between them.\n\n   Final Answer in JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the 'place' column\",\n       \"Filter rows where place is either not defined or empty string\",\n       \"Compare scores of duffy waldorf, jeff sluman, and frank nobilo\",\n       \"If scores are equal, there's a first-place tie\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n     ]\n   }",
