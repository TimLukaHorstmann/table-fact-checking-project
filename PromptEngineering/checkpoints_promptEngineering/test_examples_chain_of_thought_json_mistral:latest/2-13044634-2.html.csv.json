We see that four of these games took place in Hammond, Indiana (as specified by the \"location\" column).\n\n3.

Determine the relevant data: To check if a game lasted 5 minutes, we need to look for entries where the opponent is LC Davis and the time column indicates 5 minutes.\n3. Examine the table: Looking through the table, we don't see any row where both the opponent's name is LC Davis and the time is exactly 5 minutes. However, we can notice that times in the table are given in a format like \"2:26\" or \"5:00\", which represents hours and minutes. Since the claim doesn't specify that it should be exact to seconds, let's consider 5 minutes as an approximation for times like 5:00 (which is clearly 5 minutes) or anything larger than 4:XX (since 4 minutes and above are close to 5 minutes).\n4.
