The table has five columns - 'week', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', and 'attendance'.\n\n3. Iterate through each row in the 'data' array to find a match for the given date.\n\n4. Compare the 'date' value of each row with the given claim's date (October 16, 1983). If there is a match, then it indicates that the opponent on October 16, 1983, was indeed the Chicago Bears.\n\n5.
