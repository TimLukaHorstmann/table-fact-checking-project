In this case, it's Miami (row 7, 7)\n2. Find all rows where the team is Miami and check for rows where either Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy have a value in the \"rebound\" column.\n3. Compare the maximum rebound found with the other rows to determine if it's the highest.\n\nThe final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team against which we need to find the highest rebound\",\n    \"Find all rows where the team is the specified one and check for rows where either Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy have a value in the 'rebound' column.\",\n    \"Compare the maximum rebound found with the other rows to determine if it's the highest.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"rebound\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 81,\n      \"column_name\": \"rebound\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds against Miami (row 7), and the highest rebound by Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy is indeed 14.
