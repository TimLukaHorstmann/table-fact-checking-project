    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team we are looking for: \"cup noodle - honda\".\n2. Find the rows where the \"team\" column matches the desired team.\n3. Check if there is more than one row matching the team to ensure it is not the only one with \"nsr250\".\n4. For each row of the team, check the \"points\" column to see if any value is less than 8.\n5. If there exists a row where the \"team\" is \"cup noodle - honda\" and the \"points\" are less than 8, then the claim is TRUE. If not, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's check the table based on these steps:\n\n1. We find two rows with the team \"cup noodle - honda\".\n2. There are only two rows, so we don't need to worry about multiple matches for now.\n3. For each row (let's call them R1 and R2):\n   - Row R1: The points are 8, which is not less than 8.\n   - Row R2: The points are 11, which is also not less than 8.\n4. None of the rows have points less than 8.\n\nSince none of the rows meet the condition of having fewer than 8 points with \"nsr250\", the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify team: cup noodle - honda\",\n    \"Find rows where 'team' matches the desired team\",\n    \"Check if there is more than one row matching the team to ensure it is not the only one with nsr250\",\n    \"For each row of the team, check the 'points' column to see if any value is less than 8\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
