For Phil Mickelson, there are two instances, while for Zach Johnson, there is only one instance.\n3.

Compare the number of years that each player has won within the given table to determine who has won more times. In this case, Phil Mickelson has won in two different years (2004 and 2006), while Zach Johnson has only won once (in 2007).\n6.
