    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The claim states that Tomasz Sikora participated in the 1994 Lillehammer event and came in 32nd at the sprint.\n\n2. Extract the relevant data from the table: The data for each individual event is located in the \"data\" array of the JSON object, with each row representing a different event. We need to find the row that corresponds to the 1994 Lillehammer event.\n\n3. Check if there's an entry for an individual in the table: The first column represents the individual participant, and since we don't know who Tomasz Sikora is in this context, we can't directly search for his name. However, if there is no individual specified in any of the rows, it means that event was not participated by an individual.\n\n4. Find the row related to the 1994 Lillehammer event: The second element in each sub-array corresponds to the event, so we need to find a sub-array with the second element equal to \"1994 lillehammer\".\n\n5. Check if the sprint column has any value: If the value in the sprint column of the row related to the 1994 Lillehammer event is not empty, it means that an individual participated in the sprint event of that year's Olympics.\n\n6. Compare the position of Tomasz Sikora: If the value in the sprint column is a number, we need to check if it matches the position stated in the claim (32nd). If it does, then the claim is true; otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's check the table according to our reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, identify the claim: The claim is that Tomasz Sikora participated in the 1994 Lillehammer event and came in 32nd at the sprint.\n\n2. Extract the relevant data: To find the row related to the 1994 Lillehammer event, we need to look for a sub-array with the second element equal to \"1994 lillehammer\". The third row meets this condition.\n\n3. Check if there's an entry for an individual in the table: In our case, the individual column is empty, meaning that no individual data was provided for any of the events in the given table.\n\n4. Find the row related to the 1994 Lillehammer event: The third row corresponds to the 1994 Lillehammer event.\n\n5. Check if the sprint column has any value: The third row's sprint column contains a number (32nd).\n\n6. Compare the position of Tomasz Sikora: Since we don't have any information about Tomasz Sikora in this table, it's impossible to compare his position with the one provided in the claim. As a result, we can only say that we cannot verify the claim based on the given data.\n\nFinal answer (with JSON format):\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Extract the relevant data from the table\",\n    \"Check if there's an entry for an individual in the table\",\n    \"Find the row related to the 1994 Lillehammer event\",\n    \"Check if the sprint column has any value\",\n    \"Compare the position of Tomasz Sikora\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"UNABLE_TO_VERIFY\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"individual\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"sprint\" }\n  ]\n}",
