Count the number of rows (tournaments) with wins equal to 3: There are no rows (tournaments) in the table where wins equal 3, so the claim about Ian Poulter winning a tournament 3 times is false.\n4. Count the total number of events where players made a cut: Sum up the \"cuts made\" column from all rows (events). In this case, it's 35 + 10 + 13 + 12 + 10 = 70.
