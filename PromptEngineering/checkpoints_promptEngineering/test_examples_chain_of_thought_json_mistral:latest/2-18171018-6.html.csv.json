    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that player Gil Morgan represents the United States and ties for 7th place with -2 to par.\n\n2. Identify the relevant data in the table: To verify this claim, we need to find the row corresponding to player Gil Morgan and check if he is from the United States, his total score is less than or equal to the lowest score among the top 7 players (since they are tied), and his \"to par\" value is -2.\n\n3. Find the row for player Gil Morgan: Scan through the data array and find the row where the \"player\" column matches \"gil morgan\". In this case, it's at index 10 (indexes start from 0).\n\n4. Check if player Gil Morgan is from the United States: In the same row, check the value of the \"country\" column. If it's \"united states\", then he represents the United States as per the claim.\n\n5. Check if player Gil Morgan ties for 7th place: Compare his total score (calculate by converting the \"score\" value from string to number) with the scores of the top 7 players, and check if their \"to par\" values are -2. If he is among the top 7 players with a \"-2 to par\", then he ties for 7th place as per the claim.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the relevant data\",\n    \"Find the row for player Gil Morgan\",\n    \"Check if player Gil Morgan is from the United States\",\n    \"Check if player Gil Morgan ties for 7th place\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    // ... top 7 players' rows for score and to par comparison\n  ]\n}",
