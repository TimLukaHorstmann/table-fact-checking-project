The order of the teams in the data array does not matter, but they must be listed in the same order as in the claim.\n3. For each row, compare the values in the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns with Sydney FC and Perth Glory respectively. If both values match the claimed teams, proceed to the next step.\n4. Check the value in the \"score\" column of the matched row. Determine if the score for Perth Glory is greater than or equal to the score for Sydney FC. If yes, then the claim is FALSE as Perth did not lose to Sydney. If no, proceed to the next step.\n5. The claim is TRUE if all the above steps have been completed and the score for Sydney FC is greater than the score for Perth Glory in the matched row.\n\nFinally, the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams involved in the claim\",\n    \"Iterate through each row of the table to find a match between these two teams as home and away respectively\",\n    \"For each row, compare the values in the 'home team' and 'away team' columns with Sydney FC and Perth Glory respectively\",\n    \"Check the value in the 'score' column of the matched row.
