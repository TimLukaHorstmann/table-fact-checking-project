    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The claim is \"prince park be home to the carlton team\".\n2. Understand the structure of the table: The table consists of two parts - \"columns\" which define the headers, and \"data\", which contains the rows of data. Each row represents a different event, with each cell in the row corresponding to one column.\n3. Locate the relevant cells in the table: To determine if Prince Park is home to the Carlton team, we need to find rows where the venue is Prince Park and the home team is Carlton.\n4. Extract the data from the relevant cells: Since we are interested in the venue and home team columns, we will focus on the \"venue\" and \"home team\" values in each row of the table.\n5. Compare the extracted data: If we find a row where both the venue is Prince Park and the home team is Carlton, then it can be concluded that Prince Park is home to the Carlton team.\n6. Evaluate the comparison results: By examining the data in the table, we see that there is one row where the venue is Prince Park (row index 2). The home team for this event is \"carlton\". Thus, Prince Park is home to the Carlton team.\n\n   Final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Understand table structure\",\n    \"Locate relevant cells\",\n    \"Extract data from relevant cells\",\n    \"Compare extracted data\",\n    \"Evaluate comparison results\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
