In this table, the \"date\" column provides the date of each game, so we'll check that the date for every row is in October 1967. The format of dates in the table is \"MM/DD, YYYY\". We can convert it to a standard date format and compare if it falls within October 1967.\n\n2. Next, we'll loop through each row and check if the result column indicates a loss. In this table, the \"result\" column shows the outcome of each game as a string in the format \"w X - Y\", where \"X\" is the score for the team playing at home (if applicable), \"Y\" is the score for the opponent, and the first letter indicates whether it was a win (W) or loss (L). If the first letter is 'L', then that row represents a loss.\n\n3. Based on the results of steps 1 and 2, we'll determine if there were any losses in October 1967. If none of the rows where the date is in October 1967 have a 'L' as the first letter in the \"result\" column, then the claim that \"the colt didn't lose a game in October 1967\" is TRUE.\n\n4.
