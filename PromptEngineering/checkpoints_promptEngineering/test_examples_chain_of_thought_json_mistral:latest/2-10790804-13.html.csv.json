The table contains 6 columns (home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date) and multiple rows, each representing a match between two teams.\n\n2. We are given a claim that out of 12 teams, only Essendon and Footscray scored below 10 points in a match on August 1, 1936.\n\n3. To verify this claim, we will go through each row (match) in the table, check the home team score and away team score for that particular match on August 1, 1936. If either of these scores is less than 10 points, we add those rows to our relevant cells list.\n\n4. We then compare the number of rows (matches) with scores below 10 against the total number of matches (12).
