The \"year\" column provides the year of each match, while the \"1st leg\" column contains the score for the first game of each match.\n\n3. We iterate through each row in the \"data\" array to find a match where the \"1st leg\" value is \"4 - 1\". Since we know that the table is sorted by year, if a match with this score exists, it should be at index 2004 (as the years are sequential).\n\n4. In case we found a match in step 3, we will then confirm that the year value of that row matches the \"4 - 1\" we're looking for.\n\nThe final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year for which the 1st leg score is '4 - 1', then compare this with each row in the table to find a match.\", \"Iterate through the rows, comparing the 'year' and '1st leg' values.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\" }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the claim statement: The claim states that a 2nd leg score of \"3 - 0\" corresponds to a time when San Pedro finished as the second place winner.\n\n2. Determine relevant columns: To answer this question, we need to check if there is any row in the table where the \"winner\" column shows a different team than San Pedro (the team that didn't win) and the \"2nd leg\" score is exactly \"3 - 0\". We also need to ensure that the team which won in that particular row should be listed as the first place winner in the same year.\n\n3. Search for matching rows: Scroll through each row in the table, comparing the columns 'winner' and '2nd leg' against the claim. Check if there is a row where both conditions are met (i.e., the winner column shows a different team than San Pedro and the 2nd leg score is \"3 - 0\").\n\n4. Output the final answer: If we find such a row, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, the claim is TRUE. If there's no match found during the search, it means that San Pedro never finished second while losing the 2nd leg by a score of \"3 - 0\".\n\nRelevant cells for this question would be:\n- [relevant_cells]: [\n  { \"row_index\": <row index where we find a match>, \"column_name\": \"winner\" },\n  { \"row_index\": <row index where we find a match>, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\" }\n]\n\nSince no row matches the conditions, the final answer would be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
