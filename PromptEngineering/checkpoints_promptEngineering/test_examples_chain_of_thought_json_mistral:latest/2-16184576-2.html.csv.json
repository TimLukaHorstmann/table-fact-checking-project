    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. Check the given data to find the year for each tournament. The column name is \"year end ranking\", which contains the player's rank at the end of each year. The row indexes correspond to different tournaments, and the value in each cell represents the player's year-end ranking.\n2. To find the year for 1987, we would need to look for a year-end ranking of 824 (since this is the ranking in the row corresponding to the tournament in 1997). However, there is no such value in the given data, suggesting that the player did not play in 1987.\n3. Now, let's find the annual win-loss for 2001. In the same manner as step 1, we look for a row with \"year end ranking\" of 35 (since this is the ranking in the row corresponding to the tournament in 2001).\n4. The annual win-loss is calculated by looking at the cells under the column \"annual win - loss\". In the row corresponding to 2001, the value for annual win-loss is 9 - 7.\n5. Compare the results from steps 2 and 4. Since we found that the player did not play in 1987 (step 2), and the annual win-loss for 2001 was not 9 - 9 (step 4), our claim is false.\n\nanswer: \"FALSE\"\nrelevant_cells: [\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year end ranking\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\" }\n]",
