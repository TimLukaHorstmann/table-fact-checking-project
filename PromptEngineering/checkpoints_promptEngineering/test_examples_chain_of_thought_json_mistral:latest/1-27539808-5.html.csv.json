    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that December 4th is the date of a game with location and attendance as 'wells fargo center (19684)'.\n\n2. Verify the structure of the table: The table has two main sections - 'columns' which defines the headers, and 'data' which contains the rows of data. Each row corresponds to a single game.\n\n3. Look for the relevant column names in the table: We are searching for columns named 'game', 'december', 'location / attendance'. All of these exist in the table structure.\n\n4. Check if all necessary values can be extracted from each row: For each row, we need to check if it contains data for 'game', 'december', and 'location / attendance'. If all three pieces of information are present, then we can evaluate the claim based on the 'location / attendance' value.\n\n5. Loop through the rows in the table and compare the values: Starting from the first row (row_index=0), check if the 'game', 'december', and 'location / attendance' match the claim. If a matching row is found, it means that December 4th was the date of the game at Wells Fargo Center with 19684 in attendance.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Verify the table structure\",\n    \"Check if all relevant columns are present\",\n    \"Evaluate each row to find a match with the given conditions\",\n    \"Loop through rows and compare values\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\" }\n  ]\n}",
