    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, identify the player whose score is given in terms of total strokes (i.e., Vijay Singh).\n2. Convert Vijay Singh's total strokes to a number by evaluating the expression inside the quotes for the first row. In this case, 70 + 66 + 67 + 68 = 271.\n3. Note that Vijay Singh's \"to par\" value is 9, which means his score under par is 9 (since par in golf is usually 72).\n4. Identify the other player whose score is also given in terms of total strokes (i.e., Steve Stricker).\n5. Convert Steve Stricker's total strokes to a number by evaluating the expression inside the quotes for the second row. In this case, 69 + 68 + 66 + 70 = 273.\n6. Note that Steve Stricker's \"to par\" value is 7, which means his score under par is 5.\n7. Compare Vijay Singh's score and Steve Stricker's score. To do this, subtract the total strokes from the par for each player. In this case, Vijay Singh finished with a score of 271 - 9 = 6 under par, while Steve Stricker finished with a score of 273 - 7 = 4 under par.\n8. Determine if Vijay Singh won the tournament by checking if his score is lower than any other player's score and if it's at least one stroke better than the runner-up (Steve Stricker in this case). In our data, we can see that Vijay Singh has a lower score than Steve Stricker, so he is ahead.\n9. Check if Vijay Singh's advantage over the second-place finisher (Steve Stricker) is at least 2 strokes. In our case, the difference between their scores is 6 - 4 = 2 strokes, which satisfies the condition for winning a tournament by 2 strokes.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that Vijay Singh won the 1998 PGA Championship by finishing 9 under par and being 2 strokes ahead of Steve Stricker.
