    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there is no win when the top 25 and even the top 10 are less than 4.\n2. Check the table structure: Understand the structure of the data in the table, with the columns being \"tournament\", \"wins\", \"top - 5\", \"top - 10\", \"top - 25\", \"events\", and \"cuts made\".\n3. Find rows related to the claim: Identify the rows in the table that represent individual tournaments, as they are relevant to the claim about wins. The totals row is not relevant to the claim as it provides summary statistics.\n4. Check the top 10 and top 25 for each tournament: For each tournament, verify if the number of times a golfer finishes in the top 10 or top 25 is less than 4. In the given table, only the Masters Tournament has a golfer finishing in the top 25 less than 4 times (4 times).\n5. Check the wins for each tournament: For each tournament where the top 10 or top 25 is less than 4, verify if there are any wins. In this case, the Masters Tournament is the only tournament where the top 25 is less than 4, and it has 0 wins.\n6. Compare the findings: Based on the previous steps, determine if there is a win when the top 10 or top 25 is less than 4. In this case, there are no tournaments with wins and a top 10 or top 25 less than 4.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Check the table structure\", \"Find rows related to the claim\", \"Check the top 10 and top 25 for each tournament\", \"Check the wins for each tournament\", \"Compare the findings\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim conditions: The claim states that for the PGA Championship, if the number of times top - 25 is less than 4 (top_25_less_than_4), there should be 0 wins (wins_equal_0), with cuts made equal to 6 (cuts_made_equal_to_6) and top - 5 greater than 0 (top_5_greater_than_0).\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to the PGA Championship in the data: We need to find a row where the tournament column matches \"pga championship\". Let's assume the row index is 4.\n\n3. Check if top - 25 is less than 4 for the PGA Championship: Look at the value in the top_25 column of the PGA Championship row (top_25[4]). If it is less than 4, then top_25_less_than_4 is true.\n\n4. Check if wins are equal to 0 for the PGA Championship: Look at the value in the wins column of the PGA Championship row (wins[4]). If it is 0, then wins_equal_to_0 is true.\n\n5. Check if cuts made are equal to 6 for the PGA Championship: Look at the value in the cuts made column of the PGA Championship row (cuts_made[4]). If it is 6, then cuts_made_equal_to_6 is true.\n\n6. Check if top - 5 is greater than 0 for the PGA Championship: Look at the value in the top - 5 column of the PGA Championship row (top_5[4]). If it is greater than 0, then top_5_greater_than_0 is true.\n\n7. Evaluate if the conditions meet the claim: Combine the results of steps 3 to 6 to see if they satisfy the conditions stated in the claim. If all are true, then the claim is valid.\n\nThe final answer will be based on the result of step 7.\n\nHere's the output JSON:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim conditions: wins_equal_0, top_25_less_than_4, cuts_made_equal_to_6, and top_5_greater_than_0 for PGA Championship\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the PGA Championship in the data\",\n    \"Check if top - 25 is less than 4 for the PGA Championship (top_25[4])\",\n    \"Check if wins are equal to 0 for the PGA Championship (wins[4])\",\n    \"Check if cuts made are equal to 6 for the PGA Championship (cuts_made[4])\",\n    \"Check if top - 5 is greater than 0 for the PGA Championship (top_5[4])\",\n    \"Evaluate if the conditions meet the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"top_25\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\" }\n  ]\n}",
