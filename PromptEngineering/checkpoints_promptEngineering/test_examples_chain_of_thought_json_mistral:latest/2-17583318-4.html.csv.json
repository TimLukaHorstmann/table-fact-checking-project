    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there is no team (in this case, player) with less than 10 appearances at UEFA cup and less than 4 at the League Cup.\n\n2. Understand the structure of the table: We are given a table with six columns (player, position, premier league, fa cup, league cup, uefa cup, total) and five rows (Michael Dawson, Paul Robinson, Pascal Chimbonda, Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane).\n\n3. Create a condition for the claim: Since we are checking for no team having less than 10 UEFA cup appearances and less than 4 League Cup appearances, this translates to all teams having at least 10 UEFA cup appearances OR at least 4 League Cup appearances.\n\n4. Check each row in the table against the condition: For each player, we'll compare their UEFA cup and League cup values with the specified minimums.\n\n5. Output the answer based on the checking: If all players meet the conditions, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim: no team has less than 10 UEFA cup appearances and less than 4 League Cup appearances\", \"Understand table structure: six columns and five rows\", \"Create a condition for the claim: all teams having at least 10 UEFA cup appearances OR at least 4 League Cup appearances\", \"Check each row in the table against the condition\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\" }\n  ]\n}",
