Check if the table contains data for the specified \"northampton\" parish: Yes, the table does contain data for the \"northampton\" parish.\n3. Verify the area for the \"northampton\" parish: The area for the \"northampton\" parish is given as 243.31 km\u00b2.\n4. Verify the census ranking for the \"northampton\" parish: The census ranking for the \"northampton\" parish is given as \"1537 of 5008\".\n5.

Compare the extracted areas with the value 200 (which represents the area smaller than 200 km\u00b2). Since none of the areas are less than 200 km\u00b2, it implies that none of the parishes whose census ranking is in question meet the criteria of having an area smaller than 200 km\u00b2.\n4. Because none of these parishes have an area smaller than 200 km\u00b2, their census rankings cannot be among the rankings for the parish with an area smaller than 200 km\u00b2.\n5.
