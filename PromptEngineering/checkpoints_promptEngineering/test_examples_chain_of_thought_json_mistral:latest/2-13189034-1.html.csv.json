Each row represents an individual episode with details about the month & year, title, vehicles involved, backup vehicle (if any), and budget.\n\n2. Find the relevant row: We need to locate the row that corresponds to the given episode details - July 2007, Series 9, Episode 7. By looking at the data array, we find the matching row with a \"july 2007\" value in the first column and \"series 9 , episode 7\" in the second column. The relevant row index is 2.\n\n3. Check the relevant column: In this case, we are interested in checking whether a vehicle other than a motorized one was used (specifically, a dogsled). We find the \"hammond 's vehicle\", \"clarkson 's vehicle\", and \"may 's vehicle\" columns to check if they contain any vehicles.\n\n4. Confirm the result: In the third row of the data array, we see that the value for \"hammond's vehicle\" is \"dogsled (with matty mcnair)\". This confirms that a non-motorized vehicle was indeed used in the given episode.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Find relevant row based on episode details\",\n    \"Check relevant column for vehicle information\",\n    \"Confirm result by checking if a non-motorized vehicle was used\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"hammond 's vehicle\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
