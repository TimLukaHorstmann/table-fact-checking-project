In this case, we will assume that the data corresponds to a different major party.\n\n4. Find the relevant cells: To compare the number of votes between 1993 and 1984, look for the row indices corresponding to these years and find the columns containing total votes (column name: \"of total votes\").\n\n5. Compare the values: Compare the values in the \"of total votes\" column for the rows representing 1993 and 1984.
