Check the table to find games where Andray Blatche or Javale McGee scored 20 points, as that would meet the condition for tying for game high points.\n2. Scan the \"data\" array in the provided JSON object to locate rows with the names of either Andray Blatche or Javale McGee in the \"high points\" column and a value of 20 in that same column.\n3. If I find any such rows, then those games are where they tied for game high point. In these rows, take note of their row indices as we will need them later.\n4. Check if both found rows have the \"location\" value of \"detroit\", which is a requirement stated in the claim. This will ensure that both tied games were against Detroit.\n5.

Now, let's check if both of these games were against Detroit by looking at the \"location\" values for each game: row_index 11 is against Houston, so it doesn't match the requirement; however, row_index 12 is indeed against Detroit.\n4.

Next, I need to identify which row in the data matches the given claim \"the score be 98 - 91 in overtime when gilbert arenas al thornton score the highest point with 20\".
