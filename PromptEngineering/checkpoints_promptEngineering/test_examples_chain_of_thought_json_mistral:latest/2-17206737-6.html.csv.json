    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the team in question which is Montreal Canadiens. This can be done by checking for rows where the 'home' column value is equal to \"montreal canadiens\".\n\n2. Next, we need to find out if there are any instances where the 'visitor' column value is also \"montreal canadiens\", which would contradict the claim. This would help us eliminate potential false positives.\n\n3. Then, we need to check if there are any dates (as represented by the 'date' column) for Montreal Canadiens on December 27, 29, and 30. This will help us verify whether they were indeed visitors on those specific dates.\n\n4. Finally, we compare the dates found in step 3 with the home/visitor status to confirm if Montreal Canadiens were the visitor on those particular days (December 27, 29, and 30).\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n1. To identify the Montreal Canadiens rows, we would check row_index: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The column_name is \"home\".\n2. To check if Montreal Canadiens were ever the home team, we would check row_index: [0] with column_name \"visitor\".\n3. To find the dates for Montreal Canadiens, we look at the 'date' column in rows where they are the home team (step 1).\n\nAfter verifying the above steps, we can see that on December 27, 29, and 30, Montreal Canadiens were indeed the away team. Therefore, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify Montreal Canadiens rows, 2. Check if Montreal Canadiens are ever home team, 3. Find dates for Montreal Canadiens, and 4.

This will give us the total number of games played by the Montreal Canadiens during this period. In this case, there are 13 games.\n\n2. Check each row to find out the attendance for that game. The relevant column here is \"attendance\". If the value in a given row (for the \"attendance\" column) is less than 17132, then it meets our criteria of having an attendance of less than 17132.\n\n3.
