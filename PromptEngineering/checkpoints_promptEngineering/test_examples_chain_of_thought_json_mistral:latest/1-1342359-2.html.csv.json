This can be done by iterating through each row of the \"data\" array in the table.\n\n2. To do this, I will use the column index for the \"first elected\" column (index 3). By comparing each value at that index with the others, I can find the most recent year.\n\n3. After identifying the most recent year of first election, I will compare it to the year 1928.

    "resp": "1. Identify the data structure: The given table is a JSON object where the keys are column names and the values are either the column headers or an array of row data.\n\n2. Extract relevant columns: From the table, we can see that the columns of interest for determining whether someone was elected for the first time in 1928 are \"district\" (to ensure we're looking at the correct district), \"first elected\", and \"year\" (implicitly found from the \"result\" column since \"re - elected\" implies a previous election).\n\n3. Iterate through rows: For each row in the data array, compare its values for the \"district\" and \"first elected\" columns with the district of interest (alabama 5) and the year of interest (1928). If both conditions are met, check whether the value of the \"result\" column for that row is different from \"re - elected\".\n\n4. Output the answer: If we find a row where the district is alabama 5, the first elected is not 1928, and the result is not \"re - elected\", then our claim would be FALSE since someone was elected before 1928 in that district. Otherwise, if none of those conditions are met or if we exhaust all rows without finding a match, our claim would be TRUE since no one was elected in alabama 5 for the first time in 1928.\n\n5.
