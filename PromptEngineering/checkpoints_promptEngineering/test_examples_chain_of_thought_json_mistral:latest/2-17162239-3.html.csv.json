Extract relevant columns: In the table, we're interested in the 'player' and 'country' columns as they pertain to the player's name and country respectively. The 'score' column is also relevant but we already know the score (66) from the claim.\n\n3. Check each row for the required criteria: We need to find a row where both the 'player' matches \"scott hoch\" and the 'country' matches \"united states\".\n\n4. Compare the found rows with the claim: If we find such a row, then it proves that \"scott hoch has a score of 66, and is from the United States\".\n\n5. Search through the data: We can see that there are multiple rows in the 'data' array, so we loop through each one to check if the player name and country match our target (\"scott hoch\", \"united states\").\n\nNow, let me present the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Extract relevant columns\", \"Check each row for the required criteria\", \"Compare the found rows with the claim\", \"Search through the data\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Recognize that we need to focus on the \"player\" and \"country\" columns as they are relevant to the claim.\n3. Look for rows where the player is \"scott hoch\". There are three such rows in the table (row indices 0, 1, and 2).\n4. Check the country column for each of these rows to see if it contains \"united states\". In this case, all three rows have \"united states\" as the value for the country column.\n5. Compare the score of \"scott hoch\" with 66, which is the critical value in the claim. The score of \"scott hoch\" in each row (66) is equal to or greater than 66.\n6.

The \"place\" column will help us determine the ranking of the players, while the \"player\", \"score\", and \"to par\" columns are essential for verifying if they meet the given condition.\n\n2. Sort the data based on the \"score\" column in ascending order (least to greatest) since we're trying to find the players with a score less than 66. This will help us identify which rows contain the players who are under t4 place (since scores lower than the other listed scores will be towards the top of the sorted data).\n\n3. Check each row starting from the top (rows with the lowest scores) to see if either player \"lee janzen\" or \"craig stadler\" appears and if their \"place\" value is t4 or lower. If we find a match, then the claim is true because both players meet the condition of being under t4 place with a score less than 66.\n\n4. Continue checking each row in the sorted data until either we find a match for both players or we reach the end of the table without finding any matches.
