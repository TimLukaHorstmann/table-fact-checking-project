If it's 9 or equal to any of the rows with a rank of 9 and the same total medals, then the claim is true.\n\n3. Compare the row where nation is \"dario cologna ( sui )\" with all other rows that have a rank of 9.

Compare the total medals for Dario Cologna (2) with the total medals for all other athletes at rank 9: \"dario cologna ( sui )\" has a total of 2 medals and so do the other athletes at rank 9. Hence, they share the same total number of medals.\n\n6. Finally, verify that Dario Cologna shares the same row index with any of the athletes at rank 9. In this case, he doesn't, which means that although they have the same total number of medals, they are not in the same position in the table (i.e., tied).
