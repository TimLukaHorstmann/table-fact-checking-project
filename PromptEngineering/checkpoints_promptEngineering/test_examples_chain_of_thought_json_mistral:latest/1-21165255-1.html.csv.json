In this case, it's 4300062 (found in the \"production code\" column), corresponding to the 62nd row.\n\n2. Look at the columns of the table and focus on the column named \"no in season\". This will give us the episode's season number.\n\n3. Check the value in the \"no in season\" column for the 62nd row.\n\n4. Compare the obtained value with the given claim, which is \"19\".\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the production code from the claim (4300062)\",\n    \"Find the row number corresponding to this production code (row 62)\",\n    \"Examine the 'no in season' column for the identified row (column 2)\",\n    \"Compare the obtained value with the given claim (19)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 62,\n      \"column_name\": \"no in season\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
