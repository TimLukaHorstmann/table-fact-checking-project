    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim's conditions: The claim states that \"red cliff have no bye with less than 4 loss and more than 2494 against\". In other words, we are looking for a row in the table where the team is \"red cliffs\" and has 0 byes, fewer than 4 losses, and at least 2495 opponents (since we're looking for more than 2494).\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to \"red cliffs\": In the data section of the table, find the row where the team name is \"red cliffs\". This row has a row_index of 7.\n\n3. Check the conditions: For this row (row_index = 7), check if the columns for \"byes\", \"losses\", and \"against\" match the conditions specified in the claim. In this case, the value for \"byes\" should be 0, the value for \"losses\" should be less than 4, and the value for \"against\" should be at least 2495.\n\n4. Examine the values: In our table, the team \"red cliffs\" has 0 byes (indicated by the first column value being 0), 18 losses (row_index = 7, column name = \"losses\"), and 2422 opponents against (row_index = 7, column name = \"against\").\n\n5. Compare with the claim's conditions: The team \"red cliffs\" does have 0 byes (as stated in the claim), but it has more than 4 losses (which contradicts the claim), and fewer than 2495 opponents against (also contradicting the claim).\n\n6. Final answer: Since the condition \"less than 4 loss and more than 2494 against\" is not met for the team \"red cliffs\", the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify conditions in the claim: <0 byes, <4 losses, >2494 against>\", \"Find row corresponding to 'red cliffs': row_index = 7\", \"Check conditions for row (row_index = 7): byes = 0, losses = ?, against = ?\", \"Examine values: byes = 0, losses = 18, against = 2422\", \"Compare with claim's conditions: <4 losses and >2494 against not met for 'red cliffs'\", \"Final answer: FALSE\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"byes\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"}]\n}",
