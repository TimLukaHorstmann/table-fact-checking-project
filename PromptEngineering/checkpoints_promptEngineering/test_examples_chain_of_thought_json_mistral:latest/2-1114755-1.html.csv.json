Find the row in the table that corresponds to the identified race by looking at the \"race\" column. The race details are presented row-wise in the data array of the table.\n3. Check the number of runners for the identified race by looking at the \"runners\" column in the corresponding row.\n4. Compare the number of runners with the number of runners in other races to determine if it is the lowest.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the race mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to the identified race\",\n    \"Check the number of runners for the identified race\",\n    \"Compare the number of runners with the number of runners in other races to determine if it is the lowest\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runners\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runners\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runners\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runners\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runners\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runners\" }\n  ]\n}",
