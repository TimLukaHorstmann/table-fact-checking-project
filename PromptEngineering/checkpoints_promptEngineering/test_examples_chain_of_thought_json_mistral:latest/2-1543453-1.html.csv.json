If it does, make a note of that movie and its corresponding actor's name.\n\n4. Compare actor names: For all movies where Simon Seville is present, compare the actor names to check if they are the same or different.\n\n5. Evaluate the claim: If we find at least two distinct actor names for any movie where Simon Seville appears, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n   After following these steps, here is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Define variables (movie and actor)\",\n    \"Iterate through rows to find movies with Simon Seville\",\n    \"Check if actor names are the same for each movie where Simon Seville appears\",\n    \"Evaluate if the claim is true or false based on our findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"actor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"actor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"actor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"actor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"actor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"actor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"actor\" }\n  ]\n}",
