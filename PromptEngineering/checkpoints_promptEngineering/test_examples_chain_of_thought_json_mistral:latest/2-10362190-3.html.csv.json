Check if the data table contains a row corresponding to this exact date. The date is represented as a string formatted as \"day, month dd, yyyy\". So we convert it to the required format by switching the day and month and formatting the year as 4 digits. This gives us \"12-11-1995\".\n3. Compare this date with the dates in the \"date\" column of the data table. If there is a match, then it indicates that the table contains a row corresponding to November 12, 1995.\n4. If there is a match, find the value in the \"attendance\" column for that row. This value will represent the attendance on November 12, 1995.\n5.
