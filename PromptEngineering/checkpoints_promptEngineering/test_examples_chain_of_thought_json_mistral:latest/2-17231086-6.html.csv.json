Identify the relevant rows for checking ties: All the rows where the 'place' column has a value other than 1, as Curtis Strange is in first place and cannot be tied with anyone else.\n\n4. Count the number of players from the United States among the tied positions: In this case, we have four tied positions (t6, t9). For the tied position at row index 5, there are no United States players involved. However, for the tied positions at row indices 6 and 7, both Scott Simpson and Peter Jacobsen are from the United States. At row index 10, Paul Azinger is also from the United States. For the tied positions at row indices 12 to 15, all players are from the United States but we have already counted Scott Simpson and Paul Azinger.\n\n5. Count the number of tied players who are from the United States: We found 3 tied players from the United States (Scott Simpson, Paul Azinger, and one more player from the tied position at row index 10 or 15).\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what it means for a player to score under par. In golf, par refers to the expected number of strokes a skilled golfer should take on each hole, and typically 18 holes make up a round of golf. If a player's total score is lower than the sum of all pars for 18 holes, then they have scored under par.\n\n2. Next, we will check if any players in the table have scores under par. To do this, we need to convert each player's four-round score into a single number and compare it with the par for 18 holes (in this case, 72 since it is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context).\n\n3. Then, we will count the number of players who have scores under par and determine if they are mostly from the United States. In order to do this, we need to identify all players from the United States and compare the number of those who scored under par with the total number of players from the United States.\n\n4. Finally, we will draw a conclusion based on our comparison: If the majority (more than half) of players from the United States have scores under par, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nAfter analyzing the table, let's find the relevant cells that help us answer the question:\n\n- Relevant cells: [\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n]\n\nHere's the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify what it means for a player to score under par\",\n    \"Check if any players have scores under par by comparing their total scores with the par for 18 holes\",\n    \"Count the number of players from the United States who scored under par\",\n    \"Compare the count of players from the United States who scored under par with the total number of players from the United States\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
