Compare the extracted data with the claim: The extracted year (established) is 1961 and the WIAA classification (wiaa_classification) is \"3a\", not N/A. However, since we can't determine if something is absent from the table without explicit information, we cannot definitively say that the WIAA classification is not N/A.\n\n5. Final answer: Since the claim about the year of establishment is correct, we can confirm that Mount Tahoma was established in 1961.
