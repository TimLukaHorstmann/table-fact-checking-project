Determine where the data related to 'deon kruis' is in the table: We need to find the row containing \"deon kruis\". In this table, the player name is the first element of each sub-array within the \"data\" array.\n3. Find the \"average\" column: Since we are looking for the average runs, we need to identify the corresponding cell in each row that contains the average. In this table, the average is the sixth element of each sub-array within the \"data\" array.\n4. Compare the result with the claim: Once we have found the relevant cells (i.e., the row containing 'deon kruis' and the average column for that row), compare the value in that cell with the claimed average (0.1).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find deon kruis data\",\n    \"Locate the 'average' column\",\n    \"Compare the result with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 126,\n      \"column_name\": \"average\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
