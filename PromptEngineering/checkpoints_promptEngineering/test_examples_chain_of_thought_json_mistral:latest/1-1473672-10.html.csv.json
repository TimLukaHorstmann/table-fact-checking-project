    "resp": "Here are the steps to check the claim:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that \"Rene Lambert plays right wing and was drafted with the 146th pick\".\n\n2. Find the relevant row in the table: Since the player's name (column \"player\") matches with the one in the claim, we can find the relevant row by searching for \"Rene Lambert\" in the \"data\" array. In this case, it is the third row.\n\n3. Check the column values: Now, we will check the values in the relevant row under the columns \"position\" and \"pick\". If both values match with the claim (left wing = FALSE and 146 = pick), then the claim is true.\n\n4. Verify the result: In this case, the position value is \"right wing\", and the pick value is 146. Therefore, the claim is indeed true.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: Rene Lambert plays right wing and was drafted with the 146th pick\",\n    \"Find the relevant row in the table by searching for 'Rene Lambert' in the 'player' column\",\n    \"Check the values under 'position' and 'pick' columns of the relevant row\",\n    \"Verify the result: If both values match with the claim, then the claim is true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n   1. Identify the structure of the table: The table has a header row specifying column names, followed by multiple data rows with values for each column.\n   2. Compare the claim with the table data: The claim states that there is a \"right wing\" player named \"rene lampert\" who was picked in the 145th position.\n   3. Loop through the data rows to find a match: In the given table, the third row (row_index=2) contains the values for a \"right wing\" player named \"rene lambert\", and the first value in this row is 146 which is not 145. So we move on to the next row.\n   4. Continue looping through the data rows: In the fourth row (row_index=3), we find a match for our claim as the player's position is \"centre\", but if we ignore this discrepancy for now, the rest of the values (player name, nationality, nhl team, and college / junior / club team) match with those in the claim.\n   5. Assess the discrepancy: Since the column name is \"position\" and it is not specified as \"pick\", we cannot directly confirm that this player was picked 145th. However, considering that all other values match, it's reasonable to infer that there might have been an error in the table data or the claim itself since players are typically assigned a pick number at the draft.\n   6. Final answer: It is not possible to definitively determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based solely on this information due to the discrepancy between the claimed position and the actual position listed in the table.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Compare claim with table data\",\n    \"Loop through data rows to find a match\",\n    \"Assess discrepancy between claimed and actual position\",\n    \"Final answer based on available information\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INDETERMINABLE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"right wing\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rene lambert\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"canada\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"new york islanders\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"st jerome alouettes (qmjhl)\" }\n  ]\n}",
