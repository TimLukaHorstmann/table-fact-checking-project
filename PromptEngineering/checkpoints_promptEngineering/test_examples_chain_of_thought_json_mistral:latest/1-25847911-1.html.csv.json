Compare the dates of episodes 2 and 3 to determine the difference between them. To do this, we need to convert these dates into a format that allows us to calculate the number of days between them. In this case, both dates are given as strings in \"MM DD, YYYY\" format, so we can convert them to a standardized date object (e.g., JavaScript's Date object) and calculate the time difference.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between the two dates in days. In JavaScript, this can be done by subtracting one date from another and getting the number of milliseconds difference. Then divide that value by 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 to convert it into days.\n\nNow let's calculate the difference between episodes 2 and 3:\n\n1. Convert both dates to a JavaScript Date object:\n   - For episode 2, use `new Date(\"july 15 , 2005\")`.\n   - For episode 3, use `new Date(\"july 22 , 2005\")`.\n\n2. Calculate the time difference between the two dates and convert it to days:\n\n```javascript\nconst dateDiffInDays = (a, b) => Math.abs(Math.floor((b - a) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)))\ndateDiffInDays(new Date(\"july 15 , 2005\"), new Date(\"july 22 , 2005\")) // Output: 7\n```\n\nSince the result is 7 days, episode 3 was indeed broadcast 7 days after episode 2.\n\nThe final answer can be represented as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the dates associated with each episode from the 'broadcast date' column.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference between the two dates in days.\",\n    \"Use JavaScript to convert both dates to a Date object, then calculate and convert the time difference into days.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
