The relevant columns are \"score\" and \"player\".\n2. Next, I will examine the data row by row for any ties in the score column. Since both Raymond Floyd and Steve Pate have a score of 64, they share the same position on the leaderboard.\n3. After identifying the tied players, I will determine their placing based on the \"to par\" column which indicates the number of strokes over or under par. The lower absolute value in this column represents a better performance (more under par). In this case, both Raymond Floyd and Steve Pate have a \"-7\", meaning they are 7 under par and have identical scores.\n4. Finally, I will check if there is any other player with the same score and \"to par\" value to ensure that our tied players are truly in first place. In this table, no other player shares the same score (64) and \"to par\" value (\"-7\").\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude that Raymond Floyd and Steve Pate are indeed tied for first place.\n\nHere is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: score and player\",\n    \"Examine data row by row for any ties in the score column\",\n    \"Determine placing based on 'to par' column\",\n    \"Check if there are any other players with the same score and 'to par' value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\" }\n  ]\n}",
