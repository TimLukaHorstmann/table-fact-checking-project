Iterate through each row in the table, starting from the first one (index 0) and ending when we find a row that meets the necessary conditions: For each row, check if the date matches the provided date (\"26 may 1999\"), if the competition column does not match any recognized competitions (World Cup or UEFA Championship), and if the venue name matches \"lugo, emilia - romagna\".\n3. If a row is found that meets all these conditions, it will be the one where the friendly match took place.
