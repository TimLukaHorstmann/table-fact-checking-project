We need to find the rows where the value of the \"loss\" column matches \"seo (4 - 9)\" and the \"attendance\" column matches the number provided in the claim.\n2. Examine the data: Look through each row in the table's data array, comparing it with the player we are looking for (the \"loss\" column) and the attendance number provided in the claim.\n3. Find the relevant rows: If a row contains both the desired loss value and the attendance number, mark that row as relevant. In our case, if there is a row where the \"loss\" column has the value \"seo (4 - 9)\" and the \"attendance\" column matches the number provided in the claim (14691), that row would be relevant.\n4. Check for multiple matches: If there are multiple rows that match both conditions, consider the date to ensure we have found the correct game since the table lists games played on different dates.\n5. Output the final answer: Based on our findings, determine whether the claim is true or false. If we find a row where the loss value and attendance number match, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nThe relevant cells would be as follows if there is such a matching row:\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": <the index of the relevant row>,\n      \"column_name\": \"loss\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": <the index of the relevant row>,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nUnfortunately, a quick scan through the data does not reveal a match for the provided attendance number (14691) and the loss value (\"seo (4 - 9)\").

In this context, the player's name is not explicitly mentioned but can be found by checking for rows where the 'loss' column has a value that matches the pattern \"x - 7\" (as our target loss is \"9 - 7\").\n\n2. Check if there are any games in the dataset where the opponent is \"chicago\". This information is available in the 'opponent' column.\n\n3. If there are multiple matches for both conditions, we need to find the specific game where both conditions (player loss and opponent) are met. This will be the row that has both the player's loss and the opponent as found in steps 1 and 2.\n\n4. Once we have identified the relevant row, we can check the 'attendance' column for the number of attendees. This value should match the claimed attendance of \"29 , 704\".\n\n5.
