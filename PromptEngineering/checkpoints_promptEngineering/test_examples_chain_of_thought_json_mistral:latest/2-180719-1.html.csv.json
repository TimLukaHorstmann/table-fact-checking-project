The value is 31, which matches the number mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. Identify the runner-up's row in the table. Since we don't have a specific artist or song name in the claim, we need to check all rows except the one identified for Jean-Claude Pascal (row 14). In this case, all other rows except row 14 will be considered.\n\n5. Check the value of the \"points\" column for each of the remaining rows. The runner-up's points must be less than 31.
