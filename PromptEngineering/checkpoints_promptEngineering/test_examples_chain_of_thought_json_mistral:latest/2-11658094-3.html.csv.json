    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the specific condition in the claim, which is that there exists an institution whose location was 'hickory, north carolina' at some point between 1891 and 1975.\n\n2. Iterate through each row of the data array to find a matching date range for the given years. In this table, only one institution has joined before 1976 (which is the year following 1975) and left before or during 1976: 'lenoir-ryne university'.\n\n3. Check if the location of 'lenoir-ryne university' matches the specified location in the claim. In this case, it does: 'lenoir-ryne university' is located in 'hickory, north carolina'.\n\n4. Since we found a match, confirm that the condition in the claim is met. In this case, it is.\n\nNow, let me provide the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the specific condition in the claim\",\n    \"Iterate through each row of the data array to find a matching date range for the given years\",\n    \"Check if the location of the found institution matches the specified location in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"joined\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"left\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the criteria for the claim: The claim states that we are looking for a private institution, founded in 1839 and left in 1975, which was located in Hickory, North Carolina at some point.\n2. Loop through each row of data to find matches for the given criteria.\n3. For each row, check if it is a private institution (column \"type\"), founded in 1839 (column \"founded\") and left in 1975 (column \"left\"). Additionally, verify if the location at some point was Hickory, North Carolina (column \"location\").\n4. If a match is found, output the answer as TRUE and list the relevant cells that supported this conclusion.\n5. If no match is found after checking all rows, output the answer as FALSE and mention there were no matches for the given criteria.\n\nUsing this reasoning, here's the final JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Looking for a private institution founded in 1839 and left in 1975 that was located at some point in Hickory, North Carolina.\",\n    \"Loop through each row of data to find matches for the given criteria\",\n    \"For each row, check if it is a private institution, founded in 1839 and left in 1975, and verify if the location at some point was Hickory, North Carolina\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"left\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
