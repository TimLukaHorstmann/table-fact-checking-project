    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the scores for each tie (match). The score for a tie is the difference between the goals scored by each team. In this case, we need to find the scores for ties 8 and 9.\n2. For tie 8, the teams involved are Aston Villa vs Stoke City (Row 16) and Southampton vs West Ham United (Row 20). The goal differences for these matches can be calculated as follows:\n   - Aston Villa vs Stoke City: Goals scored by Aston Villa - Goals scored by Stoke City = 1 - 0 = 1\n   - Southampton vs West Ham United: Goals scored by Southampton - Goals scored by West Ham United = 2 - 2 = 0\n   - Since there was a replay for this tie, the final score is determined by the goals scored in the replay. In the replay, West Ham United scored 3 goals while Southampton only managed to score 1 goal. The goal difference for this match becomes 3 - 1 = 2. Adding this to the initial 0 goal difference gives us a total of 2 for tie 8.\n3. For tie 9, the teams involved are Crystal Palace vs Port Vale (Row 46) and Chelsea vs Newcastle United (Row 50). The goal differences for these matches can be calculated as follows:\n   - Crystal Palace vs Port Vale: Goals scored by Crystal Palace - Goals scored by Port Vale = 0 - 0 = 0\n   - Chelsea vs Newcastle United: After the regular game, both teams had equal goals (1-1). This tie went to a penalty shootout, with Chelsea winning 4-2 on penalties. However, since penalties do not affect the goal difference in regulation time, we will consider this tie as ending in a draw after the initial 90 minutes, giving it a goal difference of 0.\n4. To compare the scores, subtract the lower score from the higher score for each tie:\n   - For tie 8: Difference = 2 - 0 = 2\n   - For tie 9: Difference = 0 - 0 = 0\n5. Compare the differences: The difference for tie 8 is greater than the difference for tie 9 (2 > 0).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the goal differences for ties 8 and 9.\",\n    \"Calculate the goal differences for each match in ties 8 and 9, considering replay goals if applicable.\",\n    \"Compare the goal differences for ties 8 and 9.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_away_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_away_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_away_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 50, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 50, \"column_name\": \"goals_scored_away_team\"}\n  ]\n}",
