Check if there are multiple countries with the same maximum number of gold medals: Since we did not find any larger number, and there is only one country (Algeria) with a 'gold' count of 9, we can conclude that Algeria has won the most gold medals in this championship.\n5. Compare the number of gold medals for the second-placed country: To check if Algeria wins the second-most gold medals, we need to find the second-highest number of gold medals.
