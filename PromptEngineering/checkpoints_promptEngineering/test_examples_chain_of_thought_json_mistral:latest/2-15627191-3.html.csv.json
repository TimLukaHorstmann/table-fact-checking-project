Then, within this filtered list, find out which rows indicate a win (\"won\") for Dylan Sprouse in the category \"favorite tv actor\" for either 2010 or 2011.\n\n3. If there are at least one such row, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n- For Dylan Sprouse to have won in 2010, we would look for a row with year=2010 and category=\"favorite tv actor\" where the result is \"won\". Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n- For Dylan Sprouse to have won in 2011, we would look for a row with year=2011 and category=\"favorite tv actor\" where the result is \"won\".
