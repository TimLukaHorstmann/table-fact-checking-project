The table consists of a list of rows, each containing an athlete's name, bodyweight, snatch, clean & jerk, total, etc.\n2. Find the relevant row in the table for the athlete whose information we are looking for. In this case, it is \"bruno brand\u00e3o (bra)\".\n3. Check if the column names match the claim. The claim mentions \"snatch\", which is one of the columns in our table.\n4. Compare the value in the \"snatch\" column of the relevant row with the given value in the claim. In this case, the snatch for Bruno Brand\u00e3o is 157.0, as per the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure\", \"Find the relevant row for 'bruno brand\u00e3o (bra)' \", \"Check if column names match the claim\", \"Compare the value in the 'snatch' column with the given value\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"snatch\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the key information required to validate the claim: The snatch value (153.0) and total bodyweight (between 104.69 and 104.71, considering decimal places).\n2. Iterate through each row in the data array of the table.\n3. For each row, check if the 'snatch' column matches the required snatch value (153.0).\n4. If a match is found, store that row index for further analysis and move to step 5. If no match is found after checking all rows, the claim is false and we can stop the process here.\n5. Check if the total bodyweight of the stored row (from step 4) matches or is very close to the required total bodyweight (104.70).\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim's conditions: The person's snatch should be 153.0 and clean & jerk should be 180.0. This person should also have a bodyweight greater than 100 kg.\n2. Look for rows in the table that match the given conditions for snatch and clean & jerk. In this case, there are no such rows because the values for these lifts are unique for each athlete.\n3. However, we notice that some athletes have missing values (represented as \"-\") for either the snatch or clean & jerk. This implies that those athletes might meet the conditions if we consider their missing values as zeros.\n4. To check if any of the athletes with missing values weigh more than 100 kg, we look for such athletes in the table.\n5. We find two such athletes: jo\u00ebl mackenzie ( cub ) and damian abbiate ( arg ). However, neither of them has a snatch of 153.0 or a clean & jerk of 180.0, even considering missing values as zeros.\n6.
