Examine the provided table and its structure, noting the column names (episode, the w\\u03bdrd, guest, introductory phrase, original airdate, production code) and data values.\n\n2. Identify the column relevant to the claim, which is \"original airdate\" as it contains the date of each episode.\n\n3. Compare the dates in the \"original airdate\" column with the claimed date (november 15).\n\n4. Find the row in the data that has the exact match with the claimed date and store its index for future reference. In this case, it would be the fourth row, as episode 796 originally aired on november 10 but the closest matching date is november 15 (episode 798).\n\n5. Identify the column relevant to the production code claim, which is \"production code\".\n\n6. Check the cell at the identified row and column intersection (4th row, 5th column) for its value.
