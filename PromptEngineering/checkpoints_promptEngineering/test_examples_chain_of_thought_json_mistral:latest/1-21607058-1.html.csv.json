From the table, the time for carl rennie is in row 13 (not exactly row 12, but it's still the 12th rider as counting starts from 0).

From the table, the speed for carl rennie is in row 13 and column \"speed\". In row 13 and column \"speed\", the value is \"126.578 mph\", which does not match the claimed speed.\n4.

    "resp": "1. Identify the rider, vehicle, and date mentioned in the claim. The rider is Ryan Farquhar, the vehicle is a 1000cc Kawasaki, and the date is Tuesday, June 2nd.\n\n2. Locate the data corresponding to this rider, vehicle, and date in the provided table. To do so, search each row for the rider's name (Ryan Farquhar), vehicle type (1000cc Kawasaki), and column headers corresponding to Tuesday, June 2nd.\n\n3. The relevant cells are as follows:\n   [\n     { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Tuesday, June 2\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Rider\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Vehicle\" }\n   ]\n\n4. Inspect the values in these cells for the relevant row (row 12) to determine if there is a time listed for Tuesday, June 2nd for Ryan Farquhar on his 1000cc Kawasaki.\n\n5. The value for the \"Tuesday, June 2\" cell (column_name: \"Tuesday, June 2\") in row 12 (row_index: 12) does not contain any time value. Therefore, there is no time listed for Tuesday, June 2nd for Ryan Farquhar on his 1000cc Kawasaki.\n\n6.
