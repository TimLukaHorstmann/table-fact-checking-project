A tie score is when both teams score the same number of goals, which is not necessarily equal to 0-0 (zero all).\n3. Iterate through each row in the table and check if any two matches have the same number of goals scored by each team (i.e., a tie score).\n4. In this case, there are six rows in the table. To find out if there are two matches with the same number of goals scored by both teams, we compare the \"score1\" values pairwise.\n\nThe reasoning process has led us to check for pairs of rows where the goal difference between the two scores is 0 (either both scores are equal or one score is higher by an arbitrary amount).\n\nAfter checking all pairs, it can be seen that no such pair exists in the table.
