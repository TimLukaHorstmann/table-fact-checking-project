    "resp": "Reasoning steps:\n1. First, identify the data structure of the table to understand how the information is organized. In this case, it's a JSON object with two main keys: \"columns\" and \"data\". The columns key contains an array of column names, while the data key contains an array of game data rows.\n2. Next, look for the relevant row number (row_index) that corresponds to the given game number in the claim (game 20). In this table, the data is a multi-dimensional array, where each inner array represents a single game. The indices of these arrays start from 0, so we need to find the index that is equal to or just greater than 19 (since game 20 should be in the 20th position).\n3. Then, check the value at column 2 (team) for the identified row number. This column contains the team names for each game, so if it matches \"LA Lakers\", then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n   Final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure (JSON with columns and data)\",\n    \"Find row number for game 20 (should be 19 or greater)\",\n    \"Check the team name in column 2 of the identified row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to follow for determining whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the team mentioned in the claim (\"LA Lakers\") in the table data.\n2. If the team exists in the data, find its row index.\n3. Compare the found row index with the number of rows in the data (6 + 1 = 7).\n4. Check if the row index is equal to 6 (the game number for which we are checking).\n\nNow let's analyze the table data to find whether \"LA Lakers\" play in Game 6:\n\n- Look for \"LA Lakers\" in the \"team\" column of the \"data\" array.\n- It can be found at row index 20.\n- Compare this with 6 (the game number we are checking).\n\nNow let's format our answer based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Search for 'LA Lakers' in the 'team' column of the 'data' array\",\n    \"Find the row index where 'LA Lakers' appears (row 20)\",\n    \"Compare the found row index with the number of rows in the data (7)\",\n    \"Check if the row index is equal to the game number (6)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the answer is \"FALSE\" because LA Lakers play in Game 6 (according to their row index), but we are checking for Game 6, and it has a different row index.",
