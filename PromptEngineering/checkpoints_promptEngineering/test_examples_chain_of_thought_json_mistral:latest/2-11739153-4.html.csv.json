After iterating through all games, compare the final maximum attendance value with the attendance of the November 24 game (row 12). If they are equal, set the answer as true; otherwise, false.\n6. Output the relevant cells for reviewing purposes to help understand the process.\n\nNow, let's present the JSON object with the final answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column containing game attendance data\",\n    \"Iterate through each row (game)\",\n    \"Initialize a variable to store the maximum attendance and its corresponding index\",\n    \"Compare the value in the 'attendance' column with the current maximum attendance for each game\",\n    \"After iterating, compare the final maximum attendance with the November 24 game's attendance\",\n    \"Output the relevant cells for reviewing purposes\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAs a final note, the November 24 game against Nashville has the highest attendance among all games listed in the provided table.",
