    "resp": "1. Identify the columns that are relevant to comparing the game between Toronto (team) and Cleveland (game). These include the 'team', 'game' (for comparison), 'date' (to ensure it matches the date specified in the claim), and 'score'.\n\n2. Iterate through the table data row by row, looking for a match where both the 'team' and 'game' match \"toronto\" and \"cleveland\" respectively.\n\n3. For each match found, check if the corresponding 'date' matches \"november 24\".\n\n4. If a match is found and the date matches, compare the 'score'. If the 'score' for Toronto (second value in the row) shows a loss, the claim is true. If the 'score' does not show a loss or no match is found, the claim is false.\n\n5. If no matches are found, it implies that there was no game between Toronto and Cleveland on November 24, so the claim can be considered false based on the given table.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns (team, game, date, score).\",\n    \"Iterate through table rows.\",\n    \"Check if row matches 'toronto' and 'cleveland'.\",\n    \"Check if the corresponding date matches 'november 24'.\",\n    \"If match found, check if Toronto shows a loss in the score.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the game we need to check, based on the date and location given in the claim (in this case, \"november 20\" and \"dallas\").\n\n2. Find the corresponding row in the data array that matches these conditions.\n\n3. Check if the \"game\", \"date\", and \"location attendance\" values in the selected row match the given date and location in the claim. If they don't, then the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. If steps 1-3 pass, check the \"score\" column to see if it matches the score given in the claim (in this case, \"w 110 - 101 (ot)\"). If it does, then the claim is TRUE.\n\n5. If steps 1-4 don't pass or there's an error during these steps, return the relevant cells as objects with their row_index and column_name so we can understand why the claim is not valid.\n\nNow, let's check the data table for the game on November 20 in Dallas:\n\n- Game on row 11 has date \"november 20\" and location \"dallas\" which doesn't match the claimed date and location.\n\nHere's the final JSON object with our reasoning and the relevant cells found during our investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the game based on the given claim date and location\", \"Find the row that matches the identified game\", \"Check if the values in the selected row match the claimed date and location\", \"Check if the score of the selected row matches the score given in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the claim is not valid because it doesn't match the game that took place on November 20 in Dallas.",
