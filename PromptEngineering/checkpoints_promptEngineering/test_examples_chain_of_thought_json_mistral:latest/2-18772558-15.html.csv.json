As mentioned earlier, there is no direct evidence of Denis Folwell playing Martha Woodford in \"One man's family.\" However, since he played Jack Archer, who was in the same series as Martha Woodford (the archers), it can be inferred that Denis Folwell might have played other characters in the \"Archers\" series.\n9.
