Extract the relevant data from the table for each row, based on the number (in this case, 32). To do this, we need to find the row where \"number\" is equal to 32. This will give us the row index.\n3. Check if the extracted row contains a memory of 24 gb qpi gt / s and a clock of 226 ghz. If both conditions are met, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nThe relevant cells for number 32 would be:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"memory\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"clock\" }\n]\n\nNow, let's find the row index for number 32 in the table. The first row has a number of 128, the second row has 256, the third row has 32, and the fourth row also has 64. Since the claim refers to number 32, we'll focus on the third row.\n\nComparing the memory value in the third row with the claim, it is not equal to 24 gb qpi gt / s as the actual value is 24 gb qpi 5.86 gt / s.
