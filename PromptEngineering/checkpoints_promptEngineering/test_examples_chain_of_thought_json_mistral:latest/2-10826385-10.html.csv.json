    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that 3 teams have a score of 10.00 or less, specifically geelong, north melbourne, and south melbourne.\n\n2. Locate the relevant data in the table for each team:\n   - For Geelong, the score can be found in the second row, third column (home team score).\n   - For North Melbourne, the score can be found in the third row, third column (away team score).\n   - For South Melbourne, the score can be found in the fourth row, third column (home team score).\n\n3. Check if the scores meet the requirement of 10.00 or less:\n   - Geelong's score is \"9.11 (65)\". To check if it is 10.00 or less, we need to convert the score from goals and behinds to a single integer. In Australian rules football, one goal equals 6 points, and one behind equals 1 point. So, Geelong's score is 65 points (9 goals * 6 + 11 behinds * 1).\n   - North Melbourne's score is \"11.15 (81)\". Similarly, we convert the score to a single integer: 81 points (11 goals * 6 + 15 behinds * 1).\n   - South Melbourne's score is \"8.11 (59)\". Again, we convert the score to a single integer: 59 points (8 goals * 6 + 11 behinds * 1).\n\n4. Compare the scores with the requirement of 10.00 or less: All three teams' scores are more than 10.00, so they do not meet the claim's requirement.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Locate the relevant data in the table for each team\",\n    \"Check if the scores meet the requirement of 10.00 or less\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" }\n  ]\n}",

Compare each row with the given conditions (row_index != 1): For every row in the table, compare the home team score with the one from the second row (St Kilda). If we find a row where the home team score is higher, it would mean that the claim is false.\n4. Check if any comparison results in a higher home team score: Since all rows are already sorted by date and we are only interested in the home team scores, we can start from the first row (geelong) and check each subsequent row.\n5. Find the result: In our table, the highest home team score is 104 (row_index=2), while St Kilda's away team score is 81 (row_index=1).
