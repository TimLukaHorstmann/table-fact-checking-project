The given json contains two main sections, 'columns' which lists all column names, and 'data' which contains rows of data with values for each column.\n2. Determine the meaning of each column. Based on the values in the data section, we can deduce that 'place' refers to the ranking position, 'player' is the name of the player, 'country' is the country they represent, 'score' is their total score and 'to par' indicates whether they are under (negative number), on (e or E) or over (positive number) par.\n3. Analyze the claim statement. The statement \"the place gene littler finish in be t9\" implies that we need to find out if Gene Littler is ranked 9th at the end of the tournament.\n4. Look for Gene Littler's row in the data section. We can do this by searching for a row where 'player' equals \"gene littler\".\n5. Compare the value found in the 'place' column with the target ranking (9th place). If they match, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify structure of given json, Understand meaning of each column, Analyze claim statement, Find Gene Littler's row in data section, Compare 'place' value with target ranking\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"}]\n}",

The score or \"to par\" column will be used to determine the position.\n2. For each row, check the \"score\" and \"to par\" columns. If the calculated score matches the values in these columns, it means that the score has been correctly represented and can be used for comparison.\n3. Compare the scores of all players in the table. Since we are looking for Gary Player's position after one round, find Gary Player's row (6th row) and check his score.\n4. Check if Gary Player's calculated score (71 + 71 = 142) matches the score in the \"score\" column of his row. If it does, then he has played one round, and we can determine his place based on the \"to par\" column.\n5. Compare Gary Player's calculated score with the scores of other players to see if they are lower or higher. If Gary Player's calculated score is equal to or greater than the scores of some (or all) other players, then he is in a higher place than those players.\n6.
