    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, I identify the columns in the table to understand what data each one contains:\n  - place: The position of each player in the leaderboard\n  - player: The name of the golfer\n  - country: The nationality of the golfer\n  - score: The total number of strokes taken by a player over the course of the tournament\n  - to par: The golfer's score relative to par for the tournament (e.g., \"-6\" means 6 under par)\n2. I look for a row in the table that matches the given player (\"nick price\") and country (\"zimbabwe\"):\n   - In the third row, I find \"nick price\" as the player and \"zimbabwe\" as the country.\n3. I compare the score of the matching player with the given score (70 to -2 par):\n   - The score for \"nick price\" from Zimbabwe is indeed 70 in the table.\n4. I check if the position (place) of this golfer is \"t4\":\n   - The first row has a place of \"1\", which indicates that it's not in the top 4 positions, so I move on to the next rows.\n   - In the fourth row, I find \"t4\" as the place for \"nick price\" from Zimbabwe.\n5. To ensure consistency with the given format, I calculate the par relative value of 70 (since it's not explicitly provided in the table):\n   - A score of 70 is even par, so to convert it into a value under or over par, I add a \"-\" sign and adjust the number accordingly: \"-2\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify columns\",\n    \"Find player and country\",\n    \"Compare scores\",\n    \"Check position\",\n    \"Calculate par relative value (if necessary)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\" }\n  ]\n}",
