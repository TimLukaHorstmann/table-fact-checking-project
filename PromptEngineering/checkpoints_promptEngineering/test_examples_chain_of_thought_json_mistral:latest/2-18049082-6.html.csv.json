    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Compare the ranks of Thomas Bj\u00f8rn (Danish) and Tiger Woods based on their scores.\n2. To compare ranks, we first need to find out who has a lower score. In this table, the score is given as the sum of three rounds of golf, e.g., \"68 + 71 + 76 = 215\".\n3. Convert the scores in the table to numbers: Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's score is 215, and Tiger Woods' score is also 215 (row 9).\n4. Since both players have the same score, we cannot determine who ranks lower based on this information alone.\n5. However, there is a column \"to par\" that indicates how many strokes over or under par the player was for the tournament. A lower number means closer to par, and potentially a better performance (unless marked with an 'e', which stands for even par).\n6. In this case, both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn (+5) and Tiger Woods (+5) are the same number of strokes over par.\n7. Since they have the same score and are the same number of strokes over par, we still cannot definitively say who ranks lower based on this information.\n8. In a real-world scenario, further data such as ties being broken by other factors like the lowest score in the final round or total number of birdies (or eagles) could be used to determine ranking. However, without this additional information, we cannot definitively say who ranks lower.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare the ranks of Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods based on their scores.\",\n    \"Find the scores for each player.\",\n    \"Convert the scores in the table to numbers.\",\n    \"Determine if one score is lower than the other.\",\n    \"If one score is lower, compare their 'to par' values.\",\n    \"Since both players have the same score and are the same number of strokes over par, we cannot definitively say who ranks lower.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\" }\n  ]\n}",
