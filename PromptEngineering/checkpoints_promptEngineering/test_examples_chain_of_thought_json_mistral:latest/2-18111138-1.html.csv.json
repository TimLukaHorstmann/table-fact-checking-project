    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. Identify the columns and rows in the table to look for relevant data.\n   2. The claim states that \"rashid budaj be the coach for qadsia\". To verify this, we need to find out who the coach of Qadsia is and compare it with Rashid Budaj.\n   3. In the 'coach' column, we can see that the coach for Qadsia is \"mohammed ibrahem\" in row 1 (index 0).\n   4. We then look for rows where the 'coach' value matches 'Rashid Budaj'. There is no such match in the table.\n   5. Comparing the coach values for each club, we see that they do not match Rashid Budaj.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the columns and rows in the table\", \"Find out who the coach of Qadsia is\", \"Compare it with Rashid Budaj\", \"Look for rows where the 'coach' value matches 'Rashid Budaj'\", \"Compare the coach values for each club\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"coach\"\n    },\n    // No need to list other rows as we found the answer in row 0.\n  ]\n}",
