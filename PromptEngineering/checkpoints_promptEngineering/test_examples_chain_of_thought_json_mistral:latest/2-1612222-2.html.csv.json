In this case, we're interested in the rows with player names \"alexandra stevenson\" and \"serena williams\".\n2. For each identified row, find the column corresponding to \"aces\". This is the third column in the table data.\n3. Extract the values from the \"aces\" column for both players from their respective years (2013 for alexandra stevenson and 2012 for serena williams).\n4. Compare the two extracted values to check if alexandra stevenson has 1 more ace in 2013 than serena williams has in 2012.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can see that:\n- Row index of alexandra stevenson is 0 and the column name for aces is \"aces\". The value from the table is 25.\n- Row index of serena williams (first occurrence) is 1 and the column name for aces is \"aces\". The value from the table is 24.\n\nTo compare these values, we perform the following comparison: 25 > 24 + 1\n\nSince the inequality holds true, our final answer is that alexandra stevenson does indeed have 1 more ace in 2013 than serena williams has in 2012.\n\nThe relevant cells are as follows:\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"aces\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"aces\" }\n  ]\n}\n\nTo represent the reasoning in a JSON format, we can construct the following output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows of alexandra stevenson and serena williams\",\n    \"Find the 'aces' column for each identified row\",\n    \"Extract the values from the 'aces' column for both players from their respective years\",\n    \"Compare the extracted values to check if alexandra stevenson has 1 more ace in 2013 than serena williams has in 2012\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"aces\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"aces\" }\n  ]\n}",
