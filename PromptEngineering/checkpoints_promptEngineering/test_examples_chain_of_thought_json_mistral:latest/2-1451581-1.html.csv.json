Find the data for Shanghai Pudong International Airport: We search through the \"data\" array to find the row that contains \"Shanghai Pudong international airport\". In this case, it's in the 2nd row with a column value of \"rank\": 2.\n\n4. Verify the total cargo load for Shanghai Pudong International Airport: We check the \"total cargo (metric tonnes)\" column for the same row to confirm the total cargo load. Here, we can see that it is indeed 2939157.\n\n5. Compare with the claim: Since Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranks at the 2nd position (not the 3rd as claimed) and its total cargo load matches the given value, the claim is partially correct but not completely accurate regarding the rank.\n\nNow let's present the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the criteria for ranking\",\n    \"Find the data for Shanghai Pudong International Airport\",\n    \"Verify the total cargo load for Shanghai Pudong International Airport\",\n    \"Compare with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total cargo (metric tonnes)\" }\n  ]\n}",

Find the row in the table that corresponds to this airport based on the name (the first column). In this case, it can be seen that the 17th row corresponds to \"o'hare international airport\".\n3. Compare the rank value of the identified row (17) with the claim that the airport is ranked 17th. Since they match, we can say that the rank is consistent with the claim.\n4. To confirm the claim, check if the total cargo for this airport (the 4th column) matches with any other airport in the top 17 ranks. If no match is found, it means the airport's position (rank 17) is due to its total cargo.\n5. Iterate through the top 17 rows and compare their total cargo values with that of \"o'hare international airport\" until finding a mismatch or reaching the end of the list. In this case, it can be seen that all other airports up to and including rank 16 have higher total cargo values than \"o'hare international airport\".\n6.

Loop through the rows in the table starting from the second one since the first row contains column headers and does not contain any data. For each row, check if both conditions are met (the rank is greater than 4 and the airport matches Shanghai Pudong International Airport).
