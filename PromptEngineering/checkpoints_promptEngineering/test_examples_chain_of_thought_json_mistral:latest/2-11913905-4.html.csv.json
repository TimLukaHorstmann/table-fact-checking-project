    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The date for the item undergoing overhaul, restoration or repair should be 1956.\n\n2. Filter out rows that indicate an item is undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs from the table data. In this case, we are interested in the last two rows as they both have \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\" in the description column.\n\n3. Check if any of these filtered rows (last two rows) also match the condition that their date should be 1956. This information is found in the 'date' column of the table data.\n\n4. Compare the dates of the filtered rows with 1956. In this case, none of the last two rows have a date matching 1956.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Filter out rows for items undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\", \"Check if any of these rows match the condition that their date should be 1956.\", \"Compare the dates of the filtered rows with 1956\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",
