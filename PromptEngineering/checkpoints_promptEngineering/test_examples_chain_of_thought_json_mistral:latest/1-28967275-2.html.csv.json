    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that episode 31 originally aired on 19 April 2008.\n\n2. Determine the structure of the table: The table consists of two parts - 'columns' (headers) and 'data'. The data is an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents a row in the table.\n\n3. Find the relevant row: To verify the claim, we need to find the row that corresponds to episode 31. In this table, the \"episode\" column represents the episodes number and '31' is the episode number we are interested in. We will iterate over the rows (sub-arrays) in the 'data' array until we find the one where the first element matches '31'.\n\n4. Check the original air date: Once we have found the relevant row, we can check the third element of that sub-array which corresponds to the \"episode title\" column. We are interested in the original air date, so we will compare the found value with '19 April 2008'.\n\nNow, let's output the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the structure of the table\",\n    \"Find the relevant row based on episode number\",\n    \"Check the original air date of the found row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"episode title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"original air date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIn this example, the row_index 7 corresponds to the row where episode 31 is found.
