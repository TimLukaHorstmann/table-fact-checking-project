    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. First, we need to find the win percentage (number of wins divided by total number of games) for each team. Since the data only provides the number of wins and losses, we'll assume that the total number of games is the sum of their wins and losses.\n2. Then, we will look for the highest win percentage among the teams that have lost 22 games (according to the given dataset).\n3.
