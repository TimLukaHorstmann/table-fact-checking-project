    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column indices for week and result from the table. The week column index is 0 (since it starts at 0) and the result column index is 3.\n2. Loop through each row in the data array to find the row corresponding to week 13. Since week 13 corresponds to the 13th row, we can directly access that row from the table.\n3. Check if the value of the result column for the row corresponding to week 13 matches \"l 28 - 17\". In this case, we should compare the value at data[12]['result'] (since data index starts at 0 and 12 corresponds to week 13) with \"l 28 - 17\".\n4. If the comparison yields a match, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column indices for week and result\",\n    \"Loop through each row to find the row corresponding to week 13\",\n    \"Check if the value of the result column for the row corresponding to week 13 matches 'l 28 - 17'\",\n    \"If there is a match, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Iterate through each row of data to find a match for the week number (12).\n3. If a match is found, compare the \"result\" column of that row with the claim (28 - 17). The result should be equal to the sum of the two numbers (45).\n4.
