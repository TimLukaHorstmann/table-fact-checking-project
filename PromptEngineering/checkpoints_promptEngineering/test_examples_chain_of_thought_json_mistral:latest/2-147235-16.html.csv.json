Identify the terms to be verified: The claim states that \u65a4 (jyutping: gan1) and \u62c5 / \u64d4 have a relative value of at least 1.\n\n2. Understand the structure of the table: The table has five columns, \"jyutping\", \"character\", \"portuguese\", \"relative value\", and \"metric value\". Each row represents a different item with its respective properties.\n\n3. Find the rows related to \u65a4 (gan1) and \u62c5 / \u64d4: Search for rows where the 'jyutping' or 'character' column matches the required terms (in this case, \"gan1\" or \"\u62c5 / \u64d4\"). We will find out that gan1 is in the 5th row of the data array. The term \"\u62c5 / \u64d4\" does not appear explicitly in the table; however, it can be noted that \"loeng2\", which means \"\u65a4\", has a character \"\\u5169\". In Chinese, when you add a radical at the beginning or end of a character to denote its meaning, the combined character is considered the same as the original character. The radical for \"\u62c5 / \u64d4\" is \"\\u5206\", and when added before \"\\u5169\", it forms the character \"\\u5206\\u5169\". We can find this combination in the 3rd row of the data array (fan1).\n\n4. Check the 'relative value' column for the found rows: Compare the values in the 'relative value' column for both \"gan1\" and \"\\u5206\\u5169\". In the 5th row, we find a relative value of \"1\", and in the 3rd row, we find a relative value of \"1 / 160\", which, when simplified, is equal to \"1 / (160 * 60) = 1 / 9600 = 0.0001125\".

The metric values for \"\\u5398\", \"\\u5206\", and \"cin4\" are given as \"37.79931 mg\", \"377.9936375 mg\", and \"3.779936375 g\" respectively. Notice that the first two values have units in milligrams, which is a unit smaller than grams. However, the third value has units in grams, which is the unit we are interested in for this claim.\n4.
