The relevant row index is 16.\n2. Compare the number of matches, innings, and average for Mark Taylor in the table with those mentioned in the claim.\n   - For matches: The table indicates that Mark Taylor played in 113 matches (at row index 16, column 'matches'). This matches the claim.\n   - For innings: The table shows that Mark Taylor played in 110 innings (at row index 16, column 'innings'). This does not match the claim as stated (\"an innings of 110\"), but since the claim mentions \"with 110 innings,\" it is actually correct.\n   - For average: The table shows that Mark Taylor's average is 32.23 (at row index 16, column 'average').
