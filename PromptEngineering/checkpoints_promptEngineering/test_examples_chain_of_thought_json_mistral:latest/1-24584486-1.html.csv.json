    "resp": "1. Identify the year to be checked: The claim states that the year is 2011.\n\n2. Search for data points corresponding to the specified year: In the given table, we need to find rows where the \"season\" column matches \"2011\".\n\n3. Check if there are multiple rows with the same year: Since there might be more than one series/team in a single year, we need to ensure that there are no duplicates for the specific year 2011. In our table, there are two rows corresponding to 2011, but they represent different series and teams (GP3 Series and GP2 Final).\n\n4. Extract data from found rows: For each row where \"season\" equals 2011, check the values of columns \"races\", \"poles\", and \"wins\".\n\n5. Compare the extracted values with the claim: The first row for year 2011 has 16 races, 1 pole position, and 1 win. The second row for year 2011 has 2 races, 0 pole positions, and 1 win. Combining both rows, we find a total of 18 races, 1 pole position, and 2 wins, which does not match the claim (24 races, 3 pole positions, and 7 wins).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the year from the claim\",\n    \"Search for data points corresponding to the specified year\",\n    \"Check if there are multiple rows with the same year\",\n    \"Extract data from found rows\",\n    \"Compare the extracted values with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"races\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"races\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
