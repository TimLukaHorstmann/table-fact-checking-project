Determine the series of each tournament: The WTA Tier I series was replaced by the Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 categories in 2009, so any tournament before that year is not part of the Tier I series. However, since all provided tournaments are present in both the Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 categories today, we can assume they were part of the Tier I series in 2001 as well.\n\n3. Count the number of times Serena Williams appears as a winner: To do this, iterate through each row (match) in the \"winners\" column and check if it contains \"serena williams\".
