Identify the number of unique opponents in the table: The 'opponents' column contains 5 distinct teams/locations - \"eccles\", \"manchester\", \"dalton hall owens col\", \"hurst\", and \"whalley range\".\n2. Check if any opponent appears more than once: To find this out, compare each row where the 'opponents' column is not empty with every other non-empty row. In our table, \"eccles\" appears in two rows (1st and 2nd) while all other opponents appear only once.\n3. Determine if there is any other opponent that also appears more than once: Since we have checked all the opponents and found that only \"eccles\" appears more than once, there are no other opponents that play twice.\n4. Compare the claim with our findings: The claim states that \"eccles be the only opponent to play 2 times\". Our finding in step 3 aligns with this claim.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in a valid JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"1. Identify unique opponents\",\n    \"2.

Extract the months from the converted dates and compare them to find out if there are 3 months between the earliest and latest rounds.\n4.
