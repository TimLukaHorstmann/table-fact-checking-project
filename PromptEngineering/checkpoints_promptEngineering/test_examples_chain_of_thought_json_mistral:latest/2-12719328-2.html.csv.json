Sum up the number of rows where the \"laps\" value is less than 53 to find out how many racers completed less than 53 laps.\n4. Compare the sum from step 3 with the total number of rows in the data array. If they are equal, it means that all racers completed less than 53 laps; otherwise, some racers completed at least 53 laps.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of rows in the data array\",\n    \"Check each row's 'laps' value to see if it is less than 53\",\n    \"Sum up the count of rows where 'laps' < 53\",\n    \"Compare the sum with the total number of rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"laps\" }\n  ]\n}",
