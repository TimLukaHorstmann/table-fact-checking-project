Identify the claim: The claim states that \"gold be not smaller than zero for the nation of Kazakhstan (Kaz) so the total be more than zero\".\n\n2. Locate the relevant row in the table for Kazakhstan (Kaz): Find the row where the \"nation\" column is equal to \"kaz\". In this case, the relevant row index is 4.\n\n3. Check the value of \"gold\" for Kazakhstan: Look at the value of the \"gold\" column in the found row. The value in this case is 0.\n\n4. Determine if gold is not smaller than zero: Since the value of gold for Kazakhstan is 0, it does not meet the condition that it should be not smaller than zero.\n\n5. Based on step 3 and 4, determine if the total be more than zero: Since gold is 0, the total number of medals (gold + silver + bronze) for Kazakhstan is also 0 (as there are no silver or bronze medals). Therefore, the total will not be more than zero.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim.\",\n    \"Locate the relevant row in the table for Kazakhstan (Kaz).\",\n    \"Check the value of 'gold' for Kazakhstan.\",\n    \"Determine if gold is not smaller than zero.\",\n    \"Based on step 3 and 4, determine if the total be more than zero.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
