For each found row, check the value in the \"stadium\" column. If it matches \"adelaide oval\", then the claim is TRUE. If not, continue checking other rows.\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for all rows where the home team or away team is Adelaide United (since Sydney FC plays as both a home team and an away team). This is necessary because the table contains matches where Adelaide United plays at home against Sydney FC.\n5.
