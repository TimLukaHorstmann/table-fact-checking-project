    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the position of Triston Grant from the table. To do this, we will look for his name in the \"data\" array and find the row containing it. The relevant cell for this is [9, \"player\"].\n\n2. After finding the row of Triston Grant, we will check the column \"position\". This will give us the position of Triston Grant. The relevant cell for this is [9, \"position\"].\n\n3. To find the player drafted in the same round as Triston Grant, we need to find all players with the same \"round\" value. Since the \"round\" column shows the round number of the draft, and each row represents one player, we can simply check if the \"round\" value of any other player is equal to 9 (Triston Grant's round).\n\n4. Once we have found all players with the same \"round\", we will check their positions to see if they play the same position as Triston Grant. The relevant cells for this are [row_index, \"position\"] for each player with the same \"round\" as Triston Grant.\n\n5. If we find at least one player with the same round and playing the same position as Triston Grant, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, if no such player exists, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAfter following these steps, let's check the table:\n\n1. Find the row of Triston Grant: [9, \"player\"] = \"triston grant\"\n2. Check the position of Triston Grant: [9, \"position\"] = \"left wing\"\n3. Check other players in round 9: Only one player exists with the same round, which is John Carter (row index 10).\n4. Check if John Carter plays the same position as Triston Grant: [10, \"position\"] = \"center\"\n5. Since both players are from different positions, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find Triston Grant's row and position\", \"Find other players in the same round\", \"Check if they play the same position as Triston Grant\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"}]\n}\n```",
