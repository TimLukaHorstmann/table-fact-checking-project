However, it appears there may be a typo in the name as \"mario simone timelli\" does not match any of the names in the table. Let's assume this should be \"Marco Simoncelli\" instead.\n2. Determine the relevant columns: Since we are interested in finding out if Marco Simoncelli won the 250cc race in round 9, we will focus on the \"row\", \"grand prix\", and \"250cc winner\" columns.\n3. Find the row that corresponds to round 9: To find this, we look for the row where the \"round\" column value is 9. In our table, the row with index 9 corresponds to the British Grand Prix (4th of July).\n4. Check if Marco Simoncelli won the 250cc race in that round: We then look at the \"250cc winner\" column for this row.

Determine the relevant columns: To answer the question, we only need to look at the \"round\" and \"125cc winner\" columns as they contain the round number and the winner of the 125cc race respectively.\n4. Identify the row matching the claim's round number: The claim mentions round 14. In the data, we find a row with a \"round\" value of 14.\n5. Check the value in the relevant column for the identified row: The value in the \"125cc winner\" column for row 14 is \"juli\u00e1n sim\u00f3n\".
