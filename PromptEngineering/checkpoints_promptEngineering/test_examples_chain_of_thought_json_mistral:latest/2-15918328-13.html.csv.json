Identify the column names of the table which will help us find the relevant data:\n   - couple\n   - style\n   - music\n   - choreographer (s)\n   - results\n\n2. Search for the rows where the \"choreographer (s)\" value is 'sonya tayeh'. In this case, there are two such rows with index 1 and 5.\n\n3. Examine the style column in the found rows to see if it indicates Jazz. In this case, the style of row 1 is 'jazz' and the style of row 5 is also 'jazz'.\n\n4. Compare the styles between the rows where the choreographer is 'sonya tayeh' to find which one(s) indicate Jazz. Here we see that both rows with index 1 and 5 have Jazz as their style, meaning there are two possible matches.\n\n5. Determine if either of the rows where the choreographer is 'sonya tayeh' and style is Jazz is a match for the claim:\n   - For row 1, the 'choreographer (s)' value is 'sonya tayeh' and the 'style' value is 'jazz'.
