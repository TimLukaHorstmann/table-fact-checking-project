Next, we identify the relevant columns in the table: \"round\", \"player\", and \"nationality\". We're interested in players whose round is greater than 4 (we don't need the other columns at this stage).\n3. Then, we filter the data based on the condition. In this case, we'll look for rows where the \"round\" value is greater than 4.\n4. Finally, we check if all the players from the filtered data are either from Canada or the United States.\n\n   Here's the output:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Understand the claim\",\n       \"Identify relevant columns\",\n       \"Filter data based on the condition\",\n       \"Check if all the players are from Canada or the United States\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 6,\n         \"column_name\": \"round\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 6,\n         \"column_name\": \"player\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 6,\n         \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }",
