Determine if there is a column named 'stages' which corresponds to the number of stages for each race.\n3. Check each row in the table to see if any entry in the 'stages' column matches 8 (the number of stages in the claim).\n4. If a match is found, check if the corresponding year for that row also appears in either 1959 or 1976.\n5. If a match is found where the year corresponds to one of the given years, return true and relevant cells.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the answer:\n\n1. Identify the table columns and data: The table consists of five columns (year, date, stages, distance, winner) and multiple rows containing data for each race.\n\n2. Understand the claim: The claim states that stage 8 was only reached in the year 1967.\n\n3. Search for rows where the \"stages\" column is equal to 8: In this table, there are two such rows with a 'stages' value of 8 in rows 5 and 17.\n\n4. Check if these rows also have the same year value as 1967: Row 5 has a 'year' value of 1959, which is not equal to 1967. However, row 17 does have a 'year' value of 1967.\n\n5. Check if there are any other rows with the same stage value in years other than 1967: Since there are no other rows in the table where the \"stages\" column is equal to 8, it can be concluded that there are no other instances of this condition.\n\n6.
