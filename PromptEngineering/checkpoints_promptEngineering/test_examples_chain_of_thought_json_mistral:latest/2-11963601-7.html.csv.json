Identify the condition of the claim: The score of a game where Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points should be 100 - 99.\n2. Find all rows in the table that match the condition of having Manu Gin\u00f3bili as the lead scorer with 44 points: Loop through each row and compare the \"leading scorer\" and \"score\" columns. In this case, the relevant row is the 13th row where the \"leading scorer\" column has the value \"manu gin\u00f3bili (44)\" and the \"score\" column has a value that needs to be compared with 100 - 99.\n3. Compare the score of the found row with 100 - 99: In the 13th row, the score is 112 - 105. This does not match the condition of being 100 - 99.\n4.
