Find the row that matches the claim condition: To find the relevant row, we need to look for a row where the \"diameter\" value is exactly \"14 mm\" and the \"weight\" value should be close but not exactly equal to \"0.55 g\", as the weight can have some tolerance (indicated by \"(0.01)\" in the table).\n4. Examine the found row: In this table, there's no row where both the \"diameter\" and \"weight\" match the given claim conditions exactly. However, we find a row where the \"diameter\" is equal to \"14 mm\", but the \"weight\" (0.55 g) is not exact but close (0.01 tolerance):\n   - Row with index 0: [ \"1 \\u20a7\", \"0.006 (0.01)\", \"14 mm\", \"0.55 g\", \"aluminium\" ]\n5. Interpret the results: Since there is a row that matches the \"diameter\" and has a weight close to the given value, it means that the coin with a diameter of 14 mm could have a weight close to 0.55 g.
