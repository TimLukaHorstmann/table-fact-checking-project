In this case, the relevant row is the first one with a \"game\" value of 76.\n\n4. Compare the high rebounds values for Luis Scola in all games: To determine if Luis Sola scored the highest number of high rebounds in game 76 on April 1, we need to compare his rebound count in that game with his rebound count in other games.\n\n5. Evaluate the claim: In game 76, Luis Scola had 14 high rebounds (as stated in the first row's \"high rebounds\" column). By examining all the rows in the table, we find that Luis Scola has higher rebound counts only in games 78 and 79. However, these instances involve shared high rebounds with other players.
