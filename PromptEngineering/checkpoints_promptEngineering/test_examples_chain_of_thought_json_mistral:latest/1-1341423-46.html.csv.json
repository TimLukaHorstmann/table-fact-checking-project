    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that \"in 1982, norman sisisky was re-elected\".\n\n2. Identify the relevant column for year of first election: The year of first election can help us determine if a representative was re-elected in a specific year. In this case, the relevant column is \"first elected\".\n\n3. Find the row corresponding to norman sisisky: We need to find the row where the \"incumbent\" is \"norman sisisky\". In this table, that corresponds to the third row.\n\n4. Check the year of first election: In the third row, under the column \"first elected\", we see that norman sisisky was first elected in 1982.\n\n5. Check if he was re-elected in 1982: In the third row, under the column \"results\", it is stated that norman sisisky was re-elected.\n\nWith this information, we can conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: 'in 1982, norman sisisky was re-elected'\",\n    \"Identify relevant column for year of first election: 'first elected'\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to norman sisisky\",\n    \"Check the year of first election\",\n    \"Check if he was re-elected in 1982\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"first elected\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"results\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim to be evaluated: The claim states that \"norman sisisky was re-elected after 1982\".\n\n2. Determine which data in the table corresponds to norman sisisky: We look for a row in the 'data' array where the 'incumbent' column contains 'norman sisisky'.\n\n3. Check if there is more than one match for the incumbent: If there are multiple rows with the same incumbent, we need to verify that they correspond to different election years. In this case, since there is only one row with 'norman sisisky', we can proceed.\n\n4. Confirm the year of first election for norman sisisky: We look at the 'first elected' column in the corresponding row to find out when norman sisisky was first elected, which is 1982 in this case.\n\n5. Determine if norman sisisky was re-elected after 1982: Compare the year of first election with the value in the 'results' column for the row in question. If it indicates \"re - elected\" or any other form of re-election, then we can conclude that he was indeed re-elected after 1982.\n\n6. Output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Evaluate if 'norman sisisky' was re-elected after 1982\",\n    \"Identify the row that corresponds to 'norman sisisky'\",\n    \"Check if there are multiple rows with the same incumbent\",\n    \"Determine the year of first election for 'norman sisisky'\",\n    \"Confirm if 'norman sisisky' was re-elected after 1982 by comparing the year of first election with the results\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"results\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
