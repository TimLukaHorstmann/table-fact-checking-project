In this dataset, there are 7 Canadian players who are centers (Don McLean, Randy Andreachuk, Dennis Sobchuk, Willie Friesen, Reggie Lemelin, Marcel Labrosse). There is no player listed as a center from the United States in this dataset.\n\n4. Compare the claim with our findings: The claim states that all centers are from the United States. Since we found no centers from the United States in this dataset, it means that all centers are not from the United States.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the column of interest (position).\", \"Iterate through all rows and check if they are centers.\", \"Compare our findings with the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position\" }\n  ]\n}",
