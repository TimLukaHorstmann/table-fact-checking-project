Early 2010 includes games from April 1 to April 30, 2010.\n3. If a row containing Lamarcus Aldridge and an appropriate date is found, we check the \"high points\" column in that row to determine if he had the highest points in that game.\n4. If no rows containing Lamarcus Aldridge and an appropriate date are found, or if a row is found but he doesn't have the highest number of points, then the claim is FALSE because we haven't found a game where he was the high scorer.\n5. Since the claim also mentions high rebounds, we check each row to see if it contains Lamarcus Aldridge and if he has the highest number of rebounds (in the \"high rebounds\" column).\n6. If no rows containing Lamarcus Aldridge are found, or if a row is found but he doesn't have the highest number of rebounds, then the claim holds that he was not the high rebounder in any game.\n7. Inspect each row to see if Lamarcus Aldridge has the highest points and the highest rebounds for the respective game. If such a row is found, the claim would be FALSE because it states that he was only the high scorer in one game but not the high rebounder in any game.\n8. If no row is found where Lamarcus Aldridge has the highest points and the highest rebounds for the respective game, then the claim holds that he was the high scorer in one game but the high rebounder in zero games.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player of interest (Lamarcus Aldridge)\",\n    \"Check each row for Lamarcus Aldridge and early 2010 game\",\n    \"If found, check if he has the highest points in that game\",\n    \"If not found, or if no highest points, then claim is FALSE\",\n    \"Check each row for Lamarcus Aldridge and high rebounds\",\n    \"If not found, or if no highest rebounds, then claim holds that he was not the high rebounder in any game\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
