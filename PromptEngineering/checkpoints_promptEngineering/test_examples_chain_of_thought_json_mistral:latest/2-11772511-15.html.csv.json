Analyze the table structure: The table contains columns for 'round', 'player', 'position', 'nationality', and 'college / junior / club team (league)'.\n\n3. Find relevant data: Look for the row that corresponds to Brandon Sutter in the 'data' array. In this case, it's the first row with values [1, \"brandon sutter\", \"c/w\", \"canada\", \"red deer rebels (whl)\"].\n\n4. Extract position and round data: From the relevant row, extract the 'position' and 'round' values, which are \"c/w\" and 1 respectively.\n\n5. Check if position is C or W and position was drafted in round 1: The player Brandon Sutter plays either C or W, as stated in the table, and he was drafted in round 1, also according to the table (row index 1).\n\nThe answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output with explanation and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Analyze the table structure\",\n    \"Find relevant data\",\n    \"Extract position and round data\",\n    \"Check if position is C or W and position was drafted in round 1\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

To do so, check for the \"player\" value matching \"brett bellemore\". The relevant row is at index 5.\n3. Examine the nationality of Brett Bellemore by looking at the \"nationality\" column in the identified row (row_index = 5).\n4.
