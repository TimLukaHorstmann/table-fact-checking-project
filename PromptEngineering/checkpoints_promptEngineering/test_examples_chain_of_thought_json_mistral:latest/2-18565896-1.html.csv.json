Third, check if there are any rows in the table where the 'nation' is either 'Poland' or 'Spain' and the 'gold' value is 0 (as per the claim).\n4. Fourth, verify that for the nations identified in step 3, the total of silver + bronze medals equals 2 as per the claim.\n5. Finally, compare the number of rows where the conditions in steps 3 and 4 are satisfied to ensure both nations meet these conditions simultaneously.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify total number of rows\",\n    \"Check if 'gold' value is 0 for 'Poland' or 'Spain'\",\n    \"Verify that the sum of 'silver' + 'bronze' equals 2 for the identified nations\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"silver\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"silver\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" }\n  ]\n}",
