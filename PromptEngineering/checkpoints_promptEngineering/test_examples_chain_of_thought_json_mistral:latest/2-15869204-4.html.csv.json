If the maximum rebound total found is equal to or greater than 13, then the answer would be \"TRUE\" (the claim is correct). Otherwise, the answer would be \"FALSE\" (the claim is incorrect).\n\nWith that being said, here's my final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: high rebounds\",\n    \"Scan all rows in data array to find maximum value in 'high rebounds' column\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"high rebonds\"\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
