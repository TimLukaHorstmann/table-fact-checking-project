Understand the table structure: The table provides a list of episodes, with each episode's details like title, podcast date, run time, and historical references.\n3. Compare each run time in the table to the limit of 6 minutes: Starting from the first row (episode number 301), compare its run time \"6:07\" with the claim limit of 6 minutes. The run time is greater than 6 minutes, so move on to the next episode.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each subsequent episode: Continue comparing the run times of all episodes in the table with the claim limit of 6 minutes.\n5. Check if any episode's run time is equal to or greater than 6 minutes: If you find an episode whose run time equals or exceeds 6 minutes, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Understand table structure\", \"Compare each run time with the limit of 6 minutes\", \"Check if any episode's run time equals or exceeds 6 minutes\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThe answer is TRUE, because none of the episodes have a run time greater than 6 minutes.",
