Check for the row corresponding to the date \"november 19\" in the data array. If found, this row will contain the information about the game played on that day.\n\n3. Extract the values from the columns \"home\" and \"score\" of the identified row, as these are the relevant ones for our claim. If they match the claim (Montreal in the home column and 4-2 in the score column), then the answer is TRUE.\n\n4. Check if the extracted information matches the claim. If it does, return a JSON object with the reasoning and the final answer. If not, return a JSON object with the reasoning and the final answer as FALSE.\n\nHere is the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check for the row corresponding to 'november 19'.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team we are looking for (Montreal) from the table. In this case, the team name is \"montreal\" but it appears as the \"home\" column in the table, so we need to find rows where the 'home' value is \"montreal\".\n\n2. Examine the \"score\" column in the rows with a home team of \"montreal\". The score values should provide us with the required information about whether Montreal has scored 4 goals and conceded 2 goals in any game.\n\nAfter examining the table, we can see that in row 9, the 'home' value is \"montreal\" and the 'score' value is \"4 - 2\".
