Identify the relevant data based on the claim: We are looking for the row of the player with a score of 66 (column \"score\") and check if they have the first place (column \"place\").\n\n2. Find the row index of the player with a score of 66: Iterate through the rows of the \"data\" array until we find a row where the value in the \"score\" column is 66. In this case, it's the first row with index '0'.\n\n3. Check the \"place\" column for the identified row: The player in the first row has a value '1' in the \"place\" column, which indicates a place. We can see that this is not the first place as the position number is greater than 1.\n\n4. Verify the final answer and relevant cells: Since the player with a score of 66 does not have the first place, the answer is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player with 66 points, check their position\", \"Find the row index of the player with 66 points\", \"Check the 'place' column for this row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":\"0\",\"column_name\":\"score\"},{\"row_index\":\"0\",\"column_name\":\"place\"}]\n}",
