If we find any player whose career span contains such a gap, note that player as a potential candidate for having a 3-year break in their career.\n4. After checking all players, if only one player is found to have a 3-year break or more, then the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- For each player row, we will look at the cell with column name \"career span\" (which contains the start and end year of the player's career).\n\nNow let's analyze Kevin Murray's career span:\n- Kevin Murray played from 1955 - 1964, then had a break until 1967, and continued playing until 1974.
