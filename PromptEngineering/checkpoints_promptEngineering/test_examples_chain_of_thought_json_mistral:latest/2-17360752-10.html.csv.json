To check if this is true, we need to find the rows where the score equals 3-2 (i.e., the fourth and fifth elements in each row are '3' and '2') and then find these rows based on the condition that the date is after the game with index 78 (i.e., the first element in each row is greater than 78).\n4.

The \"columns\" section lists all the column headers, and the \"data\" section consists of an array of rows containing data for each game.\n\n3.
