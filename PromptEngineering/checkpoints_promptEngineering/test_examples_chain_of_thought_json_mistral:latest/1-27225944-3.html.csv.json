Determine if the table contains a row with the values matching the claim.\n3. Check each row in the 'team' and 'outgoing manager' columns to find a match. In the first row, \"hrvatski dragovoljac\" is the team and \"damir bi\u0161kup\" is the outgoing manager, not \"ivan pudar\". In the fourth row, \"hrvatski dragovoljac\" is the team and \"ivan pudar\" is the outgoing manager, but we need to check if it also matches the condition of leaving due to mutual consent.\n4. Check each row for the condition of 'manner of departure' as 'mutual consent'. In the fourth row, 'manner of departure' is 'mutual consent', which matches the condition.\n5. Compare the row found in step 3 and 4 with other rows to ensure it is unique.

Determine the structure of the table: The table consists of columns (team, outgoing manager, manner of departure, date of vacancy, replaced by, date of appointment, position in table) and rows containing data for each team.\n\n3. Find the relevant row(s): To find the row(s) related to rieka, we search for a \"team\" value that matches \"rieka\". In this case, the relevant row has an index of 4.\n\n4. Identify the outgoing manager for rieka: In the found row (row 4), the value in the \"outgoing manager\" column is \"nenad gra\u010dan\".\n\n5.

Find the matching row(s): In this table, there is one row where both conditions are satisfied: Row 5 (hrvatski dragovoljac, lokomotiva). The corresponding values for 'replaced by' and 'manner of departure' are 'ivan pudar' and 'mutual consent', respectively.\n   4.
