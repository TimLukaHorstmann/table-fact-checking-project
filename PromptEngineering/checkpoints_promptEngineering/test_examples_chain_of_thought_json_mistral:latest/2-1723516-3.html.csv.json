Iterate through each row of data in the table to find a match with the given score (\"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\"). However, since the score is not in the format that can be directly compared, we will need to parse it first.\n3. Parse the score column values by splitting them using the comma and space characters, resulting in a list of individual scores for each set.\n4. Compare the parsed score with the given score ([4, 6, 4, 3]). If they match, identify the row index where the match occurred.\n5.
