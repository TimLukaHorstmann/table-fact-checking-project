Since October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days, we can count backwards 3 full months from the first date in the table (October 18, 1978) to find the last day of September (September 30, 1978).\n\n2. Second, check each row in the table and compare the \"date\" column value with our starting date and the end date (December 31, 1978). If a date falls within this range, it is considered part of the last 3 months of 1978.\n\n3. Third, count the number of rows where the date falls within the specified period. In this case, we are looking for tour matches since the claim specifically mentions \"there be 13 tour match\".\n\n4. Finally, compare the count with the expected value (13).

Check the dates for each match: For each row in the filtered data, check if the 'date' value is later than the 25th of October 1978.\n\n4. Compare the results: If all the dates are later than the 25th of October 1978, then the claim is TRUE. If any date is earlier or equal to the 25th of October 1978, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's check the data based on these steps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Filter the data based on the month (October of 1978)\",\n    \"Check each filtered row's date is later than or equal to 25 October 1978\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFor the filtered data, all dates are later than the 25th of October 1978, so the claim is TRUE.",
