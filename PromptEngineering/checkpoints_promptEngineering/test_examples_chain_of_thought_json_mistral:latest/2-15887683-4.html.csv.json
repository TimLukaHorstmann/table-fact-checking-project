Find evidence in the table: After examining the table, we see that \"cartello promozionale sky hd\" is an offer that does not include Sky Calcio but is offered by Sky, which means there is another package/option available with Sky (excluding free-to-air and Sky Calcio).\n5.

Check if the data provided has information related to the claim:\n   - The data contains a list of various television channels and their respective languages, but it doesn't explicitly state that they are only available in Italy or that they can only be accessed in Italian.

In this case, since there are 20 entries in the dataset, but one of them is a \"promozionale\" that doesn't offer HD (cartello promozionale sky hd), we have 19 entries left that aren't explicitly mentioned as having HD.
