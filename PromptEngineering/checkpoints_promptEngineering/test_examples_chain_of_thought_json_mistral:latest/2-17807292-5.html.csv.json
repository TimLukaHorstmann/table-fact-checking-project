Check the placement of each player by looking at the first column (\"place\"). The lower the placement number, the better the position.\n3. Count the number of players with a placement value less than or equal to \"t4\" (which includes 4th place). In this case, there are 4 players with a placement value less than or equal to \"t4\".\n4. Identify these 4 players from the table by looking at their respective rows:\n   - Row 1: Ben Curtis (excluded because he has a score higher than par)\n   - Row 2: J B Holmes (-1 to par, not tied for third place yet)\n   - Row 3: Henrik Stenson (-1 to par, not tied for third place yet)\n   - Row 4: Sergio Garc\u00eda (+1 to par, not tied for third place yet)\n   - Row 5: P\u00e1draig Harrington (+1 to par, not tied for third place yet)\n   - Row 6: Charlie Wi (+1 to par, not tied for third place yet)\n\nSince J B Holmes and Henrik Stenson are still in contention for a better position, they can't be included in the group that ties for third place.

Check the \"to par\" values for each player to see if they match the ones with lower placement values:\n   - J B Holmes (-1 to par):\n     a) Ben Curtis has 208 which is not equal to 209 (J B Holmes's score).
