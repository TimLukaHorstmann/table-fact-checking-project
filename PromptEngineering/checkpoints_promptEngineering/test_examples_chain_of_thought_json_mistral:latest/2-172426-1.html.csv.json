Find the row that corresponds to princess Louise in the table: In this case, it is the rows with index 5 and 6, as they both have \"Louise\" in the name dates column.\n4. Extract the relevant data from the table: From these rows, we can see that the date of birth for princess Louise is in the row 5 and the \"date married\" column is 1889.\n5. Calculate the age at marriage: To calculate her age at marriage, we find the difference between her year of marriage (1889) and her year of birth (assuming she was born on January 1st of that year). In this case, the difference is 46 years.\n6. Compare the calculated age to the claim: The claim states that princess Louise got married when she was around 38 years old. Comparing the calculated age (46) to the claim (around 38), we can see that they are not equal, but 46 is greater than 38.\n7.

Determine the criteria for identifying a 'divorced' princess: In this table, the column \"husband dates\" shows the dates when each princess was married to her husband and when that husband died or left the data set (if still alive). Since no further information about potential divorces is provided, we can assume that if a princess remarried after her listed husband's death, it implies a divorce.\n\n3. Check the 'husband dates' of each princess: For each row in the table, check if the listed husband is still alive (i.e., the \"husband dates\" end date is later than or equal to the current year) and whether there is another row with the same princess but a different husband.\n   - If a princess has remarried after her listed husband died, she had a divorce.\n   - If a princess's last husband is still alive, it means she did not get divorced (as per our assumption above).\n\n4. Evaluate each princess based on the defined criteria:\n   - The first six princesses in the table do not meet the criterion of having remarried after their listed husbands died because all of their husbands are deceased, and there is no row for any of them with a different husband. Therefore, these princesses did not get divorced.\n   - Princess Anne (row 7) has two rows in the table. In the first row, her husband died in 1947, and she remarried in 1973 (her second row). This means that Princess Anne got a divorce.\n   - Princess Anne (row 7) is the only princess who meets the criterion of having remarried after her listed husband's death, making it appear that she might be the only one to have gotten a divorce.\n\n5. Verify whether there are any other princesses with divorces: To confirm that Princess Anne is indeed the only one with a divorce, carefully re-examine all rows in the table without assuming anything about future remarriages or deaths of the remaining living husbands.

Determine the husband of the identified princess: For this princess, we can see that her husband is \"william ii\" according to the \"husband dates\" column.\n3. Verify if the date married falls after the princess' 12th birthday: We need to find the date when she was exactly 12 years old and compare it with the \"date married\". To do this, we can subtract 12 from the first year in the \"princess royal from\" column. For Mary, that would be 1631 - 12 = 1619. If the \"date married\" is greater than or equal to this value, then it's valid.\n4. Compare the obtained result with the given claim: If the \"date married\" is greater than or equal to the calculated birth year + 12, then the princess did marry her husband after her 12th birthday (which supports the claim). Otherwise, it contradicts the claim.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the princess mentioned in the claim\", \"Determine the husband of the identified princess\", \"Verify if the date married falls after the princess' 12th birthday\", \"Compare the obtained result with the given claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: We found Mary in the first row of the table, and her date married was 1641. Subtracting 12 years from the start year of her being princess royal (1631) gives us 1619. Since 1641 is not greater than or equal to 1619, it contradicts the claim that Mary married William II after her 12th birthday.",

Find the row where Charles I is present in the table. To find this, check the 'parent' column for names matching \"charles i\" and note down the corresponding row index(es). In this case, the row index is 1.\n\n3. Check the data in the 'date married' column for the identified row. This will give us the year when Charles I was married. The value is \"1641\".\n\n4. Subtract the marriage year from a hypothetical year of death before age 40 (39 years). In this case, we are looking for a year less than or equal to 1600 - 39 = 1561.\n\n5. Check the 'princess royal from (date) to (date)' column for the identified row. This will give us the span of years when Charles I was the princess royal. If the start year is before the calculated potential death year, and the end year is less than or equal to the marriage year, it means that Charles I died before age 40. In this case, the value is \"1642 - 1660\". Since 1642 is greater than our calculated potential death year (1561), we cannot confirm that Charles I died before age 40 based on this information alone.\n\n6. However, since there are multiple rows for each person in the table representing different periods of their lives, check if there is another row with a start date for 'princess royal' before 1561 and an end date after 1561.\n\n7. Scanning through the rows again, we find that there are no such rows.
