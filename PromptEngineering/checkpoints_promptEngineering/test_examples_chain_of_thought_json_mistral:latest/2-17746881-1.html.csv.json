The columns represent the headers, while the data is divided into rows with multiple sub-elements for each match.\n\n3. Identify the relevant columns: In this case, the claim refers to Team 1 scores (which can be considered as points) during the 2nd round. Therefore, the relevant columns are \"team 1\" and \"2nd round\".\n\n4. Iterate through the data: Go through each row in the data section and check for teams from Team 1 who scored 0 points in the 2nd round by comparing their score with '0'.\n\n5. Count the occurrences: For this claim, if we find more than 1 team scoring 0 points during the 2nd round, then it would be a false statement. If there's only 1 or no teams scoring 0 points in the 2nd round, then the claim is true.\n\n6.
