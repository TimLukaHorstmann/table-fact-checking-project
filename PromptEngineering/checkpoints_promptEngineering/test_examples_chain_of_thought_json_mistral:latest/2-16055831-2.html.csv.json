Since the first row shows the year 1995, it means the fighter's first win was in that year.\n3. Look for the latest win to determine when the fighter had his last win. To do this, we need to find the row where the 'record' column increases by one (indicating a loss), as the fighter is having consecutive wins before this loss row. The sixth row shows the fighter's record as 5 - 1 - 0, indicating he lost after his fifth win. Since the year in the same row is 2003, it means the fighter's last win was in a year prior to 2003.\n4. Check if there are any more wins after the loss (sixth row). The next rows show losses, so we can safely conclude that the sixth win is indeed the last win for the fighter.\n5.
