Check the equity shareholding for each associate company:\n\n- For the row with index 10 (Taj Madras Air Catering Limited), the type is 'associate' and the group 's equity shareholding is '20%'.

Since a subsidiary cannot be an associate, we can disregard them as well because they do not contradict the claim.\n\n5.
