    "resp": "1. First, identify the column names from the table which will be useful for filtering the games at the Boston Garden. The relevant columns are \"location / attendance\" as it indicates the location of each game, and \"game\" for easy reference.\n\n2. Next, loop through each row of the 'data' array to find all games that took place at the Boston Garden by comparing the location / attendance with the string \"boston garden\". This will give us a list of rows where the game was played at Boston Garden.\n\n3. Then, for those rows, check the \"game\" column to see if the date is before December 17. To compare dates in this format (month day), first, convert both dates into date objects and then compare their timestamps. If the timestamp of a game's date is less than or equal to the timestamp of December 17, it means that game was played on or before December 17.\n\n4. Finally, if all games at Boston Garden have dates that are either equal to or before December 17, then the claim \"there be 8 game at the boston garden , all before december 17\" is TRUE. If any of the games played at Boston Garden had a date later than December 17, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object for the final answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant columns: location / attendance and game\",\n    \"Loop through each row to find games at Boston Garden\",\n    \"For those rows, check if the date is before December 17 by comparing their timestamps\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
