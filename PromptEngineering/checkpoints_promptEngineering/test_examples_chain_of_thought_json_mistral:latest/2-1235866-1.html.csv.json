    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim, which states that \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 points\".\n2. Understand the table structure. It contains columns \"year\", \"entrant\", \"chassis\", \"engine\", and \"points\". The data for each year consists of the entrant, chassis, engine, and points scored by that entrant in that specific year.\n3. Examine the given years and their respective points in the table: 1963 (0), 1964 (11), 1966 (multiple values).\n4. Compare the points scored in the given years with the requirement of having less than 10 points. In this case, only 1963 meets this condition.\n5. Check if there are any other instances where team lotus had less than 10 points in a year. To do this, we look for any row where the entrant is \"team lotus\", year column is different from 1963, and the points column is less than 10. In our given table, there are no such rows.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: '1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 point'.\",\n    \"Understand table structure: columns - 'year', 'entrant', 'chassis', 'engine', 'points'; data for each year consists of entrant, chassis, engine, and points scored.\",\n    \"Examine years and their respective points in the table: 1963 (0), 1964 (11), 1966 (multiple values)\",\n    \"Compare points with requirement of having less than 10 points.
