We cannot determine the exact date as the table doesn't specify the year for each record. However, since we have records from the start of April, we can assume that any losing streak within the first three weeks of April (up to April 23) could be a candidate for the longest losing streak in April 1986.\n2. Examine the \"loss\" column and find consecutive rows where the value is not \"postponed (rain) rescheduled for april 17\". We can ignore these rows since they were postponed due to rain, so their place in the sequence may be different from the original schedule.\n3. Check if there are any 4 consecutive losses among the remaining rows that belong to the Blue Jays.\n\nBased on the data provided, we see that the \"loss\" column shows a streak of three losses for the team 'Royals' from April 18 to April 20. However, there is no fourth loss for the Royals or any other team in the given data that belongs to the Blue Jays and could potentially form a 4-game losing streak within the first three weeks of April 1986.\n\nTherefore, the \"chain_of_thought\" is as follows:\n1.

Check each game for a consecutive loss: Analyze each of the Blue Jays' games on April 17, 18, 19, and 20 to determine if they represent a losing streak.
