If the winner matches, check the \"owner\" column of the same row to see if any of the listed owners (self, king, morgenson, travis, et al) appear as the owner for that year.\n4.

The relevant cell in this row is the one labeled \"owner\", which contains the string \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\".\n\n3. Check if the extracted owner matches the claim owner (in this case, \"self / king / morgenson / travis , and et al\"). The extracted owner from the table does match the claim owner.\n\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns for the claim: \"winner\" and \"owner\". These columns will help us determine if a horse named \"flashy lassie\" was owned by the specified group after 2009.\n\n2. Loop through each row in the data starting from the latest year (2012) and move backwards to find the row corresponding to the year 2009. This is because the claim asks about ownership \"after 2009\".\n\n3. For each row, compare the \"winner\" column with \"flashy lassie\". If it matches, proceed to compare the \"owner\" column with the specified group \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". If they match, then the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for all the rows until we find a row where the \"winner\" does not match \"flashy lassie\", as this indicates that we have reached the year before 2009.\n\nThe final answer, based on the table provided, is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns for the claim\",\n    \"Start from the latest year (2012) and loop backwards until we find a match for 'flashy lassie'\",\n    \"For each matching row, compare the 'owner' column with the specified group\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"owner\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Determine the columns in the table and their respective data types. The columns are \"year\", \"winner\", \"jockey\", \"trainer\", \"owner\", and \"time\". The 'winner' column contains the names of horses, the 'owner' column contains the names of the horse owners.\n3. Check the data in the table for any entries where the 'winner' is Blueeyesintherein, after 2009 (row index >= 10). The relevant row index for this condition is 10 (the first entry after 2009) with 'winner' as \"Blueeyesintherein\".\n4. Check the value in the 'owner' column of this row to see if it contains \"Overbrook farm\" or any reference to \"et al\". The value is \"self / king / morgenson / travis, et al\", which includes \"et al\", indicating there are other parties involved in the ownership. However, since we are looking for exact matches, this does not satisfy the claim.\n5. Check if there are any subsequent entries where the 'winner' is Blueeyesintherein and the 'owner' column contains a match for \"Overbrook farm\". There are no further rows with 'winner' as \"Blueeyesintherein\", so we have checked all possible matches in the table.\n6.
