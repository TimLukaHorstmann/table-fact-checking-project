Since the span for kochi tuskers kerala is only one year (2011), I will look for a team in the table that has a \"span\" ranging from 2011 to any year later, as this would indicate they have played against kochi tuskers kerala during their span.\n4.

Calculate the win percentage for each team separately:\n   - Rajasthan Royals: win % = won games / total games\n     As there is only one tied game, the total games will be (won + lost + tied) = (5 + 0 + 1) = 6\n     So, win % for rajasthan royals = won / total games = 5 / 6 = 0.833 or 83.33%\n   - Kochi Tuskers Kerala: win % is not applicable as they only played two matches and lost both (lost = 2, tied = 0, so total games = 2).\n\n3. The claim is asking for the average win percentage between these two teams, but since we cannot calculate an average with one team having no wins, it's not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on this data alone.

Identify the opposition teams whose win percentage against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Daredevils (DD) we want to calculate: SRH and DD.\n2.

Since SRH has only one match (lost), we get 1 for lost. For DD, they have not lost any matches, so 0 for lost. As for win, since SRH has not won any matches against this opposition (0 wins), while DD has won all their matches (4 wins).\n4. Calculate the percentage of wins by dividing the number of wins by the total number of matches and multiplying by 100. For SRH, this would be 0/1*100 = 0%. For DD, this would be 4/4*100 = 100%.\n5.
