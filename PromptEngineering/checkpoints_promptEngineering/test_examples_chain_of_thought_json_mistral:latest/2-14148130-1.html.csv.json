Inspect the rows and observe that there are 6 such rows, each representing a completed game. The first row appears to be an incomplete or invalid entry since it has zeroes for the columns 'drawn', 'lost', and 'points difference'.\n4. Observe the column named 'drawn' to determine the number of drawn games. Since there are 6 complete games, we should expect at most 1 drawn game among these (based on the claim).\n5. Inspect the values in the 'drawn' column for each complete game and observe that there are 4 games where this value is 0, 1 game where this value is 1, and no games where this value is greater than 1.
