    "resp": "1. Identify the key elements of the claim: The claim states that a hydraulics issue (represented by a 'hydraulics' value in the 'time / retired' column) driven by Damon Hill has a grid number bigger than 1.\n\n2. Locate Damon Hill's row in the table data: To find Damon Hill, we look for the row where the 'driver' column matches \"damon hill\". The relevant row is at index 18 (row_index=18).\n\n3. Check if Damon Hill's row contains a hydraulics issue: We examine the value in the 'time / retired' column for the Damon Hill row (row_index=18). If it does not contain 'hydraulics', then the claim is false as there would be no match. However, the value is \"hydraulics\" which means we have a potential match.\n\n4. Determine if Damon Hill's grid number is bigger than 1: In the same row, we look for the 'grid' column (column_name=\"grid\") to find out the grid number for Damon Hill. The value in this column is \"7\" which is less than 1.\n\n5. Conclusion based on claim requirements: Since the grid number for Damon Hill does not meet the requirement of being greater than 1, the final answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key elements of the claim\",\n    \"Locate Damon Hill's row in the table data\",\n    \"Check if Damon Hill's row contains a hydraulics issue\",\n    \"Determine if Damon Hill's grid number is bigger than 1\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"grid\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
