The years given in the table start from 1947 (Titus Ozon) and end at 1989 (Victor Piturca). To find if any player played during the desired period, we will check the end year of each player's career and compare it with 1965.\n3. From the data in the table, none of the players have an end year earlier than 1965 (the earliest end year is 1970 for Dudu Georgescu). Therefore, there are no players in the table who played during 1950 through 1965.\n4. Since there are no players during that period, we cannot check if the goal score (sum of goals for all those years) was less than 160 because it is not applicable to this situation.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if there are any players in the table who played during 1950 through 1965.\",\n    \"Determine the end year of each player's career and compare it with 1965.\",\n    \"If no players have an end year earlier than 1965, then there are no players during that period.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step by step:\n1. Compare the name provided in the claim (\"titus ozon\") with the names listed in the table (columns [\"name\"]). This will help us identify the relevant row, if the name exists in the table.\n2. After identifying the correct row, check the years of activity for \"titus ozon\" as specified in the claim (1947 - 1964) with the corresponding year range for that player in the table (columns [\"years\"]). This will help us verify if the given time frame matches with the one present in the table.\n3. Once we confirm the matching row and valid timeframe, compare the number of goals specified in the claim (157) with the number of goals for \"titus ozon\" in the table (columns [\"goals\"]). This will help us determine if the goal count matches the one present in the table.\n4.
