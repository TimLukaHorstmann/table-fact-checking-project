A player scores in an event when the value for that event is greater than zero. In this table, any non-zero values indicate a goal scored. For example, Gamal Hamza has 1 goal in Egyptian Premier League and 2 goals in CAF Champions League, so he scored in at least 1 event. Similarly, Junior Agogo has 3 goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n3. Check all rows for players who scored in at least one event.
