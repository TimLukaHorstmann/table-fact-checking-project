The 'data' array contains rows with each row representing a player's performance at a golf tournament. Each row has five columns: place, player, country, score, and to par.\n\n2. The scores in the 'score' column are two-round totals (e.g., \"70 + 69 = 139\"). We need to calculate each player's actual score by adding the two numbers in their respective 'score' row.\n\n3. The 'to par' column shows how many strokes a player is over or under par for that tournament. For example, a \"e\" means even par (neither over nor under) and \"+ 1\" means one stroke over par.\n\n4. To check if the claim is correct, we need to find all players who have a score of +1 in the 'to par' column. In this case, we will find two players with that value: Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy (in rows 2 and 3 respectively).\n\n5. To confirm if these are the only ones, we check the rest of the data.
