    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team whose record needs to be checked: Charlotte (claim states they improve to 40-36)\n2. Determine the match where Charlotte won a game with an overtime score of 97-92: We need to find a row in the data where both the \"team\" equals 'charlotte' and the \"score\" shows a win (starts with 'w') in overtime (a score difference that is separated by '-' and followed by another number).\n3. Check if the updated record after this game matches 40-36: We need to check the \"record\" value for the row we found in step 2. The format of the record is MM-WW, where MM is the number of wins and WW the number of losses. After this win, Charlotte's record should be updated to 40-36 (4 wins more than their previous loss).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team whose record needs to be checked\", \"Determine the match where Charlotte won a game with an overtime score of 97-92\", \"Check if the updated record after this game matches 40-36\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Check the table to find rows where the \"record\" column matches the target (49 - 36). Since the records are shown in a win-loss format, we need to convert it to a winning percentage of 0.574 (49 wins and 36 losses divided by their sum).\n\n2. Identify the rows where the \"record\" column matches the condition found in step 1. In this table, there are no rows that meet this condition, as all records are either 40-36, 41-36, 41-37, 41-38, 42-38, 42-39, or 43-39.\n\n3.

Iterate through each row in the data array: For each row, compare the value at the \"high points\" column with other rows to find out if Michael Beasley has the highest score.

Find the relevant cells for each iteration: For each row, store the index of the row and the name of the columns where we compare values (in this case, only the \"high points\" and \"score\" columns).\n\n5.
