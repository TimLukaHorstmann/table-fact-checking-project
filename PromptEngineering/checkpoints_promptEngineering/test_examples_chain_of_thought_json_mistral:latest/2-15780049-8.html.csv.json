    "resp": "Here is my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the game number corresponding to the match between Houston and Toronto (game 62). In this table, each row represents a game, and the first column contains the game number. So, we look for the row where the \"game\" value is 62.\n\n2. Once we have found that row, we need to check the columns related to high rebounds. These are the columns labeled \"high rebounds\". We will compare the values in these columns to determine if there was a tie or not.\n\n3. In this case, for game 62, the value in the \"high rebounds\" column is \"vince carter , hakeem olajuwon (7)\". This indicates that both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon had 7 rebounds each.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the table, Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon were indeed the high rebounders in game 62 against Houston.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row corresponding to the match between Houston and Toronto (game 62).\", \"Check the 'high rebounds' column for that row.\", \"Compare the values in the 'high rebounds' column to determine if there was a tie or not.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Orlando wins game 65 with a score of 79 - 92.\n\n2. Find the game data for Orlando: Iterate through the \"data\" array and look for the row where the \"team\" column is equal to \"orlando\". In this case, it's row number 10 (index 9 in Python or JavaScript), with a value of \"orlando\".\n\n3. Check if the game is won: Compare the first element of the \"score\" array in the 10th row (which should be 79) against a string that represents a win, like \"w xx - yy\", where xx and yy are the score values. In this case, the score in row 10 is indeed \"w 79 - 92\".\n\n4. Check if the scores match: Compare the second element of the \"score\" array (which should be 92) against what's mentioned in the claim (92). They both match.\n\n5.
