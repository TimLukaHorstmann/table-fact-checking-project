Determine the structure of the data table: The table provided contains two sections, \"columns\" and \"data\". The columns section lists the column names and the data section contains the data rows as arrays.\n\n3. Find the row that corresponds to Rans Brempong in the data: To do this, we compare the player's name in each row with the one from the claim (Rans Brempong). The relevant cell is:\n   - Relevant Cells: [ { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\" } ]\n\n4. Check if the height of Rans Brempong matches the given value: If the corresponding height value in the row we found matches 2.04 meters, then the claim is true; otherwise it's false. The relevant cell for the height is:\n   - Relevant Cells: [ { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"height\" } ]\n\n5. Verify if the given value (2.04) matches the height of Rans Brempong: In this case, the value in the found row's height column is indeed 2.04 meters.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: The claim is that the height of Rans Brempong is 2.04 meters\",\n    \"Determine table structure: Understand the columns and data sections\",\n    \"Find row for Rans Brempong: Compare the player's name in each row with 'Rans Brempong'\",\n    \"Check height value for Rans Brempong\",\n    \"Verify given value matches height of Rans Brempong\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"height\" }\n  ]\n}",
