    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be evaluated: The claim is \"winter gymnastics have 1 division in the 2011-2012 state tournament\".\n\n2. Identify the relevant data in the table: To evaluate this claim, we need to find the row(s) that have 'winter' for 'season', 'gymnastics' for 'sport', and the number of divisions for the 'tournament structure' column in the 2011-2012 state tournament year.\n\n3. Extract the relevant data: In our table, there are two rows that match the 'season' and 'sport' criteria for gymnastics (winter and gymnastics respectively). We will focus on these rows:\n   - Row 4: [winter, gymnastics, sectional, district, & state, 1, hilliard bradley high school, hilliard]\n   - Row 5: [winter, gymnastics, sectional, district, & state, 1, branin natatorium, canton]\n\n4. Evaluate the claim using the extracted data: Both relevant rows indicate that there is only one division in the 'tournament structure' for winter gymnastics in the given table.

    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The first tournament of bowling took place in 2007.\n\n2. Determine the structure of the data: The table contains a list of columns (season, sport, tournament structure, of divisions, 1st tournament, 2011 - 2012 state tournament location) and rows containing specific data points for each sport or event. Each row represents an event from a different sport in a different year.\n\n3. Locate the relevant row(s): Look for the row(s) where the \"sport\" column has the value \"bowling\". In this case, there is only one such row (row_index = 4).\n\n4. Check the relevant cell: Compare the value in the \"1st tournament\" column of the identified row with the claim's year (2007).\n\n5. Final answer: Based on the comparison made, determine whether the claim is true or false. In this case, since the value in the \"1st tournament\" cell for row_index = 4 matches the provided year (2007), the claim is true.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Determine data structure\", \"Locate relevant row(s)\", \"Check relevant cell\", \"Final answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st tournament\"}]\n}",

Extract relevant data from the table for soccer: First, find all rows in the table where \"sport\" equals 'soccer'. This will give us the data related to soccer tournaments.\n\n3. Check if there is a row that matches the year of the claimed tournament (2011-2012): Next, check if the year of the tournament mentioned in the claim (which is assumed to be 2011-2012 since no specific year was provided) is present in any of the rows found in step 2.\n\n4. Determine the location of the 2011-2012 soccer state tournament: If a matching row is found, check the \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\" column to see if it says 'Crew Stadium, Columbus'.
