For each row, compare the values of the 'grid' column with the value 26 (since the claim states Pascal Fabre started from grid position 26). If a match is found, store that row for further comparison in step 4.\n4. Compare the values of the 'laps' column for the rows found in step 3, with the value 71 (since the claim states Pascal Fabre completed 71 laps). If a match is found, the claim is true.\n5. Since we have found a row where both grid and laps columns match the values specified in the claim, we can conclude that Pascal Fabre started from grid position 26 and completed 71 laps.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns (grid, laps)\",\n    \"Iterate through each row of data\",\n    \"Compare 'grid' column values with 26\",\n    \"If a match is found, store that row for further comparison\",\n    \"Compare 'laps' column values with 71\",\n    \"If a match is found, the claim is true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"grid\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"laps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Next, we need to find out the number of laps completed by these drivers. From the table, both \"derek warwick\" and \"jonathan palmer\" are in positions corresponding to grid position 5 (row indices 4 and 5 respectively). Their values for 'laps' are 74 and 74. Since they have the same number of laps, we cannot determine which one has completed more based on this data alone.\n\n3.
