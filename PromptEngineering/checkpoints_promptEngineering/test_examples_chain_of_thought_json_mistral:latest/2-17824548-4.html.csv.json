The claim also mentions \"shuffle\" and \"jane helen and christine litle\", so we need to break these down as well.\n\n2. Since \"shuffle\" is mentioned in the claim, find the row where draw equals 4. In this table, the fourth row has a draw value of 4 and an artist named \"jane helen\".\n\n3. Check if the combination of artists for this row (in our case, just \"jane helen\") appears in the lyrics/music column. In this row, the lyrics/music are given as \"jane helen (m & l), christine litle (m & l)\". Since we're only concerned about the artist \"jane helen\", we find a match.\n\n4.

Locate the relevant data: To check this claim, we need to find the row corresponding to draw 5 and check the \"lyrics (l) / music (m)\" column.\n\n3. Extract the relevant data: Since the table provided is sorted by draw number, we can easily locate the row with a draw index of 5. In this row, the value for the \"lyrics (l) / music (m)\" column is \"do it again\", which corresponds to the song for draw 5.\n\n4. Find who contributes to the lyrics and music: Now we need to identify who are the contributors for the lyrics and music of the song \"do it again\".
