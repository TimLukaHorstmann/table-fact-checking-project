In the data array, find the row with \"Volvo\" as the \"company\": We see that the 6th row has \"volvo\" in the \"company\" column, so its row_index is 5 (indices are zero-based).\n3. Find the row with \"Sandvik\" as the \"company\": We find that the 10th row has \"sandvik\" in the \"company\" column, so its row_index is 9.\n4. Identify the cells containing employee count for Volvo and Sandvik: For Volvo, we want to know the value in the \"employees\" column for row 5; for Sandvik, we want to know the value in the \"employees\" column for row 9.\n5. Compare the values found: The employee count for Volvo is 98162 (5th row, employees column) and for Sandvik is 50030 (9th row, employees column).\n6.

Compare the size of these companies by looking at their number of employees (column named \"employees\"). The relevant cells are:\n   a. For \"ap m\\u00e3ller - maersk\": row_index = 1, column_name = \"employees\"\n   b. For \"iss\": row_index = 2, column_name = \"employees\"\n   c. For \"volvo\": row_index = 6, column_name = \"employees\"\n3. Compare the values in these cells to determine which company has fewer employees (smaller size). In this case, \"iss\" has more employees than \"ap m\\u00e3ller - maersk\", but neither of them is compared to \"volvo\". Since we are looking for a comparison between transportation and automotive companies, the claim cannot be evaluated with the given data.\n4. The final answer should reflect that the claim cannot be determined from the provided data:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify companies in transportation and automotive industries\", \"Compare their number of employees to determine size\", \"Evaluate whether the company in transportation is smaller than the one in automotive\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"employees\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"employees\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"employees\"}]\n}",
