Compare the years mentioned in the claim (2007, 2009) with the years of the events listed in the table.\n3. Check if there are any rows in the table where the \"year\" column equals either 2007 or 2009.\n4. For each year found, verify if the \"event\" column contains \"10000 m\" or \"5000 m\".\n5. Determine if there is a row where the \"year\" is 2007 and the \"event\" is \"10000 m\", and another row where the \"year\" is 2009 and the \"event\" is \"5000 m\".\n\nThe relevant cells for checking would be:\n- [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"}] for 2007 and 10000 m\n- [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\"}] for 2009 and 5000 m\n\nThe final answer is based on whether we find both sets of relevant cells.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the athlete's events in each year given in the claim.\",\n    \"Compare the years mentioned in the claim (2007, 2009) with the years of the events listed in the table.\",\n    \"Check if there are any rows in the table where the 'year' column equals either 2007 or 2009.\",\n    \"For each year found, verify if the 'event' column contains '10000 m' or '5000 m'.\",\n    \"Determine if there is a row where the 'year' is 2007 and the 'event' is '10000 m', and another row where the 'year' is 2009 and the 'event' is '5000 m'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
