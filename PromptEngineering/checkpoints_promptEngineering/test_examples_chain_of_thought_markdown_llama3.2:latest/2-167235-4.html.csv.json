This confirms that his birth year is indeed 1872.\n3. **Check Death Year**: Similarly, look at the same row for death year confirmation. Yes, it matches: 1963.\n4. **Identify Oldest Prime Minister**: We need to verify if Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the oldest prime minister among all the listed prime ministers. To do this:\n   - Check the table's \"born - died\" column for each entry to identify their lifespans and compare them with Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's.\n5. **Verify Lifespan**: Look at the row for Kostaq Kota (1st time): `born - died` = \"1889 - 1949\". Since his death year is before Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's, he cannot be older in terms of lifetime. The same logic applies to Kostaq Kota (2nd time) and Pandeli Evangjeli (since both have shorter lifespans), further confirming that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri indeed lives longer than these.\n6. **Conclusion**: By verifying the birth year, death year, and comparing with other prime ministers' lifespans, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the Claim\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lives to be the oldest prime minister, with a birth year of 1872 and death year of 1963.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check Birth Year\",\n      \"description\": \"Look at the table for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's row: name = \\\"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\\\", born - died = 1872 - 1963.

The claim mentions two specific dates related to kostaq kota's terms: \"9 november 1936\" (term start) and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri 's term end\". We will focus on the \"term start\", \"term end\", and \"born - died\" columns for this analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant cells\nWe need to find cells that contain the dates mentioned in the claim. There are two possible scenarios:\n- Cell in the \"term start\" column corresponding to kostaq kota's second term, which is 9 November 1936.\n- Cell in the \"born - died\" or \"term end\" columns corresponding to mehdi bej frash\u00ebri, which should contain a date before or after 22 October 1935.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the relevance of the cells\nSince we're looking for evidence that \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri 's term end\" occurs after kostaq kota's term start in the claim, we can check if there is a cell in the table containing mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's last known date before or on 9 November 1936.\n\n### Step 4: Compare dates\nThere are cells corresponding to mehdi bej frash\u00ebri in the \"born - died\" and \"term end\" columns. By comparing these two values, we can see if they fall after kostaq kota's term start date on 9 November 1936.\n\n### Step 5: Draw a conclusion\nIf there is indeed at least one cell containing mehdi bej frash\u00ebri 's last known date after 9 November 1936, then the claim can be concluded as true.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the term start date for Pandeli Evangjeli.\n   - The relevant cell can be found at `| name                          | born - died                 | term start                  | term end                    | political party             |`\n   - Specifically, the cell with the value \"6 march 1930\" in the \"term start\" column.\n\n2. Next, we need to identify kostaq kota's term start date.\n   - According to the table, kostaq kota served from `5 september 1928` to `9 november 1936`.\n\n3. Now, let's compare this information with the claim:\n   - The claim states that kostaq kota's term start is after Pandeli Evangjeli's term end.\n   - We know that Pandeli Evangjeli's term end was on \"16 october 1935\" according to the table.\n\n4. Since `9 november 1936` (kostaq kota's term start) comes after `16 october 1935` (Pandeli Evangjeli's term end), the claim is TRUE.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"term_start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"born - died\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"political party\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim about Pandeli Evangjeli\nThe claim states that \"the only 1st time minister of Albania be Pandeli Evangjeli\". This means we need to check if Pandeli Evangjeli was indeed the first time prime minister of Albania.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if Pandeli Evangjeli had an earlier term as a prime minister\nWe can see that Pandeli Evangjeli served from March 6, 1930, to October 16, 1935. We need to check if he had any previous terms as a prime minister.\n\n#### Step 3: Check the table for any other prime ministers with an earlier term\nLooking at the table, we can see that there is another row named \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" with a start date of October 22, 1935. This suggests that Pandeli Evangjeli may have had an earlier term as prime minister before his second term.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the relevance of the other prime ministers\nThe other prime ministers listed in the table (Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri) do not have any relevant information regarding their terms as prime minister being earlier than Pandeli Evangjeli's first term.\n\n#### Conclusion\nBased on the information provided in the table, we can conclude that Pandeli Evangjeli did indeed serve as the 1st time prime minister of Albania.\n\n#### Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim about Pandeli Evangjeli\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim states that 'the only 1st time minister of Albania be pandeli evangjeli'.
