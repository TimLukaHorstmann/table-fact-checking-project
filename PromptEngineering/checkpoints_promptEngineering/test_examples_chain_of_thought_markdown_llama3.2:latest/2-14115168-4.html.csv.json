Check the relevant data:\n   - Look at each school's \"national titles\" column in the table.\n   - York College has 28 national titles, which is greater than 20.\n   - Peru State College has 2 national titles, which is less than 20.\n\n3. Verify if there are any other schools with more than 20 national titles:\n   - Since the claim only mentions two specific schools (York College and Peru State College), we need to verify that no other school meets this criteria.\n   - Reviewing the table again, it appears that no other school has more than 28 national titles (York College).\n\n4. Conclusion based on steps 1-3:\n   - Based on the data in the table, York College is indeed above the threshold of 20 national titles, but Peru State College does not meet this criteria.\n   - Therefore, it's possible that only one school meets or exceeds the claim of having more than 20 wins. This leads to some ambiguity regarding the truthfulness of the statement as presented.\n\n5. Further check for schools with exactly 2 titles:\n   - As previously noted, Peru State College has exactly 2 national titles.\n   - Since there is no explicit mention that there is only one other school with exactly 2 national titles besides Peru State College in the claim, but we can see other institutions have more than 20 titles, the provided information does not accurately represent a truth about only two schools having more than 20.\n\n6. Conclusion based on step 5:\n   - Given that no school has more than 28 titles (which is above 20) besides York College and that Peru State College has exactly 2 titles, the claim seems to be false because it does not correctly list all relevant information regarding schools with over 20 national titles.\n\n7. Create JSON output based on steps 6:\n   - Based on our reasoning process, we can now output the following JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object includes our chain of thought on the relevant rows and columns in the table, along with the answer to whether the claim is true or false based on that analysis.",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to find the year founded for each school in the table.\n2. Then, we will check if Bellevue University was founded in the 20th century (i.e., between 1900 and 1999).\n3. If it was, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow let's do this step by step:\n\n- **Step 1:** Get the year founded for each school:\n| row_index | column_name    | value          |\n|:----------|:---------------|:---------------|\n| 0         | founded         | 1966           |\n| 1         | founded         | 1923           |\n| 2         | founded         | 1894           |\n| 3         | founded         | 1872           |\n| 4         | founded         | 1882           |\n| 5         | founded         | 1883           |\n| 6         | founded         | 1887           |\n| 7         | founded         | 1865           |\n| 8         | founded         | 1890           |\n\n- **Step 2:** Check if Bellevue University was founded in the 20th century:\nWe can see that Bellevue University was founded in 1966, which is after 1900. Therefore, it was founded in the 20th century.\n\nNow let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}",
