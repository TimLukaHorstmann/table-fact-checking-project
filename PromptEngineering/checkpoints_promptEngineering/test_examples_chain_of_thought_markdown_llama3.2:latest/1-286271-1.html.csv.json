First, let's identify the values for '1988' in the table:\n   - `of candidates nominated`: 68\n   - `of seats won`: 0\n   - `of total votes`: 47228\n   - `% of popular vote`: 0.36%\n\n2. Now, let's identify the value for '1993' in the table:\n   - `of candidates nominated`: 79\n   - `of seats won`: 0\n   - `of total votes`: 32979\n   - `% of popular vote`: 0.24%\n\n3. Next, we need to determine if the claim is true or false. \n   The claim says \"more candidate nominate in 1993 than 1988\". This can be evaluated as follows:\n   Since there are more candidates nominated for '1993' (79) compared to '1988' (68), this makes the statement TRUE.\n\n4.

Next, we need to determine if this is a new highest or second highest percentage.\n   We can do this by comparing it with other percentages in the table.\n\n3. Looking at the table, there are only two entries for each party (the year they were nominated and won no seats).

The only relevant cell is at row 2000 with a \" % of popular vote\" of 0.81%.\n\n5. Since 0.81% is not greater than 6.80%, it cannot be the second-highest percentage.\n\n6. Also, there are no entries with a higher percentage than 6.80%. So we can conclude that the party did not achieve their second highest percentage of popular vote in 2008.\n\n7.

Specifically, we're interested in comparing the percentage of popular vote between these two elections.\n\n### Step 3: Locate relevant cells for 2004\nIn the table, the row corresponding to 2004 has the following values:\n|   election |   of candidates nominated |   of seats won |   of total votes | % of popular vote   |\n|-----------:|--------------------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|:--------------------|\n|       2004 |                       308 |              0 |           582247 | 4.32%               |\n\n### Step 4: Locate relevant cells for 2006\nSimilarly, the row corresponding to 2006 has the following values:\n|   election |   of candidates nominated |   of seats won |   of total votes | % of popular vote   |\n|-----------:|--------------------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|:--------------------|\n|       2006 |                       308 |              0 |           665940 | 4.48%               |\n\n### Step 5: Compare the percentage of popular vote between 2004 and 2006\nThe percentage of popular vote for the Green Party in 2004 is 4.32%, while in 2006, it's 4.48%. Since 4.48% is greater than 4.32%, the Green Party gained a small increase in the percentage of popular vote from 2004 to 2006.\n\n### Step 6: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that the claim \"the green party lose a percentage of the popular vote from 2004 to 2006\" is FALSE, as there was actually an increase in the percentage of popular vote for the Green Party during this period.\n\n### Step 7: Define relevant cells for JSON output\nThe relevant cell rows are:\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"}\n]\n```\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze the table structure\",\n    \"Identify relevant data for the claim (Green Party's percentage in 2004 and 2006)\",\n    \"Locate relevant cells for 2004\",\n    \"Locate relevant cells for 2006\",\n    \"Compare the percentage of popular vote between 2004 and 2006\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\",\n    \"Define relevant cells for JSON output\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
