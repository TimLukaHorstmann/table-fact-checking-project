Identify the most recent tallest structures before 1950 from the table:\n   - Battersea Power Station (last recorded height: 113 ft / 370 ft, located at Kirtling Street)\n\n2. Determine the total height of the structure that comes after this one (Battersea Power Station) in the list, which is One Canada Square (last recorded height: 235 ft / 771 ft):\n   - One Canada Square is taller than Battersea Power Station.\n\n3. Find the difference between the heights of these two structures:\n   - Difference = Height of One Canada Square - Height of Battersea Power Station\n   - Difference = 235 ft - 113 ft\n\n4. Compare this difference to the threshold height (200 ft) provided in the claim:\n   - Since 35 ft is less than 200 ft, One Canada Square does not meet the condition specified by the claim.\n\n5. Now determine if all three structures are at least 200 feet taller than everything that came before 1950. \n   - The only structure that comes before 1950 in the table is Battersea Power Station.

Check if all of the structures after 1950 are at least 200 feet taller than Battersea Power Station:\n   - One Canada Square is indeed over 200 ft taller than Battersea Power Station.\n\n7. The last structure (Shard London Bridge) with a known height of 306 m / 1004 ft is also greater than the 200 ft threshold.\n \n8.

This implies we need to look for data on buildings and structures in Southwark, comparing their heights over time.\n\n2. **Locate relevant data**: We need to identify rows in the table where the location is 'southwark'. The relevant columns are those that could provide information about a building's height over time ('years as tallest', 'height metres / ft').\n\n3. **Filter by time period**: Since we're interested in \"over 3 century pass\", this suggests looking at data spans of at least three centuries. Given the dates, we can filter to see if there is any instance where a structure in Southwark was the tallest over a significant portion of these three centuries.\n\n4. **Determine instances of being 'tallest'**: For each identified row for Southwark, we need to verify that it's the 'tallest' (i.e., the highest height) within its respective time period ('years as tallest').\n\n5. **Check if there is continuity or change in 'tallness'**: We must assess whether any structure in Southwark has held the title of being the tallest for an extended period across at least three centuries, or if the position shifts significantly.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on findings**: After analyzing the data and the claim, we can conclude whether it's true or false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nThe step-by-step reasoning process leads to identifying a few key instances where Southwark has seen structures being the tallest for significant parts of three centuries.\n\n1. **Identify relevant data**:\n   - Relevant rows: 'southwark cathedral' (1650s), 'monument to the great fire of london' (1677-1683), and 'shard london bridge' (2010-present).\n\n2. **Filter by time period**: All three instances span at least 300 years.\n\n3. **Determine instances of being 'tallest'**:\n   - 'southwark cathedral' was the tallest from 1666 to 1677.\n   - 'monument to the great fire of london' became the tallest from 1677-1683, showing a change in dominance.\n   - 'shard london bridge' has been and remains the tallest since its construction started in 2010.\n\n4. **Check if there is continuity or change in 'tallness'**:\n   - There are changes in which structure is tallest over time within these three instances but also an instance of a new tallest being established for most of three centuries without interruption (the Shard).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Southwark has seen structures that have been the tallest for parts of at least three centuries.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify claim's focus and relevant data\",\n      \"description\": \"Claim states 'over 3 century pass between southwark' regarding being tallest, thus looking for Southwark instances in table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Filter by time period\",\n      \"description\": \"Given three-century span, only consider data where the time frame exceeds 300 years.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine instances of being 'tallest'\",\n      \"description\": \"Identify rows for Southwark that are tallest within their respective periods.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if there is continuity or change in 'tallness'\",\n      \"description\": \"Assess if the position shifts significantly across these centuries or remains stable.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",

We then evaluate which rows in the table meet this condition by checking the `location` column:\n   - If a row's location is not \"city of london\", it meets the condition.\n   - Count how many such rows exist, ensuring we only count each once (since 4 out of 10 means at least four must be outside but does not specify that all are).\n\n4.

Upon examining the `location` column, it is found that only one (the Shard) has a location outside of the City of London. This means that there are less than 4 such locations, which inherently fulfills the condition since fewer than four means all can be counted as meeting the criteria without exceeding it.

This means comparing their heights to the columns in 'years' where the starting year is after 1950, up until the end of the table.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the tallest structure of interest\nThe tallest structure of interest for comparison starts at 2010 (the first entry after 1950), which has a height of 306 meters.\n\n### Step 6: Check if all recent structures are taller than those that came later\n- For 'shard london bridge' (2010-): Since the claim's condition is to be compared against structures after 1950 and it clearly fits this, we check the next structure in chronological order, which starts from 1991.\n- The second structure of interest would then be 'one canada square', starting at 1991 with a height of 235 meters.\n\n### Step 7: Evaluate if all three recent structures meet the claim's criteria\nGiven that both the first and second structures (starting in 2010 and 1991 respectively) are taller than those coming after them, we evaluate if there is any structure between these two that meets or surpasses their heights to ensure 'all of the most recent tallest structures' are indeed taller.\n\n### Step 8: Check against 1950\nThe first structure of interest (after 2010) starts at 306 meters. For comparison against structures after 1950, we consider the next structure in chronological order that begins after 1991 and ends before or at 2010 since our interest is in those immediately following 'shard london bridge'.\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nSince the first two tallest structures (starting from 2010) are indeed taller than any structure after them, but also considering there isn't a direct calculation required for the second part of the claim regarding all recent ones being more than 200 feet taller than those following, the critical comparison hinges on meeting 'at least 200 foot taller' requirement against structures immediately preceding or succeeding these most recent ones.\n\n### Step 10: Final Answer\nTo answer this question accurately in the context provided and simplifying the explanation for direct JSON format compliance:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Step 1-9 Explanation Suppressed for Compliance\",\n    \"Given that Shard London Bridge is indeed taller than any structure after it, and considering One Canada Square also fulfills the criteria, but with an error in step counting.\",\n    \"The critical comparison hinges on meeting 'at least 200 foot taller' requirement against structures immediately preceding or succeeding these most recent ones.\",\n    \"This indicates a misunderstanding of the claim's application for precise numerical compliance rather than just tallness.\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 87, \"column_name\": \"shard london bridge\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"one canada square\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, let's identify what we're trying to determine from the claim: \"just under 3 century pass before southwark have the tallest building or structure\". This implies that we need to find out when Southwark had its first instance of having the tallest building or structure.\n2. Looking at the table, we see that each row represents a different location (or structure), and there is a column for \"years as tallest\", which gives us information on how long each location was the tallest. However, we also notice that some columns have \"n / a\" in them, indicating that this data is not available.\n3. We need to identify if Southwark had its first instance of being the tallest before 300 years ago (i.e., 1707 CE). Looking at the table, there are two entries for Southwark: one entry for \"southwark cathedral\" and another entry for \"shard london bridge\". \n4. For southwark cathedral we see that it was tallest between 1666-1677 which is indeed before 300 years ago.\n5. Now looking at shard london bridge, we see that it's still in the process of being tallest (its current year as tallest is between 2010-). We can't determine its 'first' instance of being tallest without knowing how long southwark cathedral was the only tallest building in Southwark.\n\n6. Based on our findings from step 3 and step 5, we are unable to confirm that Southwark ever had the tallest structure before a period of just under three centuries passed.\n\n\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}",
