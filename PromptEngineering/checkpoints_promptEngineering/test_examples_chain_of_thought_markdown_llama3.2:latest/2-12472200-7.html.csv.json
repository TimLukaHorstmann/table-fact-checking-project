Specifically look for rows under \"grand slam tournaments\" and examine her win/loss record.\n    - The key row here is `row_index` = 2 (2008) with \"win - loss\" being 3-4, indicating she never won the tournament.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        \"Check if Olga Govortsova has ever reached the final in any grand slam tournament.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. We need to determine if Olga Govortsova won at least 1 grand slam tournament match in any given year from 2007-2011.\n2. Let's check the table for grand slam tournaments held in each year:\n   - 2007: grand slam tournaments (a)\n   - 2008: grand slam tournaments (a)\n   - 2009: grand slam tournaments (a)\n   - 2010: grand slam tournaments (a)\n   - 2011: grand slam tournaments (a)\n3. Since all years have \"grand slam tournaments\" listed, it is possible for Olga Govortsova to win at least one match in any of these years.\n4. Next, let's check the table for wins and losses against grand slam tournament opponents:\n   - 2007: 2-2\n   - 2008: 3-4\n   - 2009: 3-4\n   - 2010: 1-4\n   - 2011: 1-4\n5. Although Olga Govortsova has won matches against grand slam tournament opponents in the past, we need to check if she won at least one match in any given year from 2007-2011.\n6. Let's check the table for \"grand slam tournaments\" and \"year - end championship\" columns:\n   - 2007: No record of winning a grand slam tournament match\n   - 2008: No record of winning a grand slam tournament match\n   - 2009: No record of winning a grand slam tournament match\n   - 2010: No record of winning a grand slam tournament match\n   - 2011: No record of winning a grand slam tournament match\n7.

We need to focus on the cells that correspond to these tournaments.\n\n3. **Examine the wins and losses**: In a grand slam tournament, it is possible for a player to reach the second round (a loss). If this happens, then Olga Govortsova has advanced further than the second round in at least one grand slam tournament.\n\n4. **Check if there are any other grand slam tournaments with higher wins and losses**: We need to verify that there isn't another grand slam tournament where Olga Govortsova reached a deeper round.\n\n5. **Analyze the \"year - end championship\" column**: This column might provide additional information about Olga Govortsova's performance in non-grand slam events.\n\n6. **Consider if Olga Govortsova has advanced further than the second round in other types of tournaments**: If we find that she has reached a deeper round in any non-grand slam tournament, it could confirm the claim.\n\n7. **Make a final judgment**: After analyzing all relevant data points, we can conclude whether or not Olga Govortsova has ever advanced further than the second round in a grand slam tournament.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"2009\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year - end championship\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

To determine if Olga Govortsova has won at least 5 grand slam tournament matches in any given year from 2007-2011, we need to check the \"grand slam tournaments\" column for each year.\n2. In 2007 and 2010, there is no information about whether Olga Govortsova has won a grand slam tournament that year. We can ignore these years.\n3. In 2008, the cell value for the number of wins (\"win - loss\") is 3-4, which means she did not win any grand slam tournaments that year.\n4. In 2009, the cell value for the number of wins is also 3-4, indicating she won no grand slam tournament that year.\n5. We can now focus on 2011. The \"grand slam tournaments\" column shows an entry of \"a\", which means Olga Govortsova did win at least one grand slam tournament in 2011.\n6. Next, we need to calculate the total number of wins for 2011: there is only one entry of \"1 - 4\" indicating she lost all her matches. Thus it cannot be five.\n\n7. Now we'll go back and examine each year again with a focus on any indication that Olga Govortsova won at least five grand slam tournaments in the given period, starting from 2008:\n   In 2010, there is an entry for \"grand slam tournaments\" showing \"a\", which indicates she did win one tournament.\n   The total number of wins (2-4) also indicates that Olga Govortsova won two grand slam tournaments.\n\n7. After verifying the entries in each cell for a total of five grand slam tournament wins, we need to check whether it is possible for her to have such an achievement. Given our findings so far we can only verify she has at least 3 grand slam tournament wins (2 in 2010 and one in 2011).\n\nGiven that Olga Govortsova won no more than three of the four years in question with a minimum total number of five tournaments, it is indeed possible for her to have achieved this feat.\n\nHere's the output as instructed:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"2010\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2007\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To verify this claim, we should examine the \"year - end championship\" column in the table for each year from 2007 to 2011.\n\n3. Let's start with the first year (2007). The value in the \"year - end championship\" column is \"year - end championship\", which means it has not been held (NH).\n\n4. Moving on to the next year (2008), the value remains the same as the previous year, which also indicates that the championship was not held.\n\n5. For 2009 and 2010, the values are again \"year - end championship\". This implies that both championships were held in these years.\n\n6. However, for 2011, the value is \"not held\" (NH), but more importantly, it also mentions that the year-end ranking was 114, which is lower than any of the previous years.\n\n7.
