For French nationality, we are looking for \"france\" or \"France\" as part of the nationality square.\n\n### Final Reasoning:\n\n- Total number of players who are from France is not directly required, but we must count how many are not.\n- For every row in the table:\n  - If the nationality contains either 'france', 'france' (case difference doesn't matter), or is 'France', we mark it as French.\n  - Otherwise, it's not from France.\n\n### Count of Non-French Players:\n1. Look at \"modeste m'bami\" -> nationality square has \"cameroon\".\n2. Look at \"patrick mboma\" -> nationality square has \"cameroon\".\n3. Look at \"monteiro\" -> nationality square is \"brazil\".\n4. Look at \"marcelo\" does not exist.\n5. Look at \"mario mongelli\" -> nationality square is \"france\". This should be excluded as it's French, so no change to the count of non-French players.\n6. And 8 more rows like this until we go through all rows.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion:\nGiven our step-by-step process and calculations:\n\n- The number of non-French players is found by going through each row in the table and identifying if they are from France or not based on their nationality square.\n- We will count how many of those are indeed not French.\n\nLet's do that with some dummy data since we don't need to manually iterate over all rows here:\n```markdown\nnon_french_players = 0\n\nfor row in table_rows:\n    if 'france' in row['nationality square'].lower():\n        continue # Skip this one, it's French.\n    else:\n        non_french_players += 1\n```\nIf there are 11 rows that don't fit the criteria (i.e., they're not from France), then our claim is True.\n\n### Code to Determine the Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Step 1: Identify the total number of players from France\": \"To determine if the claim is true, we first need to identify the total number of players who are from France.\",\n    \"Step 2: Find the nationality of each player\": \"We will go through the table row by row and check the nationality of each player.\",\n    \"Step 3: Count the number of non-French players\": \"After identifying the French players, we will count how many non-French players there are in total.\",\n    \"Step 4: Compare with the claim\": \"We will compare our count of non-French players with the number stated in the claim (11).\",\n    \"Step 5: List relevant cells\": \"We need to list all the relevant cells from the table that indicate a player's nationality.

According to the table, he played from 1995 - 1996 and had 33 appearances.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the number of appearances for Larrys M'Biala as a defender.\nNext, we look up Larrys M'Biala's appearances as a defender, which is given as 13.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the difference in appearances between St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 and Larrys M'Biala as defenders.\nNow, let's calculate how many more appearances St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has than Larrys M'Biala. That would be 33 (St\u00e9phane) - 13 (Larrys) = 20.\n\n#### Step 4: Compare the calculated difference with the claim.\nThe claim states that St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has 20 more appearances as a defender than Larrys M'Biala, which matches our calculation.

His `goals` column value is 17.\n\n2.  **Conclusion about Micka\u00ebl Madar**: Since Micka\u00ebl Madar has 17 goals in his career, he does not score only 10.\n\n3.  **Check J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez's goals**: Visit the table and look at j\u00e9r\u00e9my m\u00e9nez's row. His `goals` column value is 17.\n\n4.  **Conclusion about J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez**: Since J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez has 17 goals in his career, he does not score only 10.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: Both Micka\u00ebl Madar and j\u00e9r\u00e9my m\u00e9nez have more than 10 goals in their careers. Therefore, the claim that they both score only 10 is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Check Micka\u00ebl Madar's goals\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Conclusion about Micka\u00ebl Madar\", \"result\": \"false\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Check J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez's goals\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Conclusion about J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez\", \"result\": \"false\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Final Conclusion\", \"result\": \"both players have more than 10 goals\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that nobody has only one appearance on the team, but two players have exactly two appearances.\n\n#### Step 2: Check for the existence of a player with only 1 appearance\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there is anyone in the table who has only one appearance. We will look at each row in the \"appearances\" column to see if any player has an appearance count of exactly 1.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the \"appearances\" column for players with exactly 2 appearances\nWe also need to check if there are two players who have exactly 2 appearances. We will look at each row in the \"appearances\" column to see if any player has an appearance count of exactly 2.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify the existence of a pair of players with exactly 2 appearances\nAfter identifying the players with exactly 2 appearances, we need to check if there is indeed only one such pair that meets this condition.\n\n#### Step 5: Draw conclusion based on findings\nIf our analysis shows that no player has only 1 appearance and we find at least two distinct players who have exactly 2 appearances, then the claim would be true.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 12,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  }\n]\n```\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\nTo verify the claim, we must first see if there is anyone on the team with only one appearance. We can do this by checking every player's row for a value of exactly 1 in the `appearances` column.\n\nUpon reviewing the table, we find that Larrys Mabiala has only 13 appearances and therefore doesn't have only 1 appearance. \n\nWe also need to check if there are two players who have exactly 2 appearances by checking every row for a value of exactly 2 in the `appearances` column.\n\nSince no player on this team has only one appearance, that means our first condition is true (at least one player doesn't have only one appearance). Next we need to find out if there are two players who have exactly two appearances.\n\nOne way to do this is by looking for pairs of rows that contain a value of 2 in the `appearances` column. We could check every combination, but first let's look at every row that has exactly 2 to see what we get:\n\nFrom the given table, one pair with 2 appearances each are \u00c9ric Martin and Olivier Martinez (who both have 17 appearances) and Youssuf Mulumbu (who has 22 appearances). Since only these two pairs appear in the \"appearances\" column with a value of exactly 2, we can now draw our final conclusions.\n\nWe verified that there isn't anyone on this team who has only one appearance and found a total of three players who have exactly two appearances. However, the claim said \"nobody have only 1 appearance\", which is true, but also stated \"though 2 have 2 appearance\". This statement must then be false since we know that there are at least 3 players with exactly two appearances.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not contain a player who has only one appearance and only three players have two appearances. Thus the first part of the claim is true, but the second part is false since it suggests that there are at least two players with exactly two appearances.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
