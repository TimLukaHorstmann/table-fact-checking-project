    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to find out if there is an event called 'all-africa games' in the table.\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that there are two events: \n   - `2007 | all - africa games` and\n   - `2013 | world championships`.\n3. We should focus on the first one because it's about the 'all-africa game', not world championships in 2013.\n4. In the row of '2007 | all - africa games', we can see that the athlete got a position of '2nd' and this is the event of interest for our answer.\n5. Next, we need to find out if there are any other positions than second place in the event of the 'all-africa game'.\n6. Since there's only one relevant row of '2007 | all - africa games', we can't confirm that there's no higher position because of its rarity and the limited information available.\n7. However, since there is a claim stating \"the highest position be second place at the all - africa game\", we need to look for a case where an athlete got the highest possible position in the 'all-africa game' event.\n8. We can't confirm that no one has ever gotten the highest position of 1st in the all-africa games because our information only includes some results, but not every single one.\n9. Thus, based on what we have, we cannot confirm the claim.\n\nHere's the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

So, Japan hosts the competition 2 times.\n\n3. **Count Events for Hungary**: Count the number of times Hungary hosted the competition.\n   - From step 1, one event is in Hungary: World Road Running Championships (Debrecen). So, Hungary hosts the competition 1 time.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Claim**: The claim states \"japan and hungary host the competition 3 time each\".
