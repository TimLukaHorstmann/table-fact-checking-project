    "resp": "#### Claim Evaluation\n\n1. First, we need to identify the home teams and their respective results.\n   - The home team for September 10th's game was Marshall (at Joan C Edwards Stadium) who won against No. 23 West Virginia with a result of W 24-21 OT.\n   - The home team for September 11th's first game was Indiana State (at Nippert Stadium) who won against Cincinnati with a result of W 40-7.\n\n2. Next, we need to identify all the home teams and their results in all the games played on September 11th. \n   - South Florida (at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium) lost to No. 8 Florida with a result of L 14-38.\n   - Texas Southern (at Rentschler Field) won against Connecticut with a result of W 62-3.\n   - New Hampshire (at Heinz Field) won against Pittsburgh with a result of W 38-16.\n\n3. We need to analyze if the home team wins all games played on September 11th. \n   - Indiana State won, South Florida lost and Texas Southern won. The results for these three home teams were consistent with what we observed in step 2.\n   - The only game missing is Eastern Kentucky (at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium) who won against Louisville with a result of W 23-13.\n\n4. Now, let\u2019s evaluate the last row \u2013 Syracuse (at Husky Stadium) lost to Washington with a result of L 20-41.\n   - Since this is also at home for the visiting team, it does not affect the outcome.\n\n5. Based on the observations above, we can confirm that all home teams won their respective games played on September 11th.\n\n6.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the games played in the middle of the day.\n   - These are the games played between 12:00 pm and 3:30 pm.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the attendance for each of these games.\n   - This will be our \"middle-of-the-day\" group.\n\n3. Then, we need to identify the games played in late afternoon or evening.\n   - These are the games played between 7:00 pm and 1:00 pm (inclusive) but outside of the middle-of-the-day time frame.\n\n4. After that, we should find the attendance for these \"late afternoon or evening\" games.\n   - This will be our comparison group.\n\n5. Finally, we compare the two groups:\n   - We need to check if all games in the \"middle-of-the-day\" group have lower attendance than those in the \"late afternoon or evening\" group.\n\n### Reasoning Explanation:\n\nBased on the table provided, there are four middle-of-the-day games (games 3-6). The corresponding attendances for these games are 30807, 50120, 51427 and 62418 respectively. In comparison, attendance values of late afternoon and evening games are 41382, 90612, 37359, 62341.\n\nSince all the middle-of-the-day games had lower attendance than those in the \"late afternoon or evening\" group except for one (the game between Syracuse and Washington), the claim provided is False.",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that Washington won against Syracuse in front of 62418 fans at home.\n2. **Locate the relevant cells**:\n   - For \"home team\", we need to check if it's \"Washington\" since it implies the game is played at their home stadium.\n   - For \"visiting team\", we should verify that it's indeed Syracuse, as they are the opposing team mentioned in the claim.\n   - For \"result\" and \"broadcast\", both are not directly relevant for determining the winning team, but it\u2019s essential to ensure there\u2019s no other result indicating a Washington win. We'll check if any column (like 'time' or 'site') might hint at such details indirectly.\n\n3. **Verify home vs visiting teams**:\n   - Looking up row 7 (the row corresponding to Syracuse and Washington), we see that \"visiting team\" is indeed listed as \"Syracuse\", meaning they are the ones coming to play at Washington's site.\n   - The \"home team\" for this game, then, must be \"Washington\".\n\n4. **Check for any wins by Washington**:\n   - In row 7, under \"result\", we see that Syracuse won against Washington with a score of 20-41.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the information above, there\u2019s no indication in the table that Washington won this game. The only detail is about the attendance and which team was at home (which matches our claim), but it clearly states Syracuse won.\n\n6. **Final Answer Format Preparation**:\n   - Since our step-by-step reasoning concluded that the claim was false based on available data, we can now format our answer as instructed.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
