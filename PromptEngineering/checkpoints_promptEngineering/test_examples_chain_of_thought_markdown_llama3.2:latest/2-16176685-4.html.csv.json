Next, we'll do the same for Andrew Panko: divide his total games (38) by 1.\n\n5.

First, let's identify the relevant information for the claim:\n   - Ondrej Starosta's points: 259\n   - Serge Ibaka's points: 234\n   - The difference between their points: 25 (259 - 234 = 25)\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the ranking difference between Ondrej Starosta and Serge Ibaka:\n   - Ondrej Starosta's rank: 4\n   - Serge Ibaka's rank: 3\n\n3. We know that in order for the claim to be true, the following conditions must be met:\n   - The difference in points between Ondrej Starosta and Serge Ibaka is indeed 25.\n   - Ondrej Starosta has one more rank below Serge Ibaka.\n\n4. From our analysis of step 2, we can see that the ranking difference between Ondrej Starosta and Serge Ibaka is 1 (4-3=1), not 0 or 2. Therefore, condition two of the claim is met.\n\n5. However, in order for the entire claim to be true, both conditions must be met, which we can verify as follows:\n   - Since Ondrej Starosta's points are indeed higher than Serge Ibaka's by 25 (condition one), and they have a ranking difference of 1, then it is true that Ondrej Starosta has 25 more points than Serge Ibaka but be 1 rank lower.\n\n6.

Next, let's add these two totals together to get the combined point scoring total:\n   - 259 + 287 = 546\n\n4. Now that we have this total, we can compare it to Jakim Donaldson's points (357) to see if their averages are higher.\n\n5. To do this, we'll calculate each player's average by dividing their total points by the number of games played:\n   - For Ondrej Starosta: 259 / 34 = approximately 7.615\n   - For Andrew Panko: 287 / 38 = approximately 7.553\n\n6. We can then compare these averages to Jakim Donaldson's average (357/36 \u2248 9.917) and determine whether Ondrej Starosta and Andrew Panko's combined average points is higher than Jakim Donaldson's.\n\n### Chain of Thought:\n\n```markdown\n- Calculate total points for Ondrej Starosta: 259 points\n- Calculate total points for Andrew Panko: 287 points\n- Add these two totals together to get the combined point scoring total: 546 points\n- For Ondrej Starosta: 259 / 34 \u2248 7.615\n- For Andrew Panko: 287 / 38 \u2248 7.553\n- Compare averages:\n  - Jakim Donaldson's average: 357/36 \u2248 9.917\n  - Ondrej Starosta and Andrew Panko's combined average (7.615 + 7.553 = 15.168) is greater than Jakim Donaldson's.\n```\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
