Upon reviewing the table, we find that the match day corresponding to an attendance of 15747 is indeed July 2. However, for clarity in identifying the correct match between Fitzroy and North Melbourne on this date at Brunswick Street Oval, let's double-check the relevant details.\n\n6. The row with \"home team\" = \"fitzroy\", \"away team\" = \"north melbourne\", \"venue\" = \"brunswick street oval\", and matching attendance of 15747 on July 2 is confirmed as per the table.\n\n7. Since all specified conditions are met (attendance, match day, venue), we can confidently assert that the claim about the lowest attendance at Brunswick Street Oval during a match between Fitzroy and North Melbourne on July 2 is accurate.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, Geelong has indeed the lowest score.\n\nMelbourne's score, when calculated as twice that of Geelong's, equals 13. To verify this claim we also need to calculate each team's opponent and compare the result with Melbourne's score:\n\n-   Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: Their match was on July 2, 1960. So their score (20.10) is not half of Geelong's (6.5).\n-   Essendon vs St Kilda: Their match was also on July 2, 1960. Thus, their score (12.4) isn't double that of Geelong's.\n-   Richmond vs Collingwood: Played on July 2, 1960. The Collingwood match results in a higher value than half of Geelong's.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Geelong has the lowest score among all teams.\",\n      \"result\": \"TRUE\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Verify if Melbourne\\u2019s score equals double that of Geelong\u2019s.\",\n      \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
