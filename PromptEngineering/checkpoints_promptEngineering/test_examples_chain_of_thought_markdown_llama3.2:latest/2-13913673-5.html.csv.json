If found, check the score of the game played on that date.\n3. Verify if the score corresponds to a win and loss as claimed by the statement.\n\nNow let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n- **Step 1:** I see a record of an Indian team playing against the Tigers in july.\n- **Step 2:** The opponent in this game is listed as \"tigers\" which does not appear to match with \"indian\".\n- **However**, looking at other entries, I see that there was no indian team playing on july 2008.  \n- **Step 3:** Hence the score cannot be verified.\n\nTherefore my reasoning chain of thought is: \nThe game played by an Indian team on July 31st does not exist in the table and hence the score cannot be confirmed.\n\n\nHere's a JSON object with my final answer:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"the game played by an indian team on july 2008 does not exist in the table\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n    ]\n}",
