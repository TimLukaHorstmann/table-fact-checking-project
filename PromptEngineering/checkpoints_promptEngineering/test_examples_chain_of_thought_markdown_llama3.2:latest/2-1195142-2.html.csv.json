However, this does not directly tell us about his nomination status at the Tony Awards.\n\n4. **Find Nomination Information for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards**: We must look in the table for information related to the \"tony award\" and \"best costume design\" rows to determine if William Ivey Long was indeed nominated or won at the 2005 Tony Awards.\n\n5. **Verify Nominee vs. Winner**: The table lists both a winner (William Ivey Long) under the category of Best Costume Design for the 2005 Tony Awards but only as a nominee in the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design, suggesting he might have been nominated but not necessarily won at the Tony Awards.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Verification**:\n    - Given that William Ivey Long is listed as both a nominee and a winner under different awards categories (Tony vs. Drama Desk), it indicates there might be some inconsistency in the information provided directly by the table.\n    - The original claim is about being nominated for Best Costume Design specifically at the Tony Awards, which aligns with being listed as a nominee but does not confirm if he won.\n\n7. **Answer Based on Conclusion**: Since William Ivey Long was indeed nominated under the category \"best costume design\" in 2005 and this directly matches the claim made (despite the discrepancy in award type), we can conclude:\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify the Claim: The claim is about the nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the Tony Award being William Ivey Long.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Locate Relevant Information: To verify the claim, we need to look up the information about William Ivey Long's nomination status for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Check Nomination Status: According to the table, in the Drama Desk Awards column under the category \\\"outstanding costume design,\\\" there is a row with William Ivey Long as the nominee.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Find Nomination Information for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards: We must look in the table for information related to the \\\"tony award\\\" and \\\"best costume design\\\" rows to determine if William Ivey Long was indeed nominated or won at the 2005 Tony Awards.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 5,\n            \"description\": \"Verify Nominee vs. Winner: The table lists both a winner (William Ivey Long) under the category of Best Costume Design for the 2005 Tony Awards but only as a nominee in the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design, suggesting he might have been nominated but not necessarily won at the Tony Awards.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 6,\n            \"description\": \"Conclusion Based on Verification: Given that William Ivey Long is listed as both a nominee and a winner under different awards categories (Tony vs. Drama Desk), it indicates there might be some inconsistency in the information provided directly by the table.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 7,\n            \"description\": \"Answer Based on Conclusion: Since William Ivey Long was indeed nominated under the category \\\"best costume design\\\" in 2005 and this directly matches the claim made (despite the discrepancy in award type), we can conclude that the statement is true.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 6,\n            \"column_name\": \"won\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"nominated\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

According to the table, there are:\n- 1 nomination for \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\" (Gary Beach)\n- 1 nomination for \"best costume design\" (William Ivey Long)\n\nThese two categories have a total of 2 nominations.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Gary Beach is one of four nominees\nSince there are only 2 nominated actors and no other entries match \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\", it seems that we do not have enough information to assert if Gary Beach was indeed among the four. However, since we verified that he is indeed nominated (Step 1), we can check if his nomination aligns with the given claim.\n\n### Step 3: Check if Gary Beach's nomination aligns with the claim\nAccording to the table, Gary Beach was nominated for \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\". However, this does not directly imply that he is among four nominees, as only two actors were nominated. The original statement says he should be one of 4 nominees but actually says \"nominated\", which has no indication that his name appears with other three.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the claim is true or false\nFrom our previous steps, we can conclude that Gary Beach was indeed nominated for a Tony Award in 2005. However, to see if he was one of four nominees, we must look at the total number of nominations and realize there's not enough information provided about how many other actors were nominated in total.\n\nGiven this lack of concrete evidence and our analysis above that seems slightly confusing due to phrasing but clarifies the issue at hand, the answer leans towards being false because the table clearly states Gary Beach was just one nominee.\n\n### Step 5: Finalize the relevant cells\n- **chain_of_thought**: The steps taken to analyze the claim provided in the prompt.\n- **answer**: FALSE\n- **relevant_cells**:\n    - [\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"nominee\"]\n    - [\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"result\"]\n    - [\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"award\"]=\"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\"\n    - [\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"year\"] = 2005\n    - [\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"nominee\"] = William Ivey Long\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze the total number of nominations for best performance by a leading actor in a musical and costuming to verify if Gary Beach was indeed one of four nominees.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim \"jerry mitchell be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n2. First, let's look at the Drama Desk Awards category in the table. We are interested in Jerry Mitchell because he was nominated and won for two different categories (outstanding choreography).\n\n3. The relevant rows of interest are:\n   - Row 5: `year = 2005`, `award = drama desk award`, `category = outstanding revival of a musical`, `nominee = outstanding revival of a musical`, `result = won`\n   - Row 6: `year = 2005`, `award = drama desk award`, `category = outstanding choreography`, `nominee = jerry mitchell`, `result = won`\n\n4. Looking at row 5, we see that Jerry Mitchell was nominated for Outstanding Revival of a Musical in 2005.\n\n5. Looking at row 6, we see that Jerry Mitchell was also nominated (not \"won\") for Outstanding Choreography in 2005.\n\n6. We don't have any information about him being nominated for a Drama Desk Award three times, but two out of the three categories mentioned have been documented.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the available data from the table, we can say that Jerry Mitchell was nominated for two different Drama Desk Awards in 2005.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyzing relevant rows of interest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Looking at row 5 and row 6 for details about Jerry Mitchell's nominations\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion based on available data from the table\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that Gary Beach should be one of four winners of a Tony Award.\n\n### Step 2: Look at the relevant table data\nFrom the provided table, we see that there are multiple instances where \"won\" is listed under different columns, but none directly related to Gary Beach being part of four winners. However, we can look at column names and row for his entry.\n\n- Column: \"nominee\"\n- Row Index (for his entry): 2005\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the column\nIn this case, the value under the \"result\" column for Gary Beach's row indicates he was nominated but not a winner. Therefore, he cannot be considered as one of four winners.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Looking at the claim that states Gary Beach should be one of four winners of a Tony Award.\",\n    \"Gary Beach is listed under the column 'nominee' for the year 2005 with 'nominated' result.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis conclusion can be drawn directly from the information provided in the table and the claim itself.",
