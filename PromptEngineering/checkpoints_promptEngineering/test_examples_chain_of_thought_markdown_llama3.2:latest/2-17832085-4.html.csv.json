    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that only 1 team remains undefeated.\n2. To verify this, we need to check each team's record for wins, draws, and losses.\n3. A team remains undefeated if they have:\n   - No losses (i.e., `losses` = 0)\n   - More wins than losses\n4. We will iterate through the table and check each team's record.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n5. For the first row (`h\u00e9rcules cf`):\n   - Wins: 16\n   - Losses: 7\n   - Since `wins` > `losses`, `h\u00e9rcules cf` is not undefeated.\n6. For the second row (`granada cf`):\n   - Wins: 16\n   - Losses: 9\n   - Since `wins` > `losses`, `granada cf` is not undefeated.\n7. For the third row (`algeciras cf`):\n   - Wins: 14\n   - Losses: 9\n   - Since `wins` < `losses`, `algeciras cf` is not undefeated.\n8. We continue checking each team's record until we find a match that contradicts the claim.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n9. After examining all teams, we notice that none of them have won every game and lost none.\n10. However, `h\u00e9rcules cf`, `granada cf` and `algeciras cf` do have more draws than losses but not only one undefeated team has less draws and more wins that 16 and so does `CD Mestalla`.\n11. We found that at least one team (`CD Mestalla`) has not lost all matches, which means the claim is false.\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"losses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"losses\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
