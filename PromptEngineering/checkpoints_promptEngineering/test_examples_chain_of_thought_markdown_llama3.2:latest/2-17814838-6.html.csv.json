First, let's identify the columns in the table:\n   - `tie no`: The row number of each game.\n   - `home team`: The name of the home team for each game.\n   - `score`: The score of each game (home team first).\n   - `away team`: The name of the away team for each game.\n   - `attendance`: The attendance at each game.\n\n2. Now, let's analyze the claim: \"of 16 game play in the 2008 - 09 fa cup , 6 need a replay because it be a tie\".\n   - To determine if this is true or false, we need to identify which of the 16 games require a replay due to being tied after their initial match.\n   - We will check each row of the table for rows where `score` shows a tie (0-0), and then verify that a replay was played by looking at the next row in the table.\n\n3. Let's apply this logic:\n   - In row 4, we see that the home team (`sunderland`) and away team (`blackburn rovers`) have a score of `0 - 0`. We need to check if there is a replay for this match.\n   - In row 5, we see that the home team (`hartlepool united`) and away team (`west ham united`) have a score of `0 - 2`, so there's no replay.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim: \"the highest goal score by both team in a tie be 8 when west bromwich albion tie burnley 7 - 7\". This means we need to check if there is any other tie with a higher total score than West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley.\n2. To do this, we'll start by looking at the relevant rows in the table:\n\t* Row 11: West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley has a score of 7 - 7 (total score = 14).\n\t* We need to check if there are any other ties with a higher total score.\n3. Next, we'll look at the remaining rows and check their scores:\n\t* Row 15: Derby County vs Nottingham Forest has a score of 1 - 1 (total score = 2), which is lower than West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley's score.\n\t* Row 12: Torquay United vs Coventry City has a score of 0 - 1, which is also lower than West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley's score.\n\t* All other rows have scores that are either lower or do not affect the total score comparison (since one team wins and the other loses).\n4. After checking all relevant rows, we can conclude that there is no tie with a higher total score than West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze the claim: 'the highest goal score by both team in a tie be 8 when west bromwich albion tie burnley 7 - 7'\",\n    \"Check if there are any other ties with a higher total score than West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley.\",\n    \"Look at row 11: West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley has a score of 7 - 7 (total score = 14).\",\n    \"No other rows have a higher total score.\",\n    \"Conclude that there is no tie with a higher total score than West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the matches involving Arsenal**: From the table, we see two matches: \n   - Arsenal vs Cardiff City (with attendance 20079) \n   - Arsenal vs Middlesbrough (with attendance 57237).\n\n2. **Identify the match involving Manchester United**: From the table, we see one match:\n   - Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur (with attendance 75014).\n\n3. **Calculate the average attendance for Arsenal's matches**:\n   To find the average attendance for Arsenal, we add up the attendances of both their matches and divide by 2.\n   - Attendance at Arsenal vs Cardiff City: 20079\n   - Attendance at Arsenal vs Middlesbrough: 57237\n   \n   Average attendance = (20079 + 57237) / 2 = 43658.\n\n4. **Calculate the average attendance for Manchester United's match**:\n   We only have one data point here.\n   - Attendance at Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur: 75014.\n\n5. **Compare the average attendances**: \n   To compare, we convert both averages into integers if they are not already (if their decimal parts equal to .0). This is because an integer comparison requires only integer values\n   - Average attendance of Arsenal = 43658\n   - Average attendance of Manchester United = 75014\n   \n   Since 43658 < 75014, the average attendance for the match with Arsenal is less than that of the match with Manchester United.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the comparison in step 5, the statement \"the match with arsenal has an average attendance than the match with manchester unite\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
