We see that there are 1156 students who are bears.\n\n### Step 2: Extract the number of students who are patriots\nThe number of students who are patriots can be found in the table by looking at the cells where 'football' is yes (indicating the team has a football team) and 'type' is not relevant, we only care about the enrollment column. We see that there are 700 students who are patriots.\n\n### Step 3: Extract the number of students who are blue raiders\nThe number of students who are blue raiders can be found in the table by looking at the cells where 'football' is yes (indicating the team has a football team) and 'type' is not relevant, we only care about the enrollment column. We see that there are 1893 students who are blue raiders.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the combined number of patriots and blue raiders\nTo calculate the combined number of patriots and blue raiders, we need to add the number of students who are patriots (700) and the number of students who are blue raiders (1893). This gives us a total of 1893 + 700 = 2593.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the number of bears with the combined number of patriots and blue raiders\nNow, we need to compare the number of bears (1156) with the combined number of patriots and blue raiders (2593).

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Determine which institutions were founded in the 1800s.\n   - From the table, we can see that four institutions were founded in the 1800s: \n     Campbellsville University (founded in 1906 is not considered because it was \"founded\" under a different name in 1906;  however) Cumberland University (1842), Georgetown College (1829), and St. Catharine College (1873). This leaves three institutions founded in the 1800s.\n\n2. Count how many of these institutions are located in the mid-south region.\n   - Three institutions were found to be in the 1800s and two of those three, Georgetown College and Cumberland University, have locations in states that might be considered part of the 'mid-south'. But we must look at their respective location's population as well. \n     Campbellsville University is located in Kentucky with a relatively small population (9108), but since the claim mentions \"the mid - south\" it may be possible to argue that it belongs here even though its region might not be considered by most scholars.\n\n3. Determine how many institutions meet the criteria of being founded in the 1800s and located in the mid-south.\n   - Only Cumberland University's location is clearly within the southern United States, however; Georgetown College is also geographically viable for a 'mid-southern' location as it lies near the border between Kentucky and Tennessee. Campbellsville University might be argued to fit under this criterion given its relatively small population in comparison to other 'mid-south' states.\n\n4. Count how many institutions meet the criteria.\n   - There are two institutions that can be said to be located within the mid-south: Cumberland University (population 20235) and Georgetown College (population 29098).\n\n5. Compare the number of institutions meeting the criteria to the total number of institutions in the table.\n   - The claim states \"the majority\" which requires us to evaluate whether more than half of the institutions meet this criterion.\n\n6. Evaluate if the claim is true based on our findings.\n   - Since there are four institutions with dates in the 1800s, and two of them (Cumberland University and Georgetown College) have locations that might be considered part of the mid-south region but only Cumberland's location can be said to truly meet the geographical criteria for the 'mid-southern' classification. The other geographically viable institution has a relatively small population in comparison to other states which might also be classified under the broader southern United States classification.\n\n7. Determine whether the majority of institutions are found in the 1800s and located in the mid-south.\n   - Even though we have two possible, but not conclusive, fit for the \"mid-southern\" classification; there are still four institutions with dates in the 1800s total. And since this is less than half of the table's entries, it would be difficult to make a strong case that the majority meets the given conditions.\n\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"location (population)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"location (population)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

From the table, we can see that there are two such institutions:\n- St Catharine College\n- Cumberland University\n- University of the Cumberlands\n\n### Step 2: Identify the institutions with 'bear' in their nickname\nWe also need to find institutions whose nickname contains the word \"bear\". From the table, we can see that there are two such institutions:\n- University of Pikeville\n- Shawnee State University\n\n### Step 3: Extract relevant cell values for each institution\nFor St Catharine College, Cumberland University, and University of the Cumberlands, which have 'patriot' in their nickname, extract the enrollment value.\n- St Catharine College: 700\n- Cumberland University: 1345\n- University of the Cumberlands: 1743\n\nFor University of Pikeville and Shawnee State University, which have 'bear' in their nickname, extract the enrollment value.\n- University of Pikeville: 1156\n- Shawnee State University: 4300\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the ratio for St Catharine College, Cumberland University, and University of the Cumberlands\nWe need to calculate how many times the number of students who are patriots is compared to the number of students who are bears. For each institution:\n- St Catharine College: 700 / 1156 \u2248 0.6067\n- Cumberland University: 1345 / 4300 \u2248 0.3134\n- University of the Cumberlands: 1743 / 1156 \u2248 1.5128\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nWe need to check if any of these ratios are exactly three times a larger than another. After comparing all possible combinations, we find that Cumberland University's ratio (0.3134) is not three times the other two.\n- St Catharine College and University of the Cumberlands have 1.5128/0.6067 \u2248 2.5 times difference\n- Shawnee State University is too large to be a multiple of any smaller number.\n\n### Step 6: Provide the final answer in JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Identify institutions with 'patriot' in nickname\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Identify institutions with 'bear' in nickname\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Extract enrollment values for each institution\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"Calculate ratios of patriots to bears\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Determine if claim is true or false\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
