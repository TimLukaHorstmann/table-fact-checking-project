These are rows 5, 11, 16, and 22.\n\nStep 3: Analyze these rows to see if all of them have tetragonal crystal structures.

This means we need to compare the number of Tc(k) values in these two rows.\n\n### Step 2: Extract relevant data from the table\nFor hgba 2 cuo 4, the value for t c (k) is 94.\nFor hgba 2 ca 2 cu 3 o 8, the value for t c (k) is 134.\n\n### Step 3: Compare values\nThe difference between these two values is not 20. To verify this, we need to calculate how much more or less one value is compared to the other. For hgba 2 ca 2 cu 3 o 8 - hgba 2 cuo 4 = 134 - 94 = 40.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the claim is true\nGiven that 20 t c (k) more would mean a difference of 20, not 40, we conclude that the claim is false.\n\n\n\n### JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Extract relevant data from the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Compare values\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim is true\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"no of cu - o planes in unit cell\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"no of cu - o planes in unit cell\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
