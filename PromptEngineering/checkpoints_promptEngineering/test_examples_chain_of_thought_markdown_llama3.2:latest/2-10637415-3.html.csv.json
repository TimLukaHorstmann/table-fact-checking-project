    "resp": "### Step 1: Analyze the claim\nThe claim states that the Halifax Blue Sox are the only team to not have gotten a draw during the 1997 World Club Championship.\n\n### Step 2: Find the points of each team\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any of the teams had drawn games. We can do this by looking at the \"drawn\" column in the table.\n\n\n```markdown\n| club              |   played |   lost |   drawn |   against | diff   |   points |\n|:------------------|---------:|-------:|--------:|----------:|:-------|---------:|\n| wigan warriors    |        6 |      4 |       0 |       212 | - 123  |        4 |\n| london broncos    |        6 |      5 |       0 |       238 | - 102  |        2 |\n| bradford bulls    |        6 |      6 |       0 |       228 | - 146  |        0 |\n| st helens rlfc    |        6 |      6 |       0 |       270 | - 174  |        0 |\n| warrington wolves |        6 |      6 |       0 |       256 | - 178  |        0 |\n| halifax blue sox  |        6 |      6 |       0 |       340 | - 284  |        0 |\n```\n\n### Step 3: Look at the drawn column\nAll teams had zero drawn games. This means that the claim is false, as there is no team with zero draws.\n\n```markdown\n| club              |   played |   lost |   drawn |   against | diff   |   points |\n|:------------------|---------:|-------:|--------:|----------:|:-------|---------:|\n| wigan warriors    |        6 |      4 |       0 |       212 | - 123  |        4 |\n| london broncos    |        6 |      5 |       0 |       238 | - 102  |        2 |\n| bradford bulls    |        6 |      6 |       0 |       228 | - 146  |        0 |\n| st helens rlfc    |        6 |      6 |       0 |       270 | - 174  |        0 |\n| warrington wolves |        6 |      6 |       0 |       256 | - 178  |        0 |\n| halifax blue sox  |        6 |      6 |       0 |       340 | - 284  |        0 |\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine the answer\nBased on our analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the points of each team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look at the drawn column\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the answer\",\n      \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the points of each team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look at the drawn column\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the answer\",\n      \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
