Let's focus on players that have played at least one league match. According to the problem statement, we need to check if there are 2 player with the highest number of total goal ian robin (27) is one of them and chris topping (0) another.\",\n  \"Step4: As per our table data analysis in step 3, it's clear that 'ian robin' has played more than one league match whereas chris topping hasn't, so he could never be the second highest scorer for total goals given there will always be at least 1 player having higher or equal score.\",\n  \"Step5: Now let us check if any other player has scored a total goal higher than IAN Robin's (27). This is possible as we have 2 players who still could potentially top IAN robin.\",\n  \"Step6: By observing that both chris topping and ian robin have scores of zero in some categories, the highest scoring player must be one of those having score >0.\",\n  \"Step7: According to our final observation in step 5, if any other player also had same or greater than IAN Robin's total score then it would mean that there are more than two players with highest number of goals.\",\n  \"Step8: Finally, we can conclude based on the fact that we could not find another player with a higher score.\"\n],\n\"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n  {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n]",
