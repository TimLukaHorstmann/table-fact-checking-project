Extract the method of the TKO win: Check if this row in the \"method\" column contains the string \"TKO (punches)\" or \"TKO\", as these are typical indicators of a TKO win.\n\n4. Count how many people have a TKO win: Iterate over all rows where \"res\" equals \"win\". For each row, check if the method is either \"TKO (punches)\" or \"TKO\".

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I will go through each row in the table to determine if a fight was decided unanimously.\n\n2. For each row where a method of decision is provided (decision, tko, submission, ko, corner stoppage), I will check if all three judges scored the same for that round. If they did, it means the fight was decided unanimously.\n\n3. Next, I will go through the table again and extract the rows where a fight was decided unanimously.\n\n4. After extracting those rows, I will count how many fights were decided unanimously.\n\n5. Since the claim says there is only one fight that was decided unanimously, I will compare my count with 1.\n\n6. If the number of fights decided unanimously equals 1, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n\nHere is a list of all the relevant cells for this process:\n| row_index | column_name   |\n|:----------|:---------------|\n| 0         | event          |\n| 2         | method         |\n| 3         | round          |\n| 5         | time           |\n\n| row_index | column_name   |\n|:----------|:---------------|\n| 1         | method         |\n| 2         | method         |\n| 4         | method         |\n| 6         | method         |\n| 7         | method         |\n| 8         | method         |\n| 9         | method         |\n| 10        | method         |\n| 11        | method         |\n| 13        | method         |\n| 14        | method         |\n| 15        | method         |\n| 16        | method         |\n| 17        | method         |\n| 18        | method         |\n| 20        | method         |\n| 22        | method         |\n| 23        | method         |\n| 24        | method         |\n| 25        | method         |\n| 27        | method         |\n\n| row_index | column_name   |\n|:----------|:---------------|\n| 1         | round          |\n| 4         | round          |\n| 6         | round          |\n| 9         | round          |\n| 13        | round          |\n| 15        | round          |\n| 16        | round          |\n| 18        | round          |\n| 20        | round          |\n| 22        | round          |\n| 25        | round          |\n| 27        | round          |\n\nSince row 1, 5, and 9 are not in the \"round\" column, they cannot be counted.
