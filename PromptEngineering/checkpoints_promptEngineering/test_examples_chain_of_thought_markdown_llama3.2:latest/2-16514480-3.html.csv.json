    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps for determining whether the claim about Greg Norman is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, let's examine the relevant information from the table:\n\t* Greg Norman's place: 1\n\t* Greg Norman's country: Australia\n\t* Greg Norman's score: 63 + 69 = 132\n\t* Greg Norman's to par: -12\n2. Next, we need to check if Greg Norman is listed as playing for Australia and having a stroke-to-par of -12:\n\t* According to the table, Greg Norman's country is indeed \"australia\", which matches the claim.\n\t* Additionally, his score (132) minus 12 equals 120, but according to the text in cell (1), this was calculated as \"63 + 69 = 132\". This makes it unclear if it is -12 or actually 120 since there's an addition sign before 12. However, without additional context, we assume that is the case and Greg Norman is listed with a score that shows he had a stroke to par of -12.\n3. Now let's examine other relevant information from the table:\n\t* The cell for place \"1\" does not explicitly state \"australia\", it just says \"greg norman\". This makes the claim unclear, as the word 'australia' could be part of his name or simply indicate he is Australian.\n4. Lastly, we see that Greg Norman's score (132) minus 12 indeed equals 120, not -12. Thus the claim does contain an inaccuracy, specifically regarding whether it was a stroke to par of -12.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"examine relevant information from table\",\n      \"text\": \"Greg Norman's place: 1, Greg Norman's country: Australia, Greg Norman's score: 63 + 69 = 132, Greg Norman's to par: -12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"check if Greg Norman is listed as playing for Australia and having a stroke-to-par of -12\",\n      \"text\": \"according to table, greg norman's country is indeed australia, which matches the claim. additionally, his score (132) minus 12 equals 120\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"examine other relevant information from table\",\n      \"text\": \"the cell for place \\\"1\\\" does not explicitly state \\\"australia\\\", it just says greg norman.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"lastly, we see that Greg Norman's score (132) minus 12 indeed equals 120, not -12.\",\n      \"text\": \"thus the claim does contain an inaccuracy, specifically regarding whether it was a stroke to par of -12\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"-\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"-\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if David Frost is from South Africa: According to the table, David Frost's country of origin is indeed listed as \"south africa\".\n\n2. Check if Vijay Singh is from Fiji: Similarly, according to the table, Vijay Singh's country of origin is listed as \"fiji\".\n\n3. Verify that no other player has a different country listed in the \"country\" column for their score row, aside from David Frost and Vijay Singh.\n\nSince both David Frost and Vijay Singh have been found to be players with correct nationalities associated with their respective scores, but we only need one player (no more than one) to confirm the claim that there is no other player who plays for South Africa or Fiji aside from them. However the table does say he is tied with Phil Mickelson.\n\n4. Check if Phil Mickelson's country of origin matches his score row: According to the table, Phil Mickelson's country of origin is listed as \"united states\".\n\nSince Phil Mickelson's country of origin does not match the claim that he plays for Fiji or South Africa, and there are no other players in the relevant rows who play for Fiji but are different from Vijay Singh.\n\n5. Verify that David Frost and Vijay Singh have not played together or with any other player in another score row than the one mentioned above: Since this cannot be confirmed or denied based on the provided information (there is insufficient data), we must rely solely on steps 1, 2, and 4 to guide us.\n\n6. The claim says that David Frost \"be\" the only player list who \"be play for south africa\", which suggests a statement that might not necessarily be true in any other context outside of this table but is relevant here because he was confirmed as from South Africa.\n\n7.

Let's move to the next step.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the truth of the second part of the claim\nTo determine if Lee Janzen played for Fiji, we need to check the relevant cells:\n\n| place   | player         | country       | score         | to par   |\n|:--------|:---------------|:--------------|:--------------|:---------|\n| t5      | lee janzen     | united states | 68 + 71 = 139 | - 5      |\n\nWe can see that Lee Janzen played for the United States, not Fiji.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the truth of the entire claim\nSince Ian Woosnam did not play for South Africa and Lee Janzen did not play for Fiji, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1.
