Games 62 and 63 both have scores close to but less than 86, with score 4-7 and 1-3 respectively.\n\n### Step 5: Check the last column to verify\nWe then verify that there are no other games at row index 61 with more points.\n\n### Step 6: Finalize answer based on steps taken\nConsidering our findings from step 4 and step 5, we see that game 61 is indeed one of three games in the table with a total score of 86 points.

First, we need to identify the relevant information provided by the table regarding the game with the highest total score.\n   The claim states that the Winnipeg Jet played a game with a score of 8 - 4, so we need to verify this.\n\n2.

Next, we need to verify that there is no other game with a higher total score than the one involving the Winnipeg Jets.\n   This requires comparing the scores for all games:\n   | row_index | column_name          |\n   |-----------:|----------------------|\n   | 58        | february             |\n   | 58        | opponent              |\n   | 58        | score                |\n   | 58        | record               |\n   | 58        | points               |\n\n   For the game with the Montreal Canadiens, the score is 3 - 5. This is lower than the score for the Winnipeg Jets.\n\n4. Next, we need to compare scores from all other games:\n   We can see that there are some games with higher scores, but none of these involve the Winnipeg Jets.\n\n5.

The score is located in column \"score\".\n3. **Extract scores**: Extract the values from columns \"february\" that correspond to games 61 and 60. These are the row indexes 22 and 20, respectively.\n4. **Calculate difference**: Calculate the difference between the points scored by game 61 and game 60. This will be used to determine if the claim is true or false.\n5. **Compare with claim**: Compare this calculated difference with the value stated in the claim (10).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\nLet's perform these steps with actual data from the table.\n\n1. Locate the scores for games 61 and 60:\n   - Game 61 score: 3 - 1 = 86 points\n   - Game 60 score: 5 - 3 = 8 points\n\n2. Extract relevant row indexes:\n   - Row index for game 61 (february): 22\n   - Row index for game 60 (february): 20\n\n3. Calculate the difference in points between games 61 and 60:\n   - Difference = Score of game 61 - Score of game 60 = 86 - 8 = 78 points\n\n4. Compare this difference with the claim:\n\nSince the calculated difference is not equal to 10, we need to check if there was an error in our calculation or if the claim should actually be interpreted differently.\n\nHowever, given that the difference (78) is exactly 10 more than zero and does indeed exceed the stated difference by a positive value, this suggests that our initial interpretation may have been slightly off because we are looking at the actual numerical difference rather than the absolute difference from an arbitrary baseline. But mathematically, it's correct to say it's 10 points more than what would be necessary just for the score of game 60 alone.\n\nSo, based on the given claim that \"game 61 total 10 more point than game 60\" (interpretation might lean towards being directly interpretable as is without additional context), our step-by-step shows we have indeed identified and compared correctly but perhaps with a slight nuance in wording or interpretation needed for clarity.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim as true or false based on the table data.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate relevant data (scores for games 61 and 60) in column 'score'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Extract row indexes corresponding to games 61 and 60 from column 'february'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate the difference between scores of game 61 and game 60.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that according to our calculations and comparisons, the claim is false.",
