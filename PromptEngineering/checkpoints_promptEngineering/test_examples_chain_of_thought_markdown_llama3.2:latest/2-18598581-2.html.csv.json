This means we need to find all instances where a round's result includes at least one side having a score of 3.\n\n### Step 2: Look for relevant rows in the table\nWe will examine each row in the table to see if any rounds meet the criteria specified by the claim. We start with the first column \"date\" and move right, examining each subsequent column.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the first round (31 january 1885)\nIn this round, \"h / a\" is listed as h (home), which means one side had a higher score than the other in that match. However, neither side ended with a score of exactly 3; they both ended with scores of 2 and 3 respectively. So, we move on.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the first replay round (14 february 1885)\nThis round also had one side end up winning but the score wasn't an exact 3 for either team since it's a replay and was played at neutral. We continue to the next row.\n\n### Step 5: Examine the second round (7 march 1885)\nIn this instance, \"h / a\" is listed as a (away), meaning one side had a higher score in that match; again neither ended with an exact 3, we move on.\n\n### Step 6: Look at the semi-finals (18 april 1885)\nHere, \"h / a\" is Hurst (h) and Whalley Range (a), which indicates that in this match one side won but not exactly by having both sides end up with scores of exactly 3. So we continue.\n\n### Step 7: Inspect the final round (25 april 1885)\nIn this final, \"h / a\" is listed as Whalley Range (a) and Hurst (h), meaning one side ended up winning but neither had an exact score of 3 in their respective matches. So we're still not finding what the claim suggests.\n\n### Step 8: Check if any rounds meet the condition specified by the claim\nAfter reviewing all rows, there is no instance where both sides end up with a result that includes at least one side having exactly 3 as the final score for that round.\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"h / a\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"h / a\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"h / a\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"h / a\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"h / a\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"}\n  ]\n}",

Since there is more than one game with a result of 3, the claim cannot be true.\n4. However, we need to ensure that no single game has exactly 3 points as a result, not just 2 or 4. Looking at the table again:\n\t* April 18, 1885: 4 - 3 (aet) actually implies that Hurst scored more points than Dalton Hall Owens Col, it does not imply any of them had exactly 3.\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. To verify if Eccles is indeed the only opponent to play 2 times, we need to first identify all opponents who played exactly 2 times.\n2. We can do this by looking at the column \"round\" to find matches where the same opponent appears in two rows with different \"opponents\".\n3. The first row of Eccles is in round 1 and has a result of 3-2, which means it is not a replay (n).\n4. The second row for Eccles is a replay in round 1 against the same opponent Eccles, which indeed confirms that the opponent \"Eccles\" played 2 times.\n5. Now we must check if there are any other opponents who also appeared 2 times by checking columns like 'round' and see their opponents to ensure they only appear once.\n\n6. Looking at column \"round\", we can observe no other team appears twice in round 1 while also playing an opponent different from the initial one.\n7. To make sure of that, we check for any match in \"opponents\" with row_index equal to 0 and 'column_name' in ['round', 'opponents']. In this case, that is not the case.\n\n8. After verifying Eccles was indeed the only opponent to appear twice while playing a different team, we can confirm if that matches the claim stated.\n\n9. If Eccles did not meet this condition, we would have found another opponent who played 2 times with a unique opponent and thus would need to return FALSE.\n10. Since no other opponent fits this requirement, our answer is TRUE.\n\n11.
