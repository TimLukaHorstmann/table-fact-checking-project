The first row of Class 253 is from 1975-1977, so we cannot consider this row since it's before BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region started operating (from 1977).\n4. Next, we look at the second row of Class 253, which is from 1978-1979. This interval also does not overlap with the years that BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region operated.\n5. Now, we consider the third row for Class 253, which is from 1981-1982. The year built in this row (1982) matches one of the years specified in the \"year built\" column for BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region. This means BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region must have operated after this interval.\n6. We need to find out if Class 253 is still being used by BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region, which can be determined by looking at the value of \"cars per set\" and \"unit numbers\".

Nevertheless, considering that a train operator must have at least one train set to be considered the last, and since the \"cars per set\" column only has non-zero values starting from row 4 for BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region (which means it started operating with more than 9 cars), we can safely say Class 253 is still used by BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region.\n8. Therefore, to verify that BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region was the last operator of Class 253 British Rail, since there is no row after the third row where \"year built\" equals or exceeds the year in the relevant cell for BR Eastern Region Br Scottish Region (1982), we cannot confirm this.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\":\"\"}\n  ]\n}",
