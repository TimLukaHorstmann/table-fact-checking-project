The first step is to identify the conditions specified in the claim: \"may 28 be the earliest date where the opponent be the d - back and the attendance be 39000\".\n2. We need to find a match for these conditions in the table.\n3. Looking at the relevant columns in the table, we see that the date is in column \"date\", the opponent is in column \"opponent\", and the attendance is in column \"attendance\".\n4. For the condition \"may 28\" to be met, we need to check if there's a row where the date is \"may 28\".\n5. After finding a match for this specific date, we then need to verify that both conditions (\"opponent be the d - back\" and \"attendance be 39000\") are also met.\n6. To find all rows with opponent being \"d - backs\", we will look at column \"opponent\" for these values in combination with row index equal to 28, since it is specified we want earliest date matching \"may 28\".\n7. For the attendance value of 39000, we need to verify if there are multiple instances where this condition matches.\n8.

If no match is found for a date with a record of (18 - 8), then the claim can be confirmed as TRUE.\n\n5. We must also confirm that may 11th has only one instance in the table where the record and score match this specific value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n1. Looking at the table, we see that there is indeed a date on may 11 with a loss by falkenborg (0 - 1) but no other entries having both a record of 18 - 8 and a score of 3 - 2 except for the loss by eischen (0 - 1).\n\n2. We check if any scores match 3 - 2 with record 19 - 8 on may 2, which does not exist.\n\n3. Next we verify that there are no other entries where both record and score equal the given values at any date before or after may 11th.\n\n4. After reviewing all dates, it is confirmed that only one instance of a 3 - 2 win occurs with the specific record value (18 - 8) on may 11th without matches for either record or score elsewhere in the table.\n\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Check if record exists before may 11th\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Verify no other scores with the exact match (18 - 8) and score of 3 - 2, for any date after or before may 11th.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Confirm there is a single instance on may 11th\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This can be done by comparing the score in each row to determine if there are any matches.\n\n### Step 3: Verify opponent for other dates\nFor each date found in step 2, verify that the opponent is indeed \"tigers\".\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the specified date\nCompare the results from steps 2 and 3 with the specified date \"may 3\". If no other matches exist, then \"may 3\" is the only date where the score is \"7 - 3\" and the opponent is \"tigers\".\n\n### Step 5: List relevant cells\nCreate a list of all relevant cells that support or refute the claim. These include rows from the table where the score is \"7 - 3\" and the opponent is \"tigers\", as well as any other rows where the score is \"7 - 3\" to verify if \"may 3\" is indeed the only match.\n\n### Step 6: Compile final answer\nUsing the results from steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, compile a JSON object that includes the chain of thought, the final answer (TRUE or FALSE), and a list of relevant cells.\n\nHere's how to implement these steps in Python code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame from the markdown table\ndata = {\n    \"date\": [\"may 1\", \"may 2\", \"may 3\", \"may 4\", \"may 5\", \"may 6\", \"may 7\", \"may 9\", \"may 10\", \"may 11\", \"may 12\", \"may 13\", \"may 14\", \"may 16\", \"may 17\", \"may 18\", \"may 19\", \"may 20\", \"may 21\", \"may 22\", \"may 23\", \"may 24\", \"may 26\", \"may 27\", \"may 28\", \"may 29\", \"may 30\", \"may 31\"],\n    \"opponent\": [\"cardinals\", \"cardinals\", \"rockies\", \"rockies\", \"d-backs\", \"d-backs\", \"d-backs\", \"nationals\", \"nationals\", \"nationals\", \"phillies\", \"phillies\", \"phillies\", \"pirates\", \"pirates\", \"pirates\", \"tigers\", \"tigers\", \"tigers\", \"brewers\", \"brewers\", \"brewers\", \"d-backs\", \"d-backs\", \"cubs\", \"cubs\", \"cubs\"],\n    \"score\": [\"6 - 1\", \"3 - 2\", \"3 - 0\", \"7 - 1\", \"7 - 1\", \"3 - 1\", \"9 - 8\", \"7 - 1\", \"9 - 6\", \"5 - 4\", \"8 - 4\", \"2 - 0\", \"2 - 1\", \"9 - 3\", \"7 - 2\", \"9 - 8\", \"9 - 4\", \"7 - 6\", \"3 - 2\", \"7 - 3\", \"8 - 3\", \"3 - 2\", \"7 - 3\", \"5 - 4\", \"7 - 3\", \"8 - 3\", \"3 - 2\"],\n    \"relevant_opponent\": [\"tigers\", \"rockies\", \"tigers\", \"rockies\", \"d-backs\", \"d-backs\", \"d-backs\", \"nationals\", \"nationals\", \"nationals\", \"phillies\", \"phillies\", \"phillies\", \"tigers\", \"pirates\", \"pirates\", \"tigers\", \"tigers\", \"tigers\", \"brewers\", \"brewers\", \"brewers\", \"d-backs\", \"cubs\", \"cubs\", \"cubs\", \"cubs\", \"cubs\"]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Check if the score is 7 - 3 and opponent is tigers for each date\nrelevant_cells = df[(df[\"score\"] == \"7 - 3\") & (df[\"opponent\"] == \"tigers\")]\n\n# If no matches other than \"may 3\", then \"may 3\" is the only match\nif len(relevant_cells) == 1 and relevant_cells.index[0] == \"may 3\":\n    answer = {\n        \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked if score was '7 - 3' and opponent was 'tigers' for each date.

This means we need to check if there is only one instance of a score of 7 - 3 in the table on May 2nd.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant row(s) in the table**: We need to find the row corresponding to May 2, which is:\n   ```\n| date   | opponent   | score   | loss               |   attendance | record   |\n|:-------|:-----------|:--------|:-------------------|-------------:|:---------|\n| may 2  | cardinals  | 3 - 2   | falkenborg (0 - 1) |        25127 | 19 - 8   |\n```\n   \n3. **Check if the score on May 2 is exactly 7 - 3**: The score on May 2 is \"3 - 2\", not \"7 - 3\".
