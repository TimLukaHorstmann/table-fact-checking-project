However,\n- No other players are listed in the table with lower pick numbers than Anders Nilsson (62), except for simon bertilsson with pick number 87 and joonas nattinen with pick number 65.\n\n### Step 7: Determine final answer\nSince there are Swedish players whose pick number is less than 62, we can conclude that Anders Nilsson's pick number (62) does not meet the condition stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Understand the claim\",\n      \"step_number\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Identify players from Sweden\",\n      \"step_number\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"List players from Sweden\",\n      \"step_number\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Determine pick numbers for Swedish players\",\n      \"step_number\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Compare pick numbers\",\n      \"step_number\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Correct the comparison\",\n      \"step_number\": 6\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Determine final answer\",\n      \"step_number\": 7\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 62,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 65,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 87,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, we must recheck Taylor Beck's pick position, since his position being first doesn't necessarily mean he was picked before someone who has a lower pick number. For that, we need to look at how they were picked.\n\n4. **Check How They Were Picked**: We have to find the position of each player in order to see if it makes sense for them being chosen or not.\n\n- Taylor Beck's pick (70) is indeed higher than Ryan Howse's (74), so this would normally mean that Ryan was chosen first, therefore his order being 10th actually means he got picked after Taylor Beck. \n\n- However, we must recheck the position of both players in their respective picks since they are not simply picking numbers sequentially.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 70,\"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74,\"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70,\"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74,\"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}",
