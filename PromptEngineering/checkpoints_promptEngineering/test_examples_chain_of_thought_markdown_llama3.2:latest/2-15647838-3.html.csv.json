However, there is no \"Virginia Tech Hokies Bowl\" explicitly mentioned in the table. The actual bowl name mentioned for Virginia Tech is not listed, so I will find all the references of the word 'hokies' in the table and identify the relevant cell (s).\n\nStep 3: Find the \"hokies\" games\nLooking at the table, we can see that the words 'Hokies' are present in the column 'opponent'.

This means we need to find instances where there are 6 games played at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, TN, and verify if exactly two of those games were held.\n\n3.

However, the table does not directly mention \"Virginia Tech Hokies\" as a team name; it mentions teams that have participated in bowl games.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the data\nWe can see from the table that there are multiple teams listed, each with its own wins and losses.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the column names related to the claim.\nThe column names relevant to the claim are \"stadium\", which lists the stadiums where the bowl games were held, and \"location\", which lists the locations of those stadiums.\n\n#### Step 2: Check how many times each stadium is mentioned as being at Memphis Memorial Stadium.\nLooking through the table:\n- The column for attendance only shows the total attendance numbers for each game, not which stadium was used. So we can't directly count stadiums by attendance alone.\n- However, it\u2019s clear from the \"stadium\" and \u201clocation\u201d columns that there is no instance of either Memphis Memorial Stadium being listed as a different location than what's specified in the table (Memphis , TN).\n\n#### Step 3: Check if any bowl game was played at Memphis Memorial Stadium.\n\nUpon inspecting the relevant cells, I found:\n- Row index 2: opponent Cincinnati Bearcats and the stadium is Kidd Field which indicates it wasn't held at Memphis Memorial Stadium.\n \nTherefore, we don\u2019t have enough information to determine if any bowl games were indeed held there. \n\n#### Step 4: Check how many times \"Memphis , TN\" as a location was used in conjunction with the specified stadium.\n\nThe column for location is \u201clocation\u201d which lists locations of stadiums:\n- Row index 2: The opponent was Cincinnati Bearcats, at Kidd Field, and the location is El Paso , TX. It\u2019s clear from this that Memphis Memorial Stadium doesn\u2019t match the row.\n \nHowever, we see Memphis , TN used in conjunction with another stadium - Independence Stadium.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if any bowl game was held at an independent (not affiliated) stadium and then verify its attendance numbers to confirm the count of six games at that stadium. \n\nUpon inspecting the table again:\n- Row index 4: The opponent is Air Force Falcons, and the location of Independence Stadium is Shreveport , LA. So this row does indeed match - but we have another independent game in the table as well.\n \nHowever, looking at rows 8 & 11:\n- Row index 8: The opponent is Tennessee Volunteers, and the stadium is Georgia Dome which also matches with a different location than specified (Atlanta , GA). Since there was a different stadium used here - this row does not count toward our tally of six games.\n \nAnd then we have row index 11: The opponent is Stanford Cardinal, and the location of Sun Life Stadium is Miami Gardens , FL.\n\nUpon further inspection of rows 2 through 12:\n- We see that Memphis Memorial Stadium was never specified as a different stadium from what\u2019s listed in the table. This means there are no bowl games at that stadium, or any other than those mentioned explicitly.\n \nWe need to check if we can find another independent (non-affiliated) game and then check its attendance numbers.\n\nHowever, row index 5 & 9 do not use Memphis Memorial Stadium either:\n- Row index 5: The opponent is Florida State Seminoles at Louisiana Superdome which also does not use that name.\n \nAnd row index 9: Tennessee Volunteers at Georgia Dome.\n\n\nUpon re-checking rows 1 through 12, the only independent (non-affiliated) stadium mentioned in the table was Independence Stadium for a game held in Shreveport , LA - but this also used the different city's name as well. We could not find any other independent (non-affiliated) games at Memphis Memorial Stadium.\n\n\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n3 out of 20 games do indeed appear to be played at Memphis Memorial Stadium, according to the table.\n\nThe relevant cells for this calculation are:\n{\n    \"row_index\": [2, 9, 11],\n    \"column_name\": [\"stadium\", \"location\"]\n}\n\nAnd finally, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"First , we needed to identify the column names relevant to the claim. Then we looked for a row that used Memphis Memorial Stadium\u2019s name as its stadium and then found independent (non-affiliated) games at other stadiums. We could not find any other independent (non-affiliated) games at Memphis Memorial Stadium.
