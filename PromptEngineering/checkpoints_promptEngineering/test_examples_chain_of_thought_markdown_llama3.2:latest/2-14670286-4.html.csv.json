    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that between June 3, 2012 and June 8, 2012 (inclusive), there were 4 games for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n2. To determine if this is true, we need to look at the table and find the relevant matches.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that on June 3, 2012, Japan played a match against someone (not specified in the table), with no score or result given.\n4. On June 8, 2012, there are three rows for the same date:\n   * Row 25: \"8 june 2012            | saitama stadium 2002 , saitama            | 1 - 0                  | 6 - 0                  | 2014 fifa world cup qualification\"\n   * Row 26: \"8 june 2012            | saitama stadium 2002 , saitama            | 2 - 0                  | 6 - 0                  | 2014 fifa world cup qualification\"\n   * Row 27: \"8 june 2012            | saitama stadium 2002 , saitama            | 3 - 0                  | 6 - 0                  | 2014 fifa world cup qualification\"\n5. All three of these matches were for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, so this meets the condition of the claim.\n6. Additionally, on June 3, 2012, there is another match that has not been accounted for yet (row 24).\n7. Row 24: \"3 june 2012            | saitama stadium 2002 , saitama            | 1 - 0                  | 3 - 0                  | 2014 fifa world cup qualification\"\n8. This also meets the condition of the claim.\n9. Since both conditions in the claim are met, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
