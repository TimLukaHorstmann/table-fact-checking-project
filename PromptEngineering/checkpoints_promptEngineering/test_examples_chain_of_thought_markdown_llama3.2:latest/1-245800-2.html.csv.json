    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps for determining whether the claim about Salyut 6 - EO-1 and Salyut 6 - EP-1 crews is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the crew members of Salyut 6 - EO-1\nFrom the table, we can see that Salyut 6 - EO-1 has a crew consisting of Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko. Let's verify this information.\n\n### Step 2: Check if the claim states that Salyut 6 - EO-1 has a crew of Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko\nThe claim is \"expedition salyut 6 - eo - 1 have a crew of yuri romanenko georgi grechko\". This matches our verification in Step 1.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the crew members of Salyut 6 - EP-1\nFrom the table, we can see that Salyut 6 - EP-1 has a crew consisting of Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov. Let's verify this information.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the claim states that Salyut 6 - EP-1 has a crew of Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov\nThe claim is \"expedition salyut 6 - ep - 1 have a crew of vladimir dzhanibekov oleg makarov\". This also matches our verification in Step 3.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the truth value of the claim\nBased on Steps 2 and 4, both Salyut 6 - EO-1 and Salyut 6 - EP-1 have their respective crews correctly stated in the claim.

The relevant cell would be:\n```markdown\n| expedition        | ...         |   duration (days) |\n|:------------------|:------------|------------------:|\n| salyut 6 - eo - 1 | ...         |       96.42      |\n| salyut 6 - eo - 2 | ...         |       139.62      |\n| salyut 6 - eo - 4 | ...         |       184.84      |\n| ...                 | ...         |       ?          |\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare the duration of Salut 6 - EO-4 with other rows\nSince there is no more row after Salut 6 - EO-4 in the table, we need to check if the next longest expedition is indeed Salut 6 - EO-3. The relevant cell would be:\n```markdown\n| expedition        | ...         |   duration (days) |\n|:------------------|:------------|------------------:|\n| salyut 6 - eo - 1 | ...         |       96.42      |\n| salyut 6 - eo - 2 | ...         |       139.62      |\n| salyut 6 - eo - 4 | ...         |       184.84      |\n| salyut 6 - ep-3   | ...         |       175.02      |\n```\nThe duration of Salut 6 - EO-3 (175.02 days) is indeed greater than that of Salut 6 - EO-4 (184.84 days).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the validity of the claim\nSince the duration of Salut 6 - EO-3 is greater than that of Salut 6 - EO-4, we need to reevaluate if Salut 6 - EO-3 should be considered as the longest expedition or not. But in fact, this observation was made wrong. The actual next longest expedition after \"salyut 6 - eo - 4\" was found as \"salyut 6 - ep-3\", and then re-evaluate its position.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with other rows\nAfter finding the row of Salut 6 - EO-4, we need to check if there are any other expedition that have a duration greater than 184.84 days in order to determine if the claim is correct.\n```markdown\n| expedition        | ...         |   duration (days) |\n|:------------------|:------------|------------------:|\n| salyut 6 - eo - 1 | ...         |       96.42      |\n| salyut 6 - eo - 2 | ...         |       139.62      |\n| salyut 6 - eo - 4 | ...         |       184.84      |\n| salyut 6 - ep-3   | ...         |       175.02      |\n| salyut 6 - ep-5    | ...         |       7.87        |\n| salyut 6 - eo - 5 | ...         |       12.8         |\n```\nAfter the comparison, it is found that \"salyut 6 -eo-4\" has a longer duration than any other expedition in table.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the validity of the claim\nBased on step 5, since no other expedition with greater duration was found, and Salut 6 - EO-3 does have less duration, we conclude that the claim is wrong.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Identify the claim\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Find the row with the maximum duration for \\\"expedition\\\" = \\\"salyut 6 - eo\\\"\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Compare the duration of Salut 6 - EO-4 with other rows\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Determine the validity of the claim\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"5: Compare with other rows\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \\\"FALSE\\\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"expedition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about Yuri Romanenko being a member of both the flight up Soyuz T-4 crew and the flight up Soyuz T-6 crew:\n\n1. First, we need to find the relevant rows in the table that contain information about Yuri Romanenko's flights.\n2. For each row with information about Yuri Romanenko, check if it includes \"soyuz t - 4\" or \"soyuz t - 6\" in the \"flight up\" column.\n3. If a row contains both \"soyuz t - 4\" and \"soyuz t - 6\", then we need to verify that Yuri Romanenko is listed as a crew member for both flights.\n4. Check the \"crew\" column for each relevant row to see if Yuri Romanenko is listed.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n* Row 1: salyut 6 - eo - 2 has \"soyuz 26\" in the \"flight up\" column, not \"soyuz t - 4\" or \"soyuz t - 6\". So, this row is not relevant.\n* Row 8: salyut 6 - ep - 8 has \"soyuz 38\" in the \"flight up\" column, which does not match. However, we can see that Yuri Romanenko is listed as a crew member for this flight (along with Arnaldo Tamayo M\u00e9ndez).\n* Row 5: salyut 6 - eo - 1 has \"soyuz 26\" in the \"flight up\" column, and Yuri Romanenko is listed as a crew member. However, we also need to check if he is on Soyuz T-4 or T-6.\n* We can see that Row 5 contains information about the flight up (Soyuz 26), but it does not contain any information about Soyuz T-4 or T-6. This means that while Yuri Romanenko is a crew member for this particular Soyuz, we cannot confirm if he was part of the Soyuz T-4 or T-6 crew.\n\nNow, let's combine these observations to create our output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"1.
