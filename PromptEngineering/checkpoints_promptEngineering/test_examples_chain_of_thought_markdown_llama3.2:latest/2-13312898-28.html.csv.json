However, there is another one - Wes Roberts was picked at index 170.\n\nSo, there's only one player mentioned who was indeed picked in the 2nd round of the draft.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Claim\nSince there's only one player mentioned and he was indeed selected in the 2nd round, we can evaluate the claim as follows:\n- The claim does not say \"5 players.\" Therefore, it is about at least one pick.\n- It does specify that a player be picked in \"the 2nd round of the draft.\"\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nWith these details in mind, we're affirming whether or not this single occurrence meets our criteria.\n\nGiven there's only one instance and no mention of '5' players in total, our assertion is straightforward based on the claim itself.

Looking at the table, we can identify relevant rows:\n   * Round 1: Pick 5 - curtis dickey (running back)\n   * Round 4: Pick 88 - ray butler (wide receiver) is not a running back, skip this row.\n   * Round 6: Pick 144 - chris foote (center) is not a running back, skip this row.\n   * Round 9: Pick 227 - mark bright (running back)\n4. Now we have two running backs picked in the first five rounds:\n   * curtis dickey (round 1, pick 5)\n   * mark bright (round 9, pick 227) is not by the 6th round.\n   * We need to continue to find another one.\n\n5. Since there are at least two running back picks in rounds before the 6th round, we have to look at all rows for \"running back\" position to see if more exist after the first five rounds and be within the range of the 6th.\n   * Round 10: Pick 254 - larry stewart (offensive tackle) is not a running back, skip this row.\n   * Round 11: Pick 280 - ed whitley (tight end) is not a running back, skip this row.\n   * Round 12: Pick 324 - marvin sims (fullback) is a running back.\n\n6. We found two running back picks before the 6th round but did not find one by the 6th round that meets the criteria exactly as written.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Verify claim about 3 run backs in the 6th round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Find all rows with position \\\"running back\\\" and pick number less than or equal to 144 (the 6th round)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Look at specific row: Round 1, Pick 5 - curtis dickey (running back), the only running back in round one\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Continue looking for more run backs\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Round 4, Pick 88 - ray butler is not a running back, skip this row.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Round 6, Pick 144 - chris foote (center), not a running back, skip this row.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Round 9, Pick 227 - mark bright (running back) is outside the 6th round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Still looking for another one after the first five rounds\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Round 10: Skip this row since it says offensive tackle not running back\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Round 11: Skip this row since it says tight end, not running back.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Round 12: Pick 324 - marvin sims (fullback) is a running back.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
