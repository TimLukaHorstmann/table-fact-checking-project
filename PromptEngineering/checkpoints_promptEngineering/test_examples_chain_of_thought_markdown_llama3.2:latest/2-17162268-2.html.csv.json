    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that Jack Nicklaus, who is from the United States, has won the most years since 1962 to 1980.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check the number of years Jack Nicklaus has won since 1962.\n3. Looking at the table, we find Jack Nicklaus's row with his player name as \"jack nicklaus\" and country as \"united states\".\n4. The relevant columns are:\n   - `year (s) won`: This column shows the years in which Jack Nicklaus has won the tournament.\n   - `total`: This is the total number of wins for each player, but we're not interested in this for now.\n5. From 1962 to 1980, Jack Nicklaus's winning years are: 1962, 1967, 1972, and 1980. That makes 4 years.\n6. The claim also mentions that \"australia\" is part of the player's country, but we've already established that this is incorrect since Jack Nicklaus is from the United States.\n7. Now, we need to see if there are any other players who have won more than 4 years between 1962 and 1980.\n8. Let's look at the `year (s) won` column for each player:\n   - David Graham has won in 1981 which is outside our range of interest.\n   - Hale Irwin has won in two different years but both are after our range of interest.\n9. Now let\u2019s compare the number of wins between Jack Nicklaus and Hale Irwin:\n    - Both have won for four separate years\n10. Therefore, since there is no player with more than 4 wins between 1962 to 1980 we can say that Jack Nicklaus has won the most years during this period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Claim states that jack nicklaus of australia have win the most year , expand from 1962 to 1980\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Verify number of wins between 1962 and 1980 for Jack Nicklaus\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Extract years won by Jack Nicklaus between 1962 and 1980\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Compare with other players in the table to find anyone who has won more than 4 years\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Both Hale Irwin and Jack Nicklaus have four wins during this period, so it cannot be said that one of them has won the most year\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}",
