The claim mentions Scott Jessee being a \"right wing.\" From the table, we confirm that his position is indeed \"right wing.\"\n\n4. Now, to verify if Scott Jessee was drafted last in the draft, we need to see which round he was selected in and whether there are any players left after him.\n\n5. We examine each row from Round 1 onwards (since drafting order typically follows a sequential order starting from Round 1) to find out who was drafted before or with Scott Jessee:\n\n|   round | player           | position   | nationality   | college / junior / club team (league)   |\n|--------:|:-----------------|:-----------|:--------------|:----------------------------------------|\n|       8 | steve short      | left wing  | united states | minnesota junior stars (mjhl)           |\n|       9 | peter mckenzie   | defense    | canada        | st francis xavier university ( ciau )   |\n|      10 | marcel labrosse  | center     | canada        | shawinigan dynamos (qmjhl)              |\n|      11 | scott jessee     | right wing | united states | michigan tech huskies ( wcha )          |\n|      12 | richard guay     | goaltender | canada        | chicoutimi saguen\u00e9ens (qmjhl)           |\n|      13 | brad morrow      | defense    | united states | minnesota golden gophers (wcha)         |\n|      14 | craig arvidson   | left wing  | united states | \u202aminnesota - duluth bulldogs (wcha)      |\n\n6. From the given rounds, we observe that Scott Jessee was selected in Round 11.\n\n7. To verify if he was drafted last in the draft, we look for players drafted after him, particularly focusing on those before or in his same round:\n\n   - In Round 10, Marcel Labrosse was drafted.\n   \n   - No player was mentioned to be drafted after Scott Jessee up until Round 13.\n\n8. Based on this observation, it seems that by the time Scott Jessee's turn came (Round 11), he indeed could have been among the last selections in his round, as there aren't any players listed before or within Round 12 who were selected after him.\n\n9. Conclusion: Since we do not see a definitive \"last\" marker but given the absence of later picks in Scott Jessee's exact draft round, and understanding that being drafted \"last\" implies being the final selection without anyone else picked after him, it suggests his claim could be misleading or incorrect based on available data.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify Scott Jessee is a right wing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check which round Scott Jessee was drafted in and compare with the number of players after him in that round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look for any player drafted before or in Round 11\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
