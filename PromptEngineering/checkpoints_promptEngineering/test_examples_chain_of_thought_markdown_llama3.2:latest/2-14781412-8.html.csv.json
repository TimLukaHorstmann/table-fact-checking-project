Check if Nadia al - moutawaa won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games:\n   - Relevant cell:\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n     }\n   This returns true.\n\n2. Find another year when Nadia al - moutawaa won the silver medal.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0, \n       \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n     }\n   or\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1, \n       \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n     }\n\n  This returns false.\n\n3. Nadia al - moutawaa won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games and win silver another year is FALSE\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0, \n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1, \n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0, \n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1, \n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the year with an equestrian event**: We need to find at least two years where there is a gold medalist for equestrian. From the table, we can see that the equestrian events occurred in 1982, 1986, 2002, and 2010.\n\n2. **Compare the gold medalists between different years**: Now, let's compare the gold medalists from one year to another.\n   - In 1982 and 1986, we see that there is no equestrian event with the same gold medalist in both years.\n   - However, there are two exceptions: 1994 and 1998 where the gold medalist for equestrian happened to be the same person.\n\n3. **Analyze the claim**: The claim states that the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given our observation in step 2, we can see that there is indeed a case where the gold medalist was the same in two different years (1994 and 1998). However, this does not necessarily mean the claim is false since it also says \"except\" these years. This wording implies that if any of those years were included, then they would have been different.\n\n5. **Final analysis**: The statement \"except\" implies an exclusion. Since there are instances where the gold medalist was indeed the same but only mentioned to disallow specific instances (1994 and 1998), it means in all other cases, there has been a change in the gold medalist. Thus, given these considerations, the statement aligns more with truth, provided we don't count 1994 and 1998 as exceptions against the rule of being different.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify equestrian events\",\n      \"description\": \"Look for years where there is a gold medalist for equestrian\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare equestrian gold medalists between different years\",\n      \"description\": \"Check if the same person won in multiple years\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze claim with exceptions provided\",\n      \"description\": \"Consider the 'except' clause when evaluating the claim's truthfulness\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion based on analysis\",\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim is true or false given all steps\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
