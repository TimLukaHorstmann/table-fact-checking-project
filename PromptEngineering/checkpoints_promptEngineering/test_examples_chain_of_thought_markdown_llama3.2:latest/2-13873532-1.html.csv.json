We need to find Liu Song's ranking in both years.\n\n### Step 2: Find Liu Song's Ranking in 2010/2011\nLooking at the table, we see that Liu Song is ranked 62 in 2010/2011.\n\n### Step 3: Find Liu Song's Ranking in 2011/2012\nIn 2011/2012, Liu Song is ranked 65.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Difference and Check if it's Exactly 3 Ranks Lower\nThe difference between the two rankings is 65 - 62 = 3. This means that according to the table, in 2011/2012, Liu Song was indeed 3 ranks lower than in 2010/2011.\n\n### Step 5: Verify if the Difference is Exactly 3 Ranks Lower\nSince the difference is exactly 3 (65 - 62 = 3), we need to verify that this is indeed a ranking position difference. Looking at the table again, we see that there are no instances of Liu Song being ranked higher in 2011/2012 than he was in 2010/2011 by more than 3 ranks.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nBased on our step-by-step analysis, it appears that Liu Song's ranking position in 2011/2012 was indeed 3 ranks lower than in 2010/2011.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim and relevant information\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Find Liu Song's ranking in 2010/2011\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find Liu Song's ranking in 2011/2012\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate the difference and check if it's exactly 3 ranks lower\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Verify if the difference is exactly 3 ranks lower\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"2010 / 11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011 / 12\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Since it's not '53', we move on.\n        - Column 'lq' also contains \"liu song\". Its value for the row with index 6 is 'a'. It still isn't 53, so we move on to next column. \n        - The third occurrence of 'liu song' in column 'wr' has a value 'wr', and its ranking for that year should be verified.\n    - Column 'non-ranking tournaments' will also have \"liu song\". Its rank at row index 7 is \"a\", which isn't 53, so we move to the next step.\n\n5. **Verify ranking in the relevant column**: The final column 'wr' of \"liu song\" contains wr for index 6 and 7 but the actual rankings are not visible here; only values corresponding to each year are shown (i.e., a, lq, not held etc.) so we need to check if there is any row containing the ranking '53'.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: From our analysis above, it seems that \"liu song's\" best ranking was indeed in 2008/09, with value as 53.\n\n7. **Output answer**: The final output will be a JSON object that includes this reasoning process along with the actual answer to the problem posed.",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that Liu Song was ranked 40 places lower in the 2009-2010 season compared to the 2005-2006 season.\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant data for 2005/06\nWe need to look at the ranking tournament data for 2005/06. According to the table, Liu Song's ranking in 2005/06 was \"a\".\n\n### Step 3: Calculate target ranking for 2009/10\nIf Liu Song was ranked 40 places lower than his 2005/06 ranking, then his target ranking would be \"a\" + 40 = \"qf\". However, according to the table, his actual ranking in 2009/10 was not directly available. But we can find his position in the tournament from other columns.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Liu Song's position in 2009/10\nLooking at the \"non-ranking tournaments\" column for 2009/10, it is given that Liu Song played in a variant format tournament. The actual ranking data is not provided there; however, we can check the \"former non-ranking tournaments\" column which tells us his performance in the previous season's non-rankings. Then we need to go into the lq column (lost in qualifying) and 1r columns to figure out if he was ranked in a different tournament within that particular season.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with actual ranking\nThe table does not explicitly state Liu Song's ranking in 2009/10, but based on previous rounds in the same tournament series (where we found lq or nr), it can be inferred his performance in 2009-2010 was poor. The only available info for non-ranking tournaments is \"not held\", which means he didn't participate, and thus cannot be ranked at that stage.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze ranking position change\nWithout explicit rankings data for 2009/10 season from official table sources, it's hard to directly calculate the rank difference. But as mentioned before, if we only look into non-ranking tournaments, his performance in those is \"not held\" (in a variant format), which does not inform us of ranking status in that round.\n\n### Step 7: Deduce answer based on available data\nSince no official ranking information for Liu Song's participation in the 2009/10 tournament season exists within our data sources, we can conclude his performance was at least poor or \"lost in qualifying\" (lq). However, without concrete numbers or rankings from those events, determining an exact position or difference relative to 2005-06 is not feasible with given details. Given the claim requires precise ranking number difference (\"40 places lower\") and our inability to find such information in the table for a comparative ranking between two seasons, we must assess if the provided data supports the assertion directly.\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nGiven the lack of explicit ranking data for 2009/10 and only \"not held\" (or lq) performance details in non-rankings tournaments for that season, it's challenging to affirmatively state Liu Song was indeed 40 places lower than his 2005-06 ranking. Thus, based solely on provided table information without further context or comparative rankings data from official sources, we cannot definitively answer the claim as TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Understand the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim states that Liu Song was ranked 40 places lower in the 2009-2010 season compared to the 2005-2006 season.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant data for 2005/06\",\n      \"description\": \"We need to look at the ranking tournament data for 2005/06.
