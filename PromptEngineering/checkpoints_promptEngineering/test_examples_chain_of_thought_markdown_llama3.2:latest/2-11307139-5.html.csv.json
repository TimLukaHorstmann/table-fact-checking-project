Next, we need to confirm that Wozniak won exactly three of these tournaments in 2005.\n   From the table above, it's clear that Wozniak competed in two tournaments (victoria and mexico city), but won only one of them.\n\n3.

However, since Wozniak is not mentioned anywhere in the table, we should look for any other player with a similar name or an alias that could be associated with Wozniak.\n\n3. **Check the table**: After re-examining the table, we notice that there are two players with surnames containing \"W\" (Wozniak and Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1).

We then need to count the number of instances where the opponent's name matches with Wozniak (presumably Agnieszka Wozniacka).

    "resp": "### Claim Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the total number of years between 2002 and 2012.\nTo analyze the claim, we first need to calculate the total number of years between the start year (2002) and the end year (2012). This will give us a baseline for our analysis.\n\n```markdown\n# Total years\nStart Year: 2002\nEnd Year: 2012\n\nTotal Years = End Year - Start Year\nTotal Years = 2012 - 2002\nTotal Years = 10\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Identify all instances of Wozniak losing between the given years.\nNext, we need to identify any matches where Wozniak is listed as having lost. We'll examine each row in the table and check if Wozniak's opponent is listed in a \"winner\" cell.\n\n```markdown\n# Step 2: Check losses for Wozniak\n- June 30, 2002 (hard): Lost to Beier Ko\n- July 17, 2005 (clay): Lost to Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri\n- October 23, 2005 (hard): Lost to Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri\n- November 12, 2006 (hard): Retired against Victoria Azarenka\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Count the total number of losses for Wozniak.\nWe need to count how many times Wozniak is listed as having lost in our analysis.\n\n```markdown\n# Number of losses\nTotal Losses = Count instances where Wozniak's opponent won\nTotal Losses = 4\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if the claim that Wozniak has lost 9 times between 2002 and 2012 is true.\nNow, we compare our total count of losses for Wozniak to the number specified in the claim (9).\n\n```markdown\n# Claim analysis\nClaim = \"Wozniak have lose 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012\"\nAnswer = Total Losses == 9 ? TRUE : FALSE\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Output the final answer in JSON format.\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Total years between start year and end year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Identify all instances of Wozniak losing.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count the total number of losses for Wozniak.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim that Wozniak has lost 9 times between 2002 and 2012 is true.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": FALSE,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Total years between start year and end year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Identify all instances of Wozniak losing.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count the total number of losses for Wozniak.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim that Wozniak has lost 9 times between 2002 and 2012 is true.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": FALSE,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
