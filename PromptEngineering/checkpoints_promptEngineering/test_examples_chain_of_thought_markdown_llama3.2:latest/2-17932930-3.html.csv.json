Review the definition of a transfer window: A transfer window refers to the period during which a player can be bought or sold by a club.\n2. Analyze the table structure: The table shows various details about players, including their name, nationality, team they are moving to, type of move (transfer or loaned out), and the transfer window associated with that move.\n3. Identify the claim's condition: The claim states \"every transfer window be in the season of winter.\"\n4. Look for transfer windows outside of the winter season: Check if there is at least one transfer window not during the winter season.\n\nUpon reviewing the table, I found a transfer window listed as \"winter\" which does not necessarily indicate that it occurred during the winter season (only its name suggests so), but more importantly, another column (\"transfer\") contains information on when such transfers were made. Specifically, this is in a column labeled \"per\", row 4 where the cell values are:\n| nat   | name      | moving to        | type       | transfer window   |\n|:------|:----------|:-----------------|:-----------|:------------------|\n| per   | correa    | melgar           | loaned out | winter            |\n\nThe relevant details here are that there exists a case of \"transfer window\" being listed as 'winter', in the context of this specific table, but to see if every transfer window is indeed during the winter season we must also look at what type of transfers were made. Given this data the value \"winter\" for all these cells suggests they occurred between July 1st and January 31st in their respective calendar years.\n\nSince there are only two relevant transfer windows (\"per\" row index values) with a single column labeled as 'transfer window', and one is 'winter', it cannot be stated that every transfer window was indeed during the winter season.",

Also, it appears that there was a move before the one mentioned for 2008.\n\n4. **Check Curiel's information**:\n   - Similarly, Curiel is also mentioned with Alianza Atl\u00e9tico in both transfer types but again only during the winter window, and like V Zapata, we need to know if this move happened in 2008.\n\n5. **Identify a discrepancy**: The table does not specify the year of any loan or transfer for either player.
