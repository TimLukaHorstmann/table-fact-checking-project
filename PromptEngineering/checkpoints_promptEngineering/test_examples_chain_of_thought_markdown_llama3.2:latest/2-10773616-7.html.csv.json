    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the teams mentioned in the claim**: The claim mentions two teams, North Melbourne and Footscray.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant scores in the table**:\n   - For North Melbourne, we need to find the home team score where \"north melbourne\" is present in the `home_team` column.\n   - For Footscray, we need to find the away team score where \"footscray\" is present in the `away_team` column.\n\n3. **Find North Melbourne's score**:\n   Looking at the table, we see that North Melbourne played as both the home and away teams. However, we're only interested in their score when they were the away team (since this is the context of the claim). We can find North Melbourne's away score by looking for a row where \"north melbourne\" appears in the `away_team` column.\n\n4. **Find Footscray's score**:\n   Similarly, we're only interested in Footscray's score when they were the home team (as this is how the claim will be true). We can find Footscray's home score by looking for a row where \"footscray\" appears in the `home_team` column.\n\n5. **Check if North Melbourne won by less than 70 points**:\n   - The away score for North Melbourne is 9.24 (78).\n   - To win by less than 70 points, we need to check if 78 < 70 + 11 = 81 or 78 itself is less than 70. Clearly, it's the latter.\n   Hence, North Melbourne won by a margin of 9.24 (78) which is indeed less than 70.\n\n6. **Check if Footscray won by less than 70 points**:\n   - The home score for Footscray is 11.12 (78).\n   - To win by less than 70 points, we need to check if 78 < 70 + 11 = 81 or 78 itself is less than 70. Clearly, it's the latter.\n   Hence, Footscray won by a margin of 11.12 (78) which is indeed less than 70.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since both North Melbourne and Footscray won their matches with scores less than 70 points apart from the 70 point boundary condition being breached in the latter case but not in the former, the claim that \"north melbourne and footscray both win by score less than 70 point\" is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home_team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the teams involved**: The claim mentions three teams: Richmond, Collingwood, and Footscray.\n2. **Check the results**:\n   - Compare the scores of Richmond and Collingwood on May 29, 1954. According to the table, Collingwood scored 11.8 (74) while Richmond scored 14.13 (97). Since 74 is less than 97, Richmond won.\n3.  **Check Footscray's result**: Compare Footscray's score with Hawthorn's score on May 29, 1954. According to the table, Hawthorn scored 10.9 (69) while Footscray scored 11.12 (78). Since 78 is greater than 69, Footscray won.\n\n#### Chain of Thought:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Identify the teams involved\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Check the results.
