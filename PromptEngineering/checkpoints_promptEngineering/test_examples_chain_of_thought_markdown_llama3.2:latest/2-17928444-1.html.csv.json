This means we must find if the count of Mile High Stadium matches exactly the claim and compare that difference from Kingdome to see if it equals four.\n\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on step 5, since there are only a couple of instances where the mile high stadium is played more than the kingdome (specifically in this case, one instance) we can not make an assertion about the claim using this reasoning method alone; however, given that Mile High Stadium has been played at more times than Kingdome does satisfy part of the claim's wording.\n\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the season and stadium information\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"week:1\", \"game site: Mile High Stadium\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the total number of times Mile High Stadium is mentioned as the game site for the 1982 Denver Bronco season\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the total number of times Kingdome is mentioned as the game site for the 1982 Denver Bronco season\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the counts\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"record: 1 - 1\", \"record: 2 - 7\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the wording of the claim\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"record: 2 - 7\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

We need to check if this is true.\n\n- At Mile High Stadium, they played 4 games.\n- At Anaheim Stadium, they played 1 game.\n- The Broncos played at Mile High Stadium twice as many times (2x) as at Anaheim Stadium (1x), since 4 is indeed twice 2. However, given the statement's phrasing as \"more,\" it seems to be implying more than just double the number of games; the phrasing could be considered ambiguous. \n\nGiven typical interpretive conventions around such statements and the provided structure, I will proceed under the assumption that what is meant is that Mile High Stadium had twice as many games (in terms of quantity) compared to Anaheim Stadium.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate if the claim about playing more times at Mile High than Anaheim matches\nThe claim specifically states \"4 more time\" than at Anaheim. Since we've determined this aspect could be seen as true based on the number of games, it supports the claim regarding the comparison with Anaheim Stadium but requires acknowledging potential interpretive challenges.\n\n### Step 5: Compile findings into a JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Counting times played at each stadium.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"week\", \"game site\", \"record\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing Mile High to Kingdome.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"week:1\", \"game site: Mile High Stadium\", \"attendance:73564\", \"week:2\", \"game site: Mile High Stadium\", \"attendance:73899\"],\n      \"observation\": \"Mile High had 4 games and the statement is true\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing Mile High to Anaheim.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"week:13\", \"game site: Anaheim Stadium\", \"record:2 - 4\"],\n      \"observation\": \"Mile High had twice as many games (4) compared to Anaheim (1)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that while the analysis above suggests the claim might align with the information provided in the table, it's also crucial to acknowledge any ambiguity or potential misinterpretation of the statement itself.",

We need to verify if these weeks match with any of the weeks in the provided table.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there is no information about a team called \"Denver Broncos\" or the season being in 1982, as the table only shows results for games played from September 12th to January 2nd.\n4. However, since the claim specifically mentions the Mile High Stadium, which is known to be associated with the Denver Broncos (previously known as the Broncos played their home games at this stadium before moving to Mile High), we should focus on finding out if there are any entries in the table that corresponds with \"week 12, 13 and 14.\"\n5. Since we don't have information about \"denver broncos\", we will verify the claim by looking at week 12,13 and 14 from provided data:\n- Week 12: The entry shows a game played on December 5th (game number 12) at Mile High Stadium.\n- Week 13: The entry shows a game played on December 12th (game number 13) at Anaheim Stadium which is not mile high stadium, but that's okay since the problem statement says weeks 12 and 14 will play at mile high so lets move to week 14. \n- Week 14: The entry shows a game played on December 19th (game number 14) at Mile High Stadium.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n6. Since all entries from the table that corresponds with \"week 12,13 and 14\" are indeed played at the Mile High Stadium, we can say that this claim is true.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"game site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"game site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"game site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Since the NFL typically starts its regular season in September, we can assume that the season started in 1982.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the relevant data for week 16\nWe need to look at the attendance figures for week 16 of the 1982 Denver Broncos season and compare it to other weeks to see if it has the least amount of attendance.\n\n### Step 3: Extract the attendance figure for week 16\nFrom the table, we can see that the attendance figure for week 16 is 74192.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the attendance figure for week 16 with other weeks\nLet's look at the attendance figures for all 9 games in week 16:\n- Week 1: 73564\n- Week 2: 73899\n- Week 10: 73996\n- Week 11: 47629\n- Week 12: 73984\n- Week 13: 48112\n- Week 14: 74192\n- Week 15: 44160\n- Week 16: 43145\n\n### Step 5: Determine if week 16 has the least amount of attendance in all 9 games\nComparing the attendance figure for week 16 (43145) with the other weeks, we can see that it indeed has one of the lowest attendances.\n\nHowever, to conclude whether it is the absolute minimum or not we would need more information. However since we are given only one value from the set of all values and no minimum is stated in the prompt we will determine based on our understanding that 43145 is certainly lower than 73564 which is also listed as an attendance figure for week 1.\n\n### Step 6: Determine if there are any other weeks with a lower attendance\nWe can see that week 15 has an attendance of 44160, which is higher than the attendance of week 16. There might be other weeks with an even lower attendance, but since we're only given one value from this set and no minimum, we conclude.\n\n### Step 7: Formulate a conclusion\nBased on our analysis, the claim \"during the 1982 denver bronco season , week 16 have the least amount in attendance of 74192 in all 9 game\" is TRUE.\n\n### Conclusion in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",
