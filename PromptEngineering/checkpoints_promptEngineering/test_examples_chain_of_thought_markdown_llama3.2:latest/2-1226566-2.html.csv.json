We need to determine if both Lotus and Honda produce 3 chassis at the same year (i.e., either 1989, 1990 or 1987 for each manufacturer).\n2. Look at the row in the table corresponding to the year 1987. The entrant is \"camel team lotus honda\", which contains both \"Lotus\" and \"Honda\". The chassis is \"lotus 99t\" produced by Honda.\n3. Since there is only one entry for each of these manufacturers in this row, we know that they are not producing the same number of chassis at this year.\n4. Move to the next relevant row corresponding to the year 1989. For this manufacturer, the chassis is \"lotus 101\" produced by Judd (not Honda).\n5. Now move to the row corresponding to the year 1990. There are two entries for Tyrrell Racing Organisation: one with chassis \"tyrrell 018\" and another with chassis \"tyrrell 019\". Neither of these chassis is produced by Honda, but both have the same engine type.\n6. Lastly, move to the row for 1991 and look at the entry for Braun Tyrrell Honda: this has a chassis number \"tyrrell 020\", which was again built on a Honda V10 power unit.\n7.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's examine the claim statement: \"while lotus and honda produce the same number of chassis the same model be never use 2 time\".\n   The claim states a condition that must be met for it to be true.\n\n2. Next, we need to find instances in the table where both Lotus and Honda have the same chassis.\n   Looking at the table, we see:\n   - In 1987, both Lotus (Lotus 99t) and Honda (Honda V6) had one different model but are not counted since they do not appear for this entry together on the list.\n   - In 1988, both Lotus (Lotus 100t) and Honda (Honda V6) have different models as well. This is also not counted because they do not appear in this combination on the list\n   - In 1989, Lotus has one model (Lotus 101), while Honda has another model (Judd V8). So this is also excluded.\n   - However, when looking at a specific year:\n     - In 1990, both Tyrrell Racing Organisation and Tyrrell Racing Organisation have the same chassis (Tyrrell 018 & Tyrrell 019).\n     - And in 1991, Braun-Tyrrell Honda has one model but not together with Honda on this list entry\n   The only combination that appears twice is for the same chassis model, which happens in:\n   ```markdown\n| row_index | column_name  |\n|-|-|\n|       0    |      year     |\n|       4    |      entrant   |\n|       5    |      chassis   |\n|       3    |      engine    |\n|       2    |      points   |\n```\n   For the model that appears twice it is used only once on this entry.\n\n3. Since we have found an instance where a model (Tyrrell 018) has been produced twice, but in only one row of the table because another model was present in that same year. Therefore we can conclude the statement to be TRUE.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim appears true since there are instances where a chassis has the same entrant (Tyrrell Racing Organisation) on the same year which is not used twice.\\n\\nHowever, this only applies to one entry and does not prove that all instances follow the rule. \\nTherefore, the final answer must be stated as TRUE\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the row that corresponds to 1987 year. According to the table, this row is:\n   ```markdown\n|   year | entrant                     | chassis     | engine      |   points |\n|-------:|:----------------------------|:------------|:------------|---------:|\n|   1987 | camel team lotus honda      | lotus 99t   | honda v6    |        7 |\n```\n\n2. Now, we need to check if the entrant \"camel team lotus honda\" earns the lowest amount of points in 1987. The points column for this row is 7. We also need to check other rows for the same entrant to ensure it's the lowest.\n\n3. Next, let's find the row that corresponds to the same entrant (\"camel team lotus honda\") and year (1987), but with different chassis or engine types:\n   ```\n|   year | entrant                     | chassis     | engine      |   points |\n|-------:|:----------------------------|:------------|:------------|---------:|\n|   1988 | camel team lotus honda      | lotus 100t  | honda v6    |        1 |\n```\n\n4. Now, we need to check if the entrant \"camel team lotus honda\" earns a lower amount of points in any other year. According to the table:\n   ```\n|   year | entrant                     | chassis     | engine      |   points |\n|-------:|:----------------------------|:------------|:------------|---------:|\n|   1989 | camel team lotus            | lotus 101   | judd v8     |        3 |\n```\n\n5. After examining all relevant rows, we can conclude that \"camel team lotus honda\" earns the lowest amount of points in 1987.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, let's identify the cells in the table where we can find information about the Honda V6 engine and the Cosworth V8 engine:\n   - For the Honda V6 engine: `year` = 1987, `points` is not specified for this engine.\n   - For the Cosworth V8 engine: `year` = 1990 (for both Tyrrell Racing Organisation cars), `points` is specified as 3 for both cars.\n\n2. Next, let's analyze the points scored by each engine type:\n   - The Honda V6 engine in 1987 scored 7 points.\n   - The Cosworth V8 engine in 1990 scored 3 points.\n\n3. Since we are comparing the points earned by the Honda V6 engine to those of the Cosworth V8 engine, and given that the problem claims the Honda V6 earns 3 less points than the Cosworth V8, let's verify this statement:\n   - The Honda V6 in 1987 scored more points (7) than the Cosworth V8 in 1990 (3).\n   - However, according to the claim, the Honda V6 engine should have scored 3 less points than the Cosworth V8 engine. This would imply the Honda V6 scoring 0 or a lower number of points.\n\n4. Now, considering our data from step 1:\n   - There is no information in the table that directly states the Cosworth V8 engine's points for comparison with any other engine type.\n   - We have no evidence to directly support or refute the claim based on the provided data alone.\n\nHowever, given the context of the problem and without additional data, we can only make an educated guess:\n- If there was a Honda V6 engine that scored lower than 3 points, it would indeed earn \"3 less\" points than the Cosworth V8 engine in 1990. \n- Since we don't have such a case to consider, but our initial comparison suggests no direct support for the claim based on available data, and given the problem asks us to determine if the statement is true or false without further context, we must conclude:\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
