First, let's identify the relevant columns for our claim:\n   - `crowd` represents the crowd size.\n   - We are interested in both the smallest and largest values.\n\n2.

First, we need to understand the claim: \"south melbourne lose by the largest amount of point of any other team\"\n   - This means we have to find the difference between home score and away score for South Melbourne.\n   - We also need to calculate this difference for every other team in the table.\n\n2. For each team, we'll calculate the difference between their scores:\n   - If the home score is less than the away score, then the difference will be away score minus home score (Away_score - Home_score).\n   - If the home score is greater than or equal to the away score, then the difference will be home score minus away score (Home_score - Away_score).\n\n3. For South Melbourne, we see they scored 10.15 and lost with a score of 11.7.\n   - The difference between these scores would be 11.7 - 10.15 = 1.55.\n\n4. Now we'll calculate the differences for every other team:\n   - Melbourne's home score is 19.8, away score is 12.17. Difference = 19.8 - 12.17 = 7.63.\n   - Essendon's difference would be 85 - 38 = 47.\n   - South Melbourne's difference we already calculated as 1.55.\n\n5. Next, we need to find out if there are any other teams with a greater difference between their home and away scores:\n   - Hawthorn lost by 14.16 - 9.13 = 5.03\n   - Geelong lost by 10.15 - 9.14 = 0.01\n   - Fitzroy lost by 7.6 - 7.16 = 0.44\n\n6. Now we'll check if any of these differences are greater than South Melbourne's difference:\n   - Only one other team has a greater difference: Essendon with 47 points.\n\n7. Since we found another team that has a larger difference, the claim is False for South Melbourne.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
