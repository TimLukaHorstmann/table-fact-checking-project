Now, we can compare the two dates:\n   - The difference between 5 may 1936 and 30 may 1935 is 1 year and approximately 2 months (60 days).

From the table, we can see that the launch date for ship 'havock' is 7 July 1936.\n3. Next, we can see that the launch date for ship 'hasty' is 5 May 1936.\n4. Now, we need to calculate the time difference between these two dates: 7 July 1936 (havock) and 5 May 1936 (hasty).\n5. To do this, we can subtract one date from the other:\n    - First, convert both dates to a comparable format. For simplicity, let's consider that '1st of January' is equivalent to day 0.\n    - Then, calculate the number of days between these two dates.\n\n#### Calculating Time Difference:\n\n- The launch date for ship 'havock' (7 July 1936) can be broken down into:\n  - Day of year: 208th\n  - Month: July\n  - Year: 1936\n\n- The launch date for ship 'hasty' (5 May 1936) can be broken down into:\n  - Day of year: 125th\n  - Month: May\n  - Year: 1936\n\n- Now, calculate the time difference between these two dates:\n    - The number of days from 1st January to 5th May is: 125\n    - The number of days from 1st May to 31st July is: (91) + (32) = 123\n    - Total days between 5 May 1936 and 7 July 1936: 125 + 123 = 248\n\n- Now, we need to add 2 days to this total:\n    - The new total number of days is: 248 + 2 = 250\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\n- After calculating the time difference between the launch dates for ship 'havock' and ship 'hasty', we see that the launch date for ship 'havock' is actually approximately 250 days (or roughly 7.08 months) after the launch of ship 'hasty'.\n\n- Since this matches our given claim, the answer is: TRUE\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"launched\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pennant number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"hasty\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"launches after havock by\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"launched\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"h24\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"h43\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"hasty\"}\n  ]\n}",
