Since we know she was a opponent of Andrea Petkovic before facing Simona Halep, if we find her opponent before her match against Simona Halep then it is true that Andrea Petkovic faced Justine Henin.\n\n3. **Find data about Justine Henin's opponents**: Look at all the rows where 'opponent in the final' is 'Justine Henin'. The row with \"19 june 2010\" has opponent as Justine Henin which was runner-up, and her next match's opponent is Petra kvitov\u00e1.\n \n4. **Find data about Simona Halep**: Look at all the rows where 'opponent in the final' is 'Simona Halep'.

Now, let's check if all matches involving Petra Kvitov\u00e1 were after 2010. If they were, then this would provide evidence that there are no matches of Andrea Petkovic on the surface before 2011.\n5. Looking at the table, we see that the first date for Petra Kvitov\u00e1 is January 8th, 2011.\n6. We can also confirm that all her grass court games happened after 2010.\n\n7.

This will help us identify which final was played on this specific date.\n\n| outcome     | date           | championship                                       | surface   | opponent in the final   | score in the final    |\n|:------------|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------|:------------------------|:----------------------|\n| winner      | 26 july 2009   | gastein ladies , bad gastein , austria             | clay      | ioana raluca olaru      | 6 - 2 , 6 - 3         |\n| runner - up | 19 june 2010   | unicef open , 's - hertogenbosch , netherlands     | grass     | justine henin           | 6 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 4 - 6 |\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the opponent in the final\nSince we found that July 26, 2009, corresponds to a \"winner\" row, we need to check the \"opponent in the final\" column to see if Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska was the opponent.\n\n#### Step 4: Compare the opponent with the claim\nWe will compare the identified opponent from the table with the name mentioned in the claim (Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska) to determine if they match.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion based on findings\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify the relevant table information to determine if Agnieszka Radwa\\u00f3ska was the opponent in the final on July 26, 2009.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Locate the row with the specified date to find which final was played on this specific date and verify if it matches with Agnieszka Radwa\\u00f0ska as the opponent.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Verify that the identified opponent from the table matches with Agnieszka Radwa\\u00f0ska to confirm the claim's validity.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
