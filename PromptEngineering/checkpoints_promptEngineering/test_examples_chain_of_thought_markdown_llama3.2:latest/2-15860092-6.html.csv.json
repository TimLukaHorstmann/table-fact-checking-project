For Rajasthan Royals, this means looking at their opponents' results in the specified columns, and for Kochi Tuskers Kerala, we'll only look at their own results.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate total games played\nFor both teams, we need to know how many games they actually played against their respective opponents to calculate win % accurately. For Rajasthan Royals, this includes matches played against Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Mumbai Indians, and Sunrisers Hyderabad in the specified time frames. For Kochi Tuskers Kerala, it's just the 2 matches played.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Rajasthan Royals' opponents\n- For Chennai Super Kings (2008 - 2013), they won all their games.\n- For Delhi Daredevils (2008 - 2013), there is no information on losses or ties for the duration specified, so we'll consider only wins and ties for our calculation.\n- For Kings XI Punjab (2008 - 2013), Rajasthan Royals lost all matches but won none of them in the context of calculating against their opponents directly.\n- For Mumbai Indians (2008 - 2013), the win % is not relevant to the claim.\n- For Sunrisers Hyderabad (2013), there is no information on losses or ties, so we'll consider only wins for this team.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Kochi Tuskers Kerala's opponents\nSince Kochi Tuskers Kerala was just one of their own matches and did not play any games against the opposing teams in question, they don't contribute to the calculation directly.\n\n### Step 6: Summarize wins and losses for calculations\n- Rajasthan Royals' win % calculation will involve only wins since there are no direct ties or losses mentioned in opposition results.\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala's win % is not relevant due to a lack of data against any opposing team.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate averages\nGiven the provided data, we can see that:\n- Rajasthan Royals won all their games against Delhi Daredevils (1 win).\n- For Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2013, there was 1 loss.\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala has no wins or losses to consider against any team.\n\n### Step 8: Determine the truth of the claim\nGiven the information and calculations above, it's clear that not all matches have the same win % due to different numbers of games played. Thus, we cannot accurately determine an average win % of exactly 50% for both teams based on the given data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        \"The claim requires calculating the average win percentage.\",\n        \"Rajasthan Royals had wins against Delhi Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad but also losses to Chennai Super Kings, Kings XI Punjab, Mumbai Indians, and losses/ties are mixed among other matches not relevant for this calculation.\",\n        \"Kochi Tuskers Kerala does not have any data that affects the claim directly since they only played against themselves.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"win %\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win %\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",
