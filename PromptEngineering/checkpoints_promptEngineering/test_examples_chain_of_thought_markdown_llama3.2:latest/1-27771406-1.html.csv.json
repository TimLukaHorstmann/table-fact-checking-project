    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of catches for Iver Mendonca.\n   To do this, we need to look at cells (15) and (16). In cell (16), there are 15 catches in 5 tests. We can calculate the average by multiplying the number of catches by the number of tests, then dividing by the total number of tests.\n\n2. Calculate Iver Mendonca's catch per test\n   The formula for this is (total catches)/(total tests). \n   For Iver Mendonca, the total catches are 8 and total tests are 2. So, his catch per test is 8/2 = 4\n\n3. Now we need to check if Iver Mendonca's average is indeed 4.\n   We can do this by calculating the average of all players in the table.\n\n4. Calculate the total catches for each player.\n   This involves looking at cells (no, catches) and multiplying them together.\n   Then divide the product by the number of tests for each player to find their catch per test.\n\n5. Compare Iver Mendonca's catch per test with his average\n   We need to compare 4 (Iver Mendonca's catch per test) with 8/2 = 4 (average).\n\n6. Determine if Iver Mendonca has the most catches per test.\n   If there is a player in the table who has an average higher than 4, then this claim is false. If no such player exists and Iver Mendonca's average is indeed 4, then this claim is true.\n\n\n\nNow we can output our answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"no\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"catches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"catches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"catches per test\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"no\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"no\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To verify this, we need to identify players whose test career started before 1960 and those who started in the 1960s.\n\nPlayers with a test career starting before 1960 are:\n- Ivan Barrow (1930 - 1939)\n- Cyril Christiani (1935)\n- Ralph Legall (1953)\n- Clifford McWatt (1954 - 1955)\n- Iver Mendonca (1962)\n\nThe claim that most of the test careers were in the 1960s seems to be incorrect because it doesn't account for players who started their career before 1960.\n\nNow, let's look at the number of players whose test career was entirely or started in the 1960s:\n\n- Jackie Hendriks (1962 - 1969) = 20\n- David Allan (1962 - 1966) = 5\n- Cliff McWatt (1954 - 1955) doesn't fully qualify because his start is before the stated range.\n- Mike Findlay (1969 - 1973) = 10\n\nCounting these players gives us a total of 35. However, we also need to consider Ivan Barrow's career which started in 1930 and lasted until 1939.\n\nSo, there are at least 36 test careers in the table. To accurately assess if most were in the 1960s, let's re-examine all players' start years:\n\n- Alfred Binns (1953 - 1956) starts before 1960.\n- Gerry Alexander (1957 - 1961) also doesn't meet the criteria since his career started after 1960.\n\nCorrecting our previous total for those whose test careers fully fall in the 1960s or start, we find that there are at least 33 players. Counting again, including Ivan Barrow and correcting for players starting before or exactly in the 1960s:\n\nThere are indeed more than half of the players having their test career in the 1960s.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on our corrected assessment, most of the test careers were indeed in the 1960s.\n\n### Final Answer JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players with a start year before 1960.\",\n    \"Find players whose test career started in the 1960s.\",\n    \"Count these players to see if most of the careers were in the 1960s.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has columns for 'player', 'club', 'test career', 'tests', 'catches', 'stumpings' and 'total dismissals'. Only the 'player' column directly answers the claim \"jamaica have a total of 5 players\".\n3. Next, we need to calculate the total number of players who played for Jamaica.\n4. We will count the number of rows with the word 'jamaica' in the 'club' or 'player' column.\n\nHere are the cell values that were relevant to our calculation:\n```markdown\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n]\n```\n5. We will count the number of times 'jamaica' appears in the list:\n   - In row 1, Jamaica played as Trinidad and Tobago\n   - In row 8, Jamaica played from 1953-1956\n   - In row 13, Jamaica played from 1957-1961\n   - In row 14, Jamaica played from 1962-1969\n   - In row 15, Jamaica played in 1962\n   - In row 16, Jamaica played from 1962-1966\n   - In row 18, Jamaica played from 1969-1973\n   So the total number of times 'jamaica' appears is 7\n\nNow we have to go back and count how many players are there in total.\n```markdown\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"}\n]\n```\n6.

However, there is another row where player cyril christiani also had 1 stump in 7 dismissals indicating 1 stumping so a player with 0 stumpings cannot be identified from this table.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nSince we are unable to identify any player that has never made at least one dismissal count of \"stump\" the chain of thought was incomplete because I couldn't conclude the claim based on the table.

First, let's check if Clifford McWatt played for club Jamaica.\n   According to the table, we need to look at the 'club' column and see if 'Jamaica' is listed as the value in any row.\n\n2. Next, since the claim says 'most succesful player', we'll need to calculate or find out which player from Jamaica had the most dismissals (total dismissals) in their test career.\n   The total dismissal for Clifford McWatt is given in his relevant cell: 9.\n\n3. Now, let's check if there are any other players from Jamaica who scored more dismissals than Clifford McWatt.\n   By looking at the table again, we can see that Jackie Hendriks had a higher number of tests (20) and dismissals (47), but for our case, we need to focus on players with higher total dismissals.\n   We'll look through the relevant cells of other Jamaican players.\n\n4. Next, we compare Clifford McWatt's total dismissal to that of Gerry Alexander who played for Jamaica.\n   The total dismissal for Gerry Alexander is given in his relevant cell: 90.\n\n5. Since Gerry Alexander had more total dismissals (90) than Clifford McWatt (9), we can conclude that the claim \"club jamaica 's most succesful player be clifford mcwatt\" is false because Gerry Alexander was Jamaica's most successful player, not Clifford McWatt.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"total dismissals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"total dismissions\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
