To verify this, we need to count the number of roller coasters at each themed area.\n\nLooking at the table, we see:\n- Action Park has 2 roller coasters (the shock wave and g force).\n- Aerial Park has 2 roller coasters (buffalo mountain coaster and ben 10 - ultimate mission).\n- Thomas Land has 1 roller coaster (troublesome trucks runaway coaster).\n\n3.

Comparing this to the previous count, we can see that all the mentioned rides in the claim have a themed area but, unfortunately, there is only one roller coaster at the \"Thomas Land\" area.\n\n5.

These are in cells (5) and (7), respectively.\n3. **Extract the \"opened\" values**: For both rows, we need to see when they were opened. For \"the G Force\", this is 2005. For \"Trouble Trucks Runaway Coaster\", it's 2008.\n4. **Compare the \"opened\" dates**:\n   - The G Force was opened in 2005.\n   - Trouble Trucks Runaway Coaster was opened in 2008.\n5. **Determine if they were constructed at the same time**: No, they weren't, as their opening dates are not the same.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opened\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"opened\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opened\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opened\"}\n  ]\n}",
