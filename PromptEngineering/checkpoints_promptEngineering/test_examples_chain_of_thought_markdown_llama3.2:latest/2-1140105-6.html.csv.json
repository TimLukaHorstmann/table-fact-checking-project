    "resp": "### Step 1: Locate the constructor \"Porsche\" in the table\nThe first step is to identify which team, if any, uses Porsche as their constructor in the 1961 Formula One season.\n\n### Step 2: Review the \"constructor\" column for a mention of \"Porsche\"\nLooking at each row, there is only one instance where we can find a driver or team associated with Porsche. The relevant row in the table would be `i coppa italia`, which contains `porsche` as its constructor.\n\n### Step 3: Determine how many drivers are on the list using Porsche\nNow that we know Porsche was used by at least one team, we need to see if Giancarlo Baghetti is associated with this team. \n\nBaghetti is a Ferrari driver and not associated with Porsche.\n\nHowever, we can verify the claim's truth value for another driver who uses Porsche: Giancarlo Baghetti isn't the only one; there aren't three drivers using Porsche in 1961.\n\n### Step 4: Check if Giancarlo Baghetti is indeed a driver associated with \"Porsche\"\nGiven our findings, we must confirm that Baghetti isn't a part of this claim.
