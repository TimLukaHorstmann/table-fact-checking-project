The highest scorer was Danny Granger.\n- **Game 3**: Grangers' high was 22 points, which is not the highest in that game. The highest scorer was Mike Dunleavy.\n- **Game 4**: Grangers' high was 17 points, which is not the highest in that game. The highest scorer was Danny Granger.\n- **Game 5**: Grangers' high was 22 points, which is not the highest in that game. The highest scorers were tied at 22 points.\n- **Game 6**: Grangers' high was 23 points, which is not the highest in that game. The highest scorer was Mike Dunleavy.\n- **Game 7**: Grangers' high was 27 points, which is not the highest in that game. The highest scorer was Jermaine O'Neal.\n- **Game 8**: Grangers' high was 29 points, which is the highest in that game.\n- **Game 9**: Grangers' high was 33 points, which is the highest in that game.\n- **Game 10**: Grangers' high was 25 points, which is not the highest in that game. The highest scorer was Mike Dunleavy.\n- **Game 11**: Grangers' high was 25 points, which is not the highest in that game. The highest scorer was Mike Dunleavy.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter reviewing all relevant games and counting those where Danny Granger scored more points than any other player (the leading scorer), we find that there are indeed at least **5** such games out of the 11 home games listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify claim about Danny Granger being the leading scorer in most of his home games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate relevant data in the table for the score column to identify leading scorers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count how many home games had Danny Granger as the leading scorer out of 11 total listed in the home column\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output shows that the claim is correct based on the given data from the table.",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Extract the total scores from January 12th and January 26th:\n   - For January 12th, the total score can be found in cell `row_index=7` and `column_name='score'`, which contains the value `105`.\n   - For January 26th, the total score can be found in cell `row_index=25` and `column_name='score'`, which contains the value `98`.\n\n2. Calculate the total scores for both dates:\n   - The total score for January 12th is `105`.\n   - The total score for January 26th is `98`.\n\n3. Compare the total scores:\n   - Since `98` is less than `105`, the game played on January 26th has a lower total score than the game played on January 12th.\n\n4.
