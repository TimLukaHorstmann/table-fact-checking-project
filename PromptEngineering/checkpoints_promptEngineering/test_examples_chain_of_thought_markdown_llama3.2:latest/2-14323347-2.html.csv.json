To verify this claim, we need to check the \"supercopa 1994\" column of the table for each team.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that in the row for Argentinos Juniors, the value in the \"supercopa 1994\" column is \"1st round\", not \"n / a\" or \"did not qualify\".\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that the claim is false, since it's possible that both teams did qualify but then lost in the first round.\n5. To further verify the claim, we can check the \"supercopa 1994\" column for Racing Club.
