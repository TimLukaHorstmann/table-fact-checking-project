This implies that the White Sox have played against an opponent more than once.\n\n### Step 2: Review Table Structure\nThe table shows games played with details such as date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. We need to find instances where the White Sox play against the same opponent more than once.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Relevant Games for White Sox\nTo verify the claim, we will focus on games where the White Sox are the opponent. The relevant cells for this step include:\n```markdown\n{\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n}\n```\n### Step 4: Analyze Opponents for White Sox\nLooking at the table, we can see that the White Sox played against:\n- Yankees (september 1)\n- White Sox themselves (september 2, 3, 4)\n- Red Sox (september 5, 6, 7, 8)\n- Indians (september 9, 10, 11)\n- Devil Rays (september 13, 14, 15, 20)\n- Orioles (september 16, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26)\n\n### Step 5: Determine Truth of Claim\nThe White Sox have played against more than one opponent in the given table. Specifically, they have played against:\n- Yankees (1 time)\n- Red Sox (4 times)\n- Indians (3 times)\n- Devil Rays (4 times)\n- Orioles (7 times)\n\nThis means the claim that \"white sox be not opponent only 1 time\" is false.\n\n### Step 6: Define Final Answer\nGiven our analysis, we can now define the final answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\"The claim states that the White Sox played against an opponent only once.\", \n                         \"However, upon reviewing the table, it's clear they played multiple times against various opponents.\"],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output is in the required format.",
