    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. Identify the claim to be evaluated: The claim states that the highest attendance was at the American Airlines Center.\n2. Locate the relevant cell in the table that contains the attendance data: The attendance data for each game is listed in the \"attendance\" column (column index 5).\n3. Compare the attendance values with each other:\n   - At game 75, the attendance was 18422.\n   - At game 76, the attendance was also 18422.\n   - At game 77, the attendance was 20301.\n   - Other games have lower or equal attendance than this value.\n4. Determine if any of these values are higher than 20301:\n   - Only the value for game 75 is not higher, but a tie exists between other games as well.\n   - There's an entry with 20301 (game 77) and another entry (game 80) that shows a value close to it in attendance. The value of game 80 is 18478.\n5. Since the highest attendance was actually at more than one location and not just the American Airlines Center, determine if any other games have an even higher value:\n   - Games 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, and 82 all have lower attendance values when compared to game 80.\n\n6. Conclusion: The claim that \"the highest attendance be at the american airline center\" is not entirely accurate since there are multiple locations (us airways center and new orleans arena) where games had higher attendance values.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate the relevant cell in the table that contains the attendance data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Compare the attendance values with each other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if any of these values are higher than 20301\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Since the highest attendance was actually at more than one location and not just the American Airlines Center, determine if any other games have an even higher value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 77,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 80,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if there's another game with higher attendance against New Orleans:\n   - Looking at the table again, we see that row 80 has an attendance value of 18478.\n   - The claim suggests that game 78 should not have had the highest attendance since 17781 is lower than 18478.\n\n4.
