    "resp": "### Claim Analysis: Croatia Play Malta on March 30 in a World Cup Qualifier\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify relevant cells**: The claim states that Croatia play Malta on March 30 in a world cup qualifier, which means we need to find the row where `team_A` is \"Croatia\", `date` is \"March 30\", and `country_B` is \"Malta\".\n\n2. **Find matching rows**: We can refer to the table and see that there are multiple matches with different teams. Specifically, looking at rows 151 and 155, both have `team_A` as \"Croatia\" and `country_B` as \"Malta\". However, we need a match on March 30.\n\n3. **Check dates**: For row 151, the date is March 30, which matches our claim. We can ignore rows 155 because its date is September 7, not March 30.\n\n4. **Verify team names**: Both in row 151 and in row 154, we find \"Croatia\" as `team_A`. Also both have `country_B` Malta and that `row_index` is between the 153rd and 155th entry (thus after 149).\n\n5. **Final Conclusion**:\nSince we found a match on March 30 with Croatia as team A, and Malta as country B, our claim is TRUE.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 151,\n      \"column_name\": \"Date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 153,\n      \"column_name\": \"Row Index\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 149, \"column_name\": \"149\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 151, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 152, \"column_name\": \"153\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 154, \"column_name\": \"154\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 155, \"column_name\": \"155\"}\n  ]\n}",

After rechecking we see that 17 august is a friendly match (but does not count because is not sept) , and indeed there are two other dates mentioned, \"3 september\" and \"8 october\", one of them belong to the claim because has \"friendly\".\n5. Looking at these two matching entries in the table, they have all necessary information to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n6.
