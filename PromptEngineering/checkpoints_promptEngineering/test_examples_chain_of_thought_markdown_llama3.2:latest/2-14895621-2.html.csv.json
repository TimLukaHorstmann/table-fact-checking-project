    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng 3 times at tournaments.\n\n2. Look for relevant information in the table:\n   - In the \"partner\" column, we can see the partner of each athlete.\n   - Since the claim specifically mentions Kang Haeng, we need to find rows where Kang Haeng is listed as the partner.\n\n3. Find rows with Kang Haeng as the partner:\n   - From the table, we can see that there are at least three instances where Kang Haeng is listed as the partner: \n     * At the Asian Games in 1982 (row 1), Kang Haeng is listed as the partner.\n     * At the India Open in 1985 (row 6), Kang Haeng is listed as the partner.\n\n4. Check if Hwang Sun was the athlete competing with Kang Haeng:\n   - In row 3, under the \"partner\" column, we see that it's indeed Kang Haeng, and under the \"event\" column, it says \"wd\" (which likely stands for 'women's doubles'), so this suggests that Hwang Sun competed in a women's doubles event.\n   - However, looking at row 6 again, under the \"partner\" column, we see Kang Haeng. Under the \"event\" column, however, it is stated as other open tournaments. Therefore, since it states \"wd\", then this means it must be Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng competing in a women's doubles event.\n\n5. Check if there are three instances where Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng teamed up:\n   - From the steps above, we've found two instances of Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng partnering up together: Asian Games 1982 (row 1) and India Open 1985 (row 6).\n   - We also see in row 3 that Kang Haeng is indeed her partner. However since row 3 mentions the 'wd' column, it does state this to be women's doubles.\n\n6. Determine if the claim is true or false:\n   - Since we found at least three instances of Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng partnering up (assuming the Asian Games 1982 and India Open both count towards the claim), the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\":1,\n            \"description\":\"Claim is that hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 times at tournament\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\":2,\n            \"description\":\"Find rows where Kang Haeng listed as the partner in table\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\":3,\n            \"description\":\"Check if Hwang Sun was athlete competing with Kang Haeng\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\":4,\n            \"description\":\"Check if there are three instances of Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng teamed up \"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\":5,\n            \"description\":\"Based on the information gathered, determine if claim is true or false\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\":1,\n            \"column_name\":\"partner\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\":3,\n            \"column_name\":\"partner\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\":6,\n            \"column_name\":\"partner\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",

    "resp": "Step 1: Analyze the table to identify the relevant information for the claim.\n\nTo determine if the claim about Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open finishing first two years after winning the Asian Games is true, we need to look for the following:\n- The year of winning the Asian Games\n- The partner's name mentioned in the table for that event and year\n- The outcome of the tournament in which Hwang Sun participated with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant information from the table.\n\nFrom the table, we find:\n- In 1982 (the year before the claim's timeframe), Hwang Sun won Asian Games and was partnered with Kang Haeng. The outcome of this event is \"asian games\" and not a number. However, in 1985 (two years after winning the Asian Game), Hwang Sun participated in another tournament at India Open with Kang Haeng, finishing first.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the claim can be true based on the information found.\n\nGiven that Hwang Sun won the Asian Games in 1982 and finished first two years later with Kang Haeng at the India Open (in 1985), we need to check if there's an event of \"world championships\" or any other type of tournament mentioned in the table for which the conditions are true. However, the claim does not specify a particular outcome other than Asian Games and the India Open events directly. Thus, our main focus remains on Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng's partnership at the 1985 India Open.\n\nStep 4: Identify if there is any conflicting information that could make the claim false.\n\nThere isn't any information in the table that contradicts the claim about winning the Asian Games before partnering with Kang Haeng. However, to confirm the truth of the claim, we need additional specific details about how Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng performed together at the 1985 India Open.\n\nStep 5: Draw a final conclusion based on the information available in the table.\n\nGiven that we do have information confirming Hwang Sun's partnership with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open, we can conclude that if this event indeed happened and resulted in finishing first, then the claim about partnering with Kang Haeng two years after winning the Asian Games would be true. However, since our main source is the performance of the team at the India Open (and not a separate world championship or other tournament directly tied to Hwang Sun's win), we must consider if such an event occurred.\n\nStep 6: Conclude that without explicit details on how this partnership relates to finishing first in another specific event after winning Asian Games, there is still some uncertainty. However, given the straightforward nature of the claim and the direct evidence provided, it leans towards being true because Hwang Sun did finish first at the India Open two years after winning the Asian Games.\n\nSince we are tasked with determining if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information directly found in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The analysis focused on identifying relevant events and outcomes. The specific partnership at the India Open for Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng, happening two years after winning Asian Games, suggests a true scenario given direct evidence of their performance.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output indicates that based on the analysis, the claim is true.",

The table has a column for \"partner\" which might indicate this information.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Relevant Rows\nLooking at the table, we can identify rows where \"event\" is \"Asian Games\". These are the relevant rows because they mention Asian Games events.\n\n| row_index | outcome                | event                  | year                   | venue                  | partner                |\n|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2         | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            |\n| 6         | other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments | other open tournaments |\n| 4         | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            | asian games            |\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Asian Games Events\nWe count how many times \"Asian Games\" appears as an event. From step 3, we see that it appears three times.\n\n### Step 5: Verify Each Partnership is with Asian Games\nTo verify if Hwang Sun partnered with these Asian Games events, we need to check the values in the \"partner\" column for each relevant row from step 3.

However, in row 6, the partner is \"Kang Haeng-Suk\", not \"Hwang Sun\".\n\n### Step 7: Determine the Truth of the Claim\nGiven our findings from step 6, we see that only two out of three instances where Asian Games were involved have Hwang Sun as the partner. Therefore, the claim that Hwang Sun partnered with Asian Games five times at tournaments is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Understand the Claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Find Relevant Data in the Table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Identify Relevant Rows\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Count the Number of Asian Games Events\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Verify Each Partnership is with Asian Games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Check if Each Partnership is with Asian Games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Determine the Truth of the Claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

According to the table, in 1985, Hwang Sun participated in the \"Asian Games\" as a \"wd\" (which might imply that she didn't win).\n3. **Analyze Kang Haeng**: The cell at row index 3 and column name \"partner\" contains \"kang haeng - suk\", which matches with the claim.\n4. **Find Hwang Sun's wins**: \n\t* In the table, we have two rows where Hwang Sun won an event: one in 1982 (outcome is \"other open tournaments\") and another in 1985 (venue is \"India Open\").\n\t* The claim states that Hwang Sun won two out of three events with Kang Haeng.\n5. **Check if the claim is true**: Since Hwang Sun didn't participate in the Asian Games in 1985 as a competitor, but participated as a \"wd\", and only won one event (in 1982) out of the two mentioned, the claim seems to be inconsistent.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that hwang sun partnered with kang haeng at the 1982 new delhi, india event and finished first two years after winning the world championship.\n   - First, we need to find the year of the first world championship for hwang sun and kang haeng in order to determine if there are two consecutive years when they finished first. \n   - Looking at the table, we see that the row with \"world championships\" in the outcome column has the same values for every other column. Specifically, it says \"wd\" for event, \"1985\" for year, \"calgary , canada\" for venue and partner for both events. The only variable is the name of the organization, which changes between world championships, Asian Games, open tournaments, etc.\n\n2. Now we must find out if there was a world championship for hwang sun and kang haeng before 1985 so that they could finish first two years after it.\n   - From \"world championships\" row we see hwang sun's name on the year 1985. However this is not possible because it would mean that they won both the 1982 New Delhi, India and the 1985 Calgary , Canada events in consecutive years which is impossible.\n\n3. Now we must figure out if there was a world championship for hwang sun before 1985 so that they could finish first two years after it.\n   - Since there were no other events on the \"world championships\" row before 1982, this would mean there is at least one year of a world championship with hwang sun and kang haeng (which would be in 1982).\n   - The only way that their partnership could work two years after winning a World Championship would be for the next year to have been won by them as well. \n\n4. To determine if this is true, we need to figure out if there was another world championship with hwang sun and kang haeng in 1983.\n   - Looking at the table again, we see that \"wd\" is written in the event column for the year 1982 (as seen previously) but it must be noted there is an Asian Games row. The row for the 1982 Asian games is: 'asian games' , 'asian games' , '1982' and 'new delhi , india'. \n\n5. Now we can figure out if hwang sun and kang haeng won a world championship in 1983 (two years after the 1981 event). \n   - We see that the year 1982 is only filled by one row of Asian Games with their names, which leaves us with no indication for hwang sun and kang haeng winning another world championship.\n   - Since there were no other rows on \"world championships\" than those with hwang sun and kang haeng's name in the \"event\" column and since 1982 was taken by Asian games, we can assume that this is indeed the case.\n\n6. To check if their partnership works two years after winning a world championship would mean there must be a world championship two years after the one where they finished first with a value of '1' in the \"outcome\" column.\n   - There is only one other world championships row with hwang sun and kang haeng's name, which was 1985, so we must calculate if they could have won that year as well (which would be two years after their first event).\n   - To determine this, we see that the outcome \"world championships\" for both world championships rows has a value of '3'. Therefore it can be concluded that hwang sun and kang haeng were not partners in both those events.\n\n7. After going over all steps, the claim is false because there was no world championship with hwang sun and kang haeng's name after their first one which means they could not have won another world championship two years after it.\n\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant information: The claim mentions Hwang Sun finishing first at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985 with her partner Kang Haeng.\n   - Relevant table cells:\n     ```\n     | row_index | column_name      |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         0 | outcome         |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         1 | event            |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         2 | year             |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         3 | venue             |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         4 | partner           |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     ```\n   - The outcome is \"world championships\" or \"asian games\" or \"other open tournaments\". We need to find the event that matches the claim.\n\n2. Look for a match between \"wd\" and \"3 different venues from 1982 to 1985\": \n   - We can see in the table that \"wd\" (the second cell of the first row) is associated with outcome \"world championships\". However, this does not directly confirm or deny the claim.\n   - The claim mentions \"different venues\", so we need to look for a row where there are 3 different venues between years.\n\n3.

Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE: \n   - The claim states that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng finished first at three different venues between 1982 and 1985.\n   - From the table, we can see two instances of a match for this condition:\n     ```\n     | row_index | column_name      |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         1 | wd              |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         2 | 1985             |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         3 | india open      |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         4 | kang haeng - suk |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     ```\n    ```\n     | row_index | column_name      |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         1 | wd              |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         2 | 1985             |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         3 | calgary , canada |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n     |         4 | kang haeng - suk |\n     +-----------+------------------+\n    ```\n   - However, there are only two venues mentioned that meet the criteria (India Open and Calgary Canada), not three. So, we can determine the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The chain of thought involved analyzing each row in the table to find matches for the claim about Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng finishing first at 3 different venues between 1982 and 1985.
