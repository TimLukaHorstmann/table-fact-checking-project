For c3, it is given as 10 in the year 1906.\n\nStep 4: Compare the numbers of built i1 and c3 locomotives\nWe need to compare the number of built i1 locomotives (20) with the number of built c3 locomotives (10).\n\nStep 5: Determine if there are indeed 10 fewer i1 builds than c3\nSince 20 is greater than 10, there are not exactly 10 fewer i1 builds than c3. However, we need to check if it's true that \"there be 10 fewer i1 builds\" instead of \"exactly 10 fewer\".\n\nStep 6: Analyze the claim for any possible ambiguities or assumptions\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that \"there be 10 fewer i1 builds\" is a somewhat informal and vague way to express the idea. In standard mathematical language, this would mean \"the difference between the number of i1 locomotives built and the number of c3 locomotives built is exactly 10\".\n\nStep 7: Conclude based on the analysis\nGiven that we determined in Step 4 that there are not exactly 10 fewer i1 builds than c3, but also acknowledging that the claim as stated might be considered true due to its ambiguous nature (it could imply a range of values rather than an exact difference), our conclusion is nuanced.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the classes mentioned in the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the number of built i1 locomotives\",\n      \"data\": {\n        \"class\": \"i1\",\n        \"value\": 20\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the number of built c3 locomotives\",\n      \"data\": {\n        \"class\": \"c3\",\n        \"value\": 10\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the numbers of built i1 and c3 locomotives\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if there are indeed 10 fewer i1 builds than c3\",\n      \"data\": {\n        \"class\": \"difference\",\n        \"value\": 10\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze the claim for any possible ambiguities or assumptions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclude based on the analysis\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}",
