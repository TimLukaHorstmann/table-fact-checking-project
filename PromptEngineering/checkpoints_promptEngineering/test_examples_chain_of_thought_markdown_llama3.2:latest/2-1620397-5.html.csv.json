We can do this by examining each row in the table that has \"Guardian of Prophecy\" as the title and its corresponding columns for \"featuring\".\n3. For the first step, we will focus on the following relevant cells:\n   ```\n   | row_index | column_name    |\n   |:---------|:---------------|\n   | 5        | featuring      |\n   ```\n   Since this is a multi-value cell, there are more than one characters appearing in this episode.\n4. We can now determine that since there's at least two character(s) featured in \"the guardian of prophecy\" (peri and possibly others), the claim that 'The Guardian of Prophecy' be the only episode to featuring just 1 character is false.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"featuring\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"featuring\"}\n  ]\n}",

Thus, at least one episode features this character.\n   - Character 3 (Dalek): Only one episode, \"6eb / a\" (The Elite), features the Dalek.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the release date average is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of months covered by the table**: The table spans from October 2011 to September 2012, which covers a period of approximately 14 months.\n\n2. **Count the number of releases in the table**: There are 7 releases mentioned in the table (one for each row).\n\n3. **Calculate the average release date interval**: To calculate the average interval between releases, we need to count the intervals:\n   - The first release is in October 2011.\n   - The second release is in November 2011, which is 1 month after the first one.\n   - The third release is in December 2011, which is 1 month after the second one.\n   - The fourth release is in May 2012, which is 5 months after the third one.\n   - The fifth release is in June 2012, which is 1 month after the fourth one.\n   - The sixth release is in July 2012, which is 1 month after the fifth one.\n\n   So, there are 3 intervals of 1 month each and 3 intervals of 5 months each (from May to July).\n\n4. **Calculate the total interval**: The total interval for all releases would be:\n   - 3 x 1 = 3\n   - 3 x 5 = 15\n\nThe total interval is 18.\n\n5. **Determine if the average release date interval matches the claim**: There are 7 intervals in total, so to find the average we divide by 7 instead of 10:\n\n    The average would be (3 + 15) / 7 which equals approximately 9/7.\n\n6. **Compare with the claim**: Since 1 month averages every other month is not true for this release pattern it can't be said that the claim \"the release date average 1 every 2 months\" matches the data provided in this table.\n\n\n\nHere's how I would format my answer as a JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the total number of months covered by the table\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"6y / ai\", \"release_date\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the number of releases in the table\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"any row\", \"doctor\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate the average release date interval\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"2nd\", \"release_date\", \"1st\", \"release_date\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"released\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"released\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"released\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
