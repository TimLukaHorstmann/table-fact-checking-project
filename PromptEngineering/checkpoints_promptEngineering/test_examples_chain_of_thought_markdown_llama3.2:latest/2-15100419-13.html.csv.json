To do this, we will compare his overall pick value (252) with Chad Nkang's overall pick value (251).\n3. If we find that Andrew Carnahan does have a higher overall pick value than Chad Nkang, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning in detail:\n\n- Start by finding Andrew Carnahan's row_index and column_name from the table: Andrew Carnahan is located at row_index 7 and his column_name is \"overall\".\n- Then, find Chad Nkang's row_index and column_name from the table: Chad Nkang is located at row_index 7 and his column_name is also \"overall\".\n- Now we have both relevant cells needed to compare these two values.\n- By comparing Andrew Carnahan's overall value (252) with Chad Nkang's overall value (251), we can determine that Andrew Carnahan indeed has the highest overall pick value.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},{ \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"} ]\n}",

To verify the claim, we need to check if Chad Nkang was indeed picked 41st from Elon and Andrew Carnahan was indeed picked 42nd from Arizona State.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that in the 7th round, there are three players:\n   - John Broussard\n   - Chad Nkang\n   - Andrew Carnahan\n\n3. We need to find out which team each of these players was picked from. From the table, we know that:\n   - John Broussard was picked 41st and his team is San Jose State.\n   - Chad Nkang was picked 41st but his team is Elon.\n\n4. Now let's look at Andrew Carnahan's row in the table again (row 7). We see that pick #42 corresponds to him, and his college is Arizona State.\n\n5. Based on our findings so far:\n    - Chad Nkang was not picked from Elon because he was picked 41st from San Jose State.\n    - Andrew Carnahan was picked from Arizona State as required by the claim.\n\n6. Therefore we must verify whether John Broussard, who got picked 41th, is actually from San Jose State (the table confirms it). \n\n7. Based on our analysis so far:\n   - We've verified that Chad Nkang wasn't indeed from Elon.\n   - Andrew Carnahan was indeed from Arizona State.\n   - However, we found John Broussard to be the player who got picked 41st.\n\n8.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the colleges where Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson were drafted from.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Mike Sims-Walker was drafted from Central Florida (row 3, column \"college\") and Reggie Nelson was drafted from Florida (row 1, column \"college\").\n\n2. Next, we need to check if both Chad Nkang and Andrew Carnahan were also drafted from the same college as Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Chad Nkang was drafted from Elon (row 7, column \"college\") and Andrew Carnahan was drafted from Arizona State (row 7, column \"college\"). \n\n3. Since Mike Sims-Walker was drafted from Central Florida and Reggie Nelson was drafted from Florida, but Chad Nkang and Andrew Carnahan were drafted from different colleges (Elon and Arizona State respectively) we can say the claim is False\n\n4. The chain of thought for this answer was:\n\"Claim about Mike Sims - Walker and Reggie Nelson be both draft from college where chad nkang and andrew carnahan be from\nSince they are not from same College, then Claim is False\"\n\n5. Finally, here's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First we identified colleges of Mike Sims-Walker and Reggie Nelson which were Central Florida and Florida respectively.\n Then we found Chad Nkang and Andrew Carnahan draft from different colleges.\n Since they are not from same College, then Claim is False\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}",
