Next, let's examine each row in the table for the founded year of each club:\n   - Academia Quintana FC (1969)\n   - Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC (2008)\n   - Bayam\u00f3n FC (2009)\n   - Fajardo FC (2010)\n   - Guaynabo Fluminense FC (2002)\n   - Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC (1998)\n   - Puerto Rico Islanders FC (2003)\n   - CF Tornados de Humacao (1994)\n\n3. We then determine how many teams were founded before 1970:\n   - Academia Quintana FC (1969) was founded before 1970\n   - Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC (1998) was also founded before 1970\n\n4. Since two teams were found to have been founded before 1970, we must check if the claim allows for more than one team.\n\n5. According to the claim, \"only 1 team be found before 1970\", it is clear that this does not account for multiple teams since there are indeed more than one (two) in our findings above\n\n6.

If CF Tornados de Humacao's `seasons_in_prsl` is greater than 0 (meaning it has played in PRSL), then it is indeed a recent addition to the league. However, if it only has one season in PRSL (i.e., `seasons_in_prsl = 1`), we need to verify that no other team with more seasons in PRSL exists.\n\n5. To find out if any other teams joined after CF Tornados de Humacao's debut, we can compare the row index of CF Tornados de Humacao with other teams' rows. If there are no other teams with a higher or equal row index that have played in PRSL more seasons, then it is confirmed that CF Tornados de Humacao is indeed the most recent team to join.\n\n6.
