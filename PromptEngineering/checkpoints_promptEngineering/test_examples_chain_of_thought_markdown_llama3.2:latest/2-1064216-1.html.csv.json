We can start by examining the data in the \"lecturers\" column of the table.\n3. Looking at the numbers in this column, we see that they vary across different rows, representing different schools.\n4. For example, in Row 1, the number of lecturers is 5, which falls within the desired range of 4 to 18.\n5. Similarly, in Row 2, the number of lecturers is 9, also within the specified range.\n6. However, we need to verify this for all rows and schools.\n\n### Chain of Thought:\n\n- Check if each row's \"lecturers\" value falls between 4 and 18.\n- Verify that this applies to every school in the table.\n- List relevant cells with their corresponding row index and column name.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"column_name\": \"lecturers\"\n  }\n]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter examining the data in the \"lecturers\" column, it appears that not all numbers fall within the specified range.

Identify the minimum and maximum total numbers of academic staff mentioned in the table.\n   - The minimum number is found in row 7 where \"lecturers\" is 4, \"associate professors\" is 10, \"assistant professors\" is 9, \"professors\" is 14, and \"total\" is 51. However, for our calculation we will use the \"lecturers\" column which has a value of 4.\n   - The maximum number is found in row 6 where \"lecturers\" is 7, \"associate professors\" is 13, \"assistant professors\" is 10, \"professors\" is 48, and \"total\" is 78. However, for our calculation we will use the \"lecturers\" column which has a value of 7.\n\n2. Compare these two numbers with the range mentioned in the claim.\n   - The range mentioned is from 24 to 120.\n   - Since both numbers (4 and 78) are below this range, we need to identify if there's any other row that exceeds this range for \"lecturers\". Looking at our table we can see that the minimum number mentioned in row 7 of \"lecturers\" column is 4 which doesn't exceed the lower limit. But the maximum value is 78 and also it does not exceed the upper limit (120).\n   - However, let's check all rows to make sure that no other row exceeds this range for \"lecturers\". \n   - Upon inspection of each row in the table, we see that row 6 has a total number of lecturers equal to 7. Since 78 is below 120, and 4 (minimum) is also below 24, all values of lecturers are within the specified range.\n\n3.

Since 6 * 1.97 is not equal to a whole number, there are more than 6 times as many associate professors as lecturers.\n\nHowever, the claim states \"more\", so we need to check for any cases where the claim might be true, like if one of the rows had a lecturer count that would make the ratio exactly 6.
