    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the requirement for a team to have less than 10 finishes\nTo determine if only 3 teams have less than 10 finishes, we need to identify which teams had fewer than 10 finishes in an individual year.\n\n### Step 2: Look for years where the finish count is less than 10\nFrom the table, we can see that there are multiple years with finish counts of less than 10. For example, Simon had less than 10 finishes in 1985 (8), 1993 (3), and 1994 (2).\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of teams with fewer than 10 finishes\nThere are at least 3 teams mentioned as having fewer than 10 finishes: \n- Shierson had a finish count of less than 10 in 1988 (7) and 1989 (3).\n- Simon had multiple years where the team's finish was under 10, most notably 1985 (18), 1992 (7), 1993 (4), and 1994 (21).\n\nHowever, we can easily identify more teams. For example:\n- Truesports finished in position 28.\n- McCormack had a finish of 19.\n- Treadway's G-Force cars raced by F Giaffone had finishes ranging from 16 to 24.\n\nSo there are at least three more (treadway has the same number but it is shared, as the information only says it \"raced\" the car in that year). \n\nHowever, I am also including the teams that had less than 10. Brant ended the season with a finish of 12 and Menard ended with a finish of 21.\n\n### Step 4: Verify if there are any other years or teams that meet this criterion\nWe can observe that Shierson's team only finished with fewer than 10 in two years, while Treadway also had only one race where they didn't have the 8th position. Since Truesports and Brant both ended with a finish of less than ten, it is evident that there are more teams meeting this requirement.\n\n### Step 5: Summarize findings\nSince we can find at least four other teams (Truesports, Treadway, McCormack, and Brant) besides the three mentioned previously, where fewer than 10 finishes are observed in an individual year.

The row with the highest finish is:\n- For 2002, finish is 21.\n\nThe row for 2002 has the most finishes so far at 21. Now comparing 1993 to 2002 we have that 1993 only has a 4th-place and 2002 has the highest place as above with 21. The second-highest (as stated in the claim) must then be for 1993, but indeed it's lower than 21.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if 'team Simon' have a total of 59 finishes as claimed.\nSince we found that team Simon has a total of 63 finishes and not 59, the statement is FALSE.",
