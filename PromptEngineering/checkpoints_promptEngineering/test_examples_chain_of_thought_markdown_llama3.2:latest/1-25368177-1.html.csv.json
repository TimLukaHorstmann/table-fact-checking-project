However, there isn't another team with a different loss amount from canterbury wizards who also has a different loss amount than auckland aces and central districts stags. \n\nHowever, looking closer at the numbers we have: 2 (auckland aces), 3 (northern districts, canterbury wizards) , 4 (central districts stags), and 5 (otago volts).
