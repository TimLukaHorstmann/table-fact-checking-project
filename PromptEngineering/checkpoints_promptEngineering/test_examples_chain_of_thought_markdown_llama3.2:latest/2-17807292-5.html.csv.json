    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the ranking**: First, let's identify where Camilo Villegas from Colombia and David Toms from the United States are ranked. According to the table, they are both ranked 9th.\n\n2. **Determine their scores**: Next, we need to determine if Camilo Villegas and David Toms have the same score to par. From the table, we can see that:\n   - Camilo Villegas has a score of 74 + 72 = 146.\n   - David Toms has a score of 72 + 69 + 72 = 213.\n\n3. **Analyze scores**: However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement: \"Camilo Villegas from Colombia and david tom from the united state tie for eighth place with +4 to par\". If they were tied for 8th place, their scores should be equal.\n   - But according to the table, David Toms is actually ranked 9th (not 8th) with a score of 213.\n   - Camilo Villegas' score of 146 doesn't even match this condition.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since we cannot find any information that matches the claim \"Camilo Villegas from Colombia and david tom from the united state tie for eighth place with +4 to par\" due to their respective scores, the correct answer must be FALSE.\n\n\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the ranking\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine their scores\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze scores\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"ranking\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
