We need to find this specific information in the table.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the relevant row(s) for the claim\nLooking at the table, we are interested in rows where \"competition\" is marked as \"friendly\". This will help us filter out competitions that are not part of Rafael M\u00e1rquez's international friendly matches.\n\n### Step 3: Check each relevant row for the desired score\nWe now look through each relevant row (where competition is friendly) and check if any of these rows have a score of exactly 3 goals scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez. This will confirm if the claim can be true or false based on our findings.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the specific row in question for the desired score\nFor each relevant row, we verify that Rafael M\u00e1rquez is indeed listed as the player and that his score matches the condition mentioned in the claim. We also look to confirm how many goals he scored overall if we find a match.\n\n\n### Step 5: Compile all findings into our JSON format output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"score\"}, \n    {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"score\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n### The JSON output concludes our step-by-step reasoning process.",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Analyze the claim\nThe claim states that \"2000 be the only year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\". This means we need to check if Rafael M\u00e4rquez scored more than one goal in any international match outside of 2000.\n\n### Step 2: Check the years 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013\nFrom the table, there is no record of Rafael M\u00e4rquez scoring more than one goal in these years. Therefore, we can conclude that he did not score more than one goal in any of these years.\n\n### Step 3: Check the year 2010\nAccording to the table, Rafael M\u00e4rquez scored 1-1 against another team in a 2010 FIFA World Cup match. This means he scored exactly one goal in this match.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on our findings\nSince we have found that Rafael M\u00e4rquez did not score more than one goal in any international competition outside of 2000, and also that there is evidence of him scoring one goal in a 2010 match, it seems counterintuitive to say \"only\" he scored more than 1 goal. But given the instruction's meaning of being the only year he did so in an international setting, we must focus on his performance within those specific settings.\n\n\n### Step 5: Final Analysis\nRafael M\u00e4rquez did not score more than one goal in any year outside of 2000 according to our analysis, and within that framework, a single goal is considered less than the threshold stated in the claim. Thus the claim does stand as correct according to our evaluation.\n\n### Step 6: Output final answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To verify this, we need to find the row(s) where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal and also check if Mexico lost that match.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that Rafael M\u00e1rquez is involved in multiple matches (rows 1, 4, 6, 7, 12), but we only care about rows where Mexico loses.\n4. In row 8, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, and Mexico lost with a score of 1-2 after extra time. This suggests that the claim might be true for this specific match.\n5. However, in row 11, Rafael M\u00e1rquez also scored a goal, but Mexico won the match (1-1) in regular time.\n6.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim. The claim states that \"rafael m\u00e1rquez do not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012\". This means we need to check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez was scoreless in any of these years.\n\n2. Next, let's find relevant information from the table.\n   - In order to determine whether Rafael M\u00e1rquez remained scoreless in a match, we will look at the \"score\" column and the \"result\" column because we need both data points for this analysis.\n\n3. Now, let's analyze each year separately:\n   - 2001: Let's check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez played any matches that had a score of 0-0.\n     - There is no relevant entry in the table for 2001.\n\n\n   - 2009: Check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez played any matches with a score of 0-0.\n     - There is no relevant entry in the table for 2009.\n\n\n   - 2012: Look for matches that had both a \"score\" and a \"result\".\n     - We have an entry on June 12, 2011 but also one on October 30, 2013 that has a score of 0-0.\n   \n4. Determine the final result based on all steps above.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
