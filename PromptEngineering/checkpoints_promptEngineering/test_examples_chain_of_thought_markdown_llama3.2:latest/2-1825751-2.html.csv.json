First, I need to determine which years between 1973 and 1986 have a value of \"still not part of bb pilipinas\" in the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column.\n\n2. Looking at the table, I see that there are two values of \"still not part of bb pilipinas\" for the year 1984, which is outside the range of 1973-1986. Therefore, this value should be excluded from consideration.\n\n3. For the years between 1973 and 1986 (inclusive), we can see that there are no values of \"still not part of bb pilipinas\" in the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column for those years.\n\n4. However, there is a value of \"not awarded\" in the same column for some years, which indicates that this category was not applicable for those years.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the claim about \"binibining pilipinas - tourism say still not part of bb pilipinas from 1973 thru 1986\" is true because there are no values of \"still not part of bb pilipinas\" in that column for any year between 1973 and 1986.\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the years of interest\nThe claim mentions three winners, Anjanette Abayari (1974), Maria Lourdes Gonzalez (1975), and Mariah Margarita Moran (not mentioned but used as a reference). We need to look at the columns for these years.\n\n### Step 2: Find the year of Selina Manalad's win\nWe know that Selina Manalad won Binibining Pilipinas-Tourism in 1991, so we should check this column. However, her win is not relevant to the first runner-up position. The claim is about the first runner-up position.\n\n### Step 3: Find the year of Jennette Fernando's win\nJennette Fernando was the second runner-up when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won Binibining Pilipinas-International and Binibining Pilipinas-Universe, respectively. However, we are looking for first runner-ups.\n\n### Step 4: Find the year of Selina Manalad's win as a second runner-up\nSelina Manalad was the second runner-up in Binibining Pilipinas when Maria Patricia Betita won Binibining Pilipinas-Universe. Again, this is not the first runner-up position.\n\n### Step 5: Find the correct year for Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando's win as a second runner-up\nIn 1991, Selina Manalad was awarded Binibining Pilipinas-Tourism (not mentioned in the claim), while Jennette Fernando won Binibinging Pilipinas-International. Neither of them is relevant for the first runner-up position.\n\n### Step 6: Recheck the claim to look for another source or possible misinterpretation\nAfter rechecking, it seems that there might be an error in our interpretation of how the years and winners were mentioned in the table. However, we have only been able to find information about Selina Manalad as a second runner-up.\n\n### Step 7: Identify the first runner-ups that match the binibining pilipinas - international year with corresponding Binibining Pilipinas-universe year\nIn order for Selina and Jennette to be mentioned as the first runners up, we need to look at the correct years of Anjanette Abayari (1974) and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez (1975). Unfortunately, their corresponding Binibining Pilipinas-Tourism years are not mentioned in our table.\n\n### Step 8: Determine if there is a match\nGiven that there isn't any information about the first runner-up position in the year of Anjanette Abayari's win and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez's win, we cannot verify the claim. But then, notice the 1991 row for Selina Manalad.\n\n### Step 9: Determine if Jennette Fernando was a first runner up\nWhen we find that Jennette Fernando won Binibining Pilipinas-International in 1991 and Anjanette Abayari won Binibining Pilipinas-Universe in the same year, there is a match for her.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLooking at our steps above, it seems like we have found an issue with how we interpreted the information in the table. The correct first runner-ups can't be determined given that their corresponding Binibining Pilipinas-Tourism years are not mentioned. However, Jennette Fernando's win as a second runner-up and Selina Manalad's win don't help us here either.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude the following:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the years of interest\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Find the year of Selina Manalad's win\",\n      \"text\": \"not relevant to first runner-up position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Find the year of Jennette Fernando's win\",\n      \"text\": \"first runner-up position is not her win year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 4: Find the year of Selina Manalad's win as a second runner-up\",\n      \"text\": \"same issue as before\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 5: Find the correct year for Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando's win as a second runner-up\",\n      \"text\": \"not relevant to first runner-up position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 6: Recheck the claim to look for another source or possible misinterpretation\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 7: Identify the first runner-ups that match the binibining pilipinas - international year with corresponding Binibining Pilipinas-universe year\",\n      \"text\": \"no relevant information in table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 8: Determine if there is a match\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 9: Determine if Jennette Fernando was a first runner up\",\n      \"text\": \"the claim that Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were the first runners-ups when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez win Binibining Pilipinas-Universe is incorrect\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Hence, we can say that 'binibining pilipinas - tourism' do not start not until the year 1987 because the category itself did not begin in the records provided.\n\n#### Step 3: There's a claim that 'binibining pilipinas - tourism does not start until the year 1987'\n\nBased on our observation, since there are entries under 'binibining pilipinas - tourism' for years after 1985 (i.e., 1988 and onward), we need to check if these were given in 1987 specifically.\n\n#### Step 4: Confirm that binibining pilipinas - tourism award was not given until 1988\n\nLooking at the record for year 1988, 'binibining pilipinas - tourism' does have a winner. This confirms our observation from step 3 and completes our analysis.\n\n#### Step 5: Compile all observations into one conclusion\n\nBased on steps 1 through 4, we see that there are instances of binibining pilipinas - tourism not being awarded until after the year 1987, but specifically for the year 1988. This means that 'binibining pilipinas - tourism' award was given in earlier years than 1987.\n\n#### Step 6: Final assessment\n\nSince our observation is contradictory to the claim made, we conclude that the claim \"binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start not until the year 1987\" is False.\n\n#### Step 7: Identifying relevant cells for JSON output\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": null,\n            \"column_name\": null\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": null,\n            \"column_name\": \"Still not part of BB Pilipinas\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1975, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1985, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"Still not part of BB Pilipinas\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1975, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1985, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about Maria Lourdes Enriquez losing as Binibining Pilipinas - International the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson did:\n\n1. The claim suggests that there was a year gap between Jessie Alice Salones Dixson winning as Binibining Pilipinas - International and Maria Lourdes Enriquez losing in the same page.\n2. To verify this, we need to check the winning years of both contestants. \n3. We can find Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's year by finding the row with column \"Binibining pilipinas - international\" that contains her name.\n4. We can do the same for Maria Lourdes Enriquez and see if there is a year gap between their winning years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Claim suggests a year gap\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check the winning years of Jessie Alice Salones Dixson and Maria Lourdes Enriquez\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's winning year by finding the row with column Binibining pilipinas - international that contains her name\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1986,\n          \"column_name\": \"Binibining pilipinas - international\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Find Maria Lourdes Enriquez' winning year by finding the row with column Binibining pilipinas - international that contains her name\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1987,\n          \"column_name\": \"Binibining pilipinas - international\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Check if there is a year gap between Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's and Maria Lourdes Enriquez' winning years\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1986,\n          \"column_name\": \"year\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1987,\n          \"column_name\": \"year\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is in the format of a JSON object.",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the relevant information\nFirst, we need to find out who won Binibining Pilipinas - Universe for both years when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez are mentioned as winners. We can see from the table that in 1991, both Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were second runner-ups.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if Anjanette Abayari won Binibining Pilipinas - Universe\nLooking at the relevant rows for Binibining Pilipinas - Universe, we can see that Anjanette Abayari indeed won in 1991. So, she is correct according to her row.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won Binibining Pilipinas - Universe\nSimilarly, we can also verify that Maria Lourdes Gonzalez did not win Binibining Pilipinas - Universe in 1991 according to the table.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando\u2019s positions when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won\nWe already know from step 3 that Maria Lourdes Gonzalez did not win Binibining Pilipinas - Universe in 1991. Thus, we can say from the table that both Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were second runner-ups when Anjanette Abayari was the winner of Binibining Pilipinas - Universe.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify if Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won Binibining Pilipinas - Universe\nWe also need to check if Maria Lourdes Gonzalez is correct according to her row. However, looking at her relevant rows in the table, it can be seen that she did not win Binibining Pilipinas - Universe.\n\n#### Step 6: Confirming answer based on steps above\nBased on all our steps, we know that both Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were second runner-ups when Anjanette Abayari won Binibining Pilipinas - Universe. But Maria Lourdes Gonzalez did not win in that year.\n\n#### Step 7: Final answer based on analysis above\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it says that Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were the second runner-ups when both Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won Binibining Pilipinas - Universe.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - universe\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\": \"second runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\": \"first runner - up\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - universe\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"second runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"first runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}",

For each instance, compare the year with the award date to determine if it's true or false that `binibining pilipinas - tourism` does not start until 1989.\n\n4.
