We can do this by looking at the relevant cell: `order 1 | a modest proposal   | august 3 , 2010  | ...`. The column name is `episode` and the row index is 1.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if the U.S. Air Date of episode \"No Strings Attached\" matches the date mentioned in the claim. We can do this by looking at the relevant cell: `order 2 | no strings attached | august 3 , 2010  | ...`. The column name is `episode` and the row index is 2.\n\n3. Since both episodes have the same U.S. Air Date, we need to verify if the claim mentions the exact date format used in the table (i.e., \"august 3, 2010\"). We can do this by checking if the column names `us air date` and the values in the corresponding cells match the claimed date format.\n\n4. If both conditions from steps 2 and 3 are met, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n5. To be thorough, we should also check if there are any other episodes with a different U.S. Air Date that might be mentioned in the claim but not in the table.
