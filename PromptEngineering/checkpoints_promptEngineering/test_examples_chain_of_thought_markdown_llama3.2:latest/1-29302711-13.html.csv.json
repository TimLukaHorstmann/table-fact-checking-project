Check if Arthur Ashe won 26 matches: According to the table, Arthur Ashe played 36 matches, so he did not win 26 matches. This eliminates part of the claim.\n\n2. Check if Marty Riesen wins 26 match: The table says that Marty Riesen played 36 matches and won 26 matches. So, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n\n3. Since one of two conditions in the statement was proven false, we need to analyze if there are any other statements in the claim being true.\n\n4. Analyze the entire statement \"Arthur Ashe and Marty Rissen both win 26 match each\" from step 2: The claim should say \"each\" instead of \"both\".

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. Check if Roscoe Tanner has a matches played value greater than 0, since it's impossible to play any matches without actually playing them. Tanner has 27 matches played.\n\n2. Since Tanner has a non-zero number of matches played, we move on to checking his ranking. The table shows the rank (rk) for each player, and we're interested in verifying that Roscoe Tanner is indeed ranked ninth.\n\n3. We examine the value in cell (9, rk), which corresponds to Roscoe Tanner's row index 9. According to the table, Tanner's rank is \"9\".\n\n4. The claim states that Roscoe Tanner was the ninth rank tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit. Since we've verified that his rank matches the number 9 and we have a non-zero number of matches played, this supports the claim.\n\n5. However, there is another cell (9, name) in row index 9, which should match the player's actual name, not their rank. Tanner's name is \"roscoe tanner\", so this also seems to support the claim.\n\n6. We now examine the values in cells (4, matches played), (5, matches played), and (7, matches played) for players with an identical number of matches won to Roscoe Tanner (16). The player ranked 9 has a higher number of matches won than Tanner.\n \n7. According to the table, for the row where the player's rank is \"4\", we find that there are two other names that match, and their value in the \"name\" column is \"mark cox\". Therefore, this seems to support the claim.\n\nHowever, looking closer at cell (9, name), we notice that \"roscoe tanner\" does not equal \"tanner\".\n \n8. Lastly, we look again at Tanner's matches played, which are 27. For a player ranked ninth on the 1973 world tennis circuit, their actual ranking should be lower than that.\n \nBased on our detailed analysis of the table values provided and the steps taken in this reasoning process, we can conclude the following:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Roscoe Tanner has a non-zero number of matches played (27)\"}, \n    {\"step\": \"Roscoe Tanner's rank is indeed 9\"}, \n    {\"step\": \"Tanner's name in cell (9, name) does not match 'roscoe tanner'\"}], \n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\", \n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"matches played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}",

Now, let's look at the prize money won by Ken Rosewall:\n   * Ken Rosewall's Prize Money = 66400\n\n5. To determine if the claim is true or false, we will compare Ken Rosewall's prize money with their combined prize money:\n   * If Ken Rosewall's prize money is greater than their combined prize money, then the claim is FALSE.\n   * Otherwise, the claim is TRUE.\n\n6.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the total prize money won by Tom Okker\nTo determine if Ken Rosewall loses more prize money than Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner combine, we first need to calculate the total prize money won by Tom Okker.\n\nAccording to the table, Tom Okker has a prize money of $34400.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the total prize money won by Roscoe Tanner\nNext, we calculate the total prize money won by Roscoe Tanner.\n\nAccording to the table, Roscoe Tanner has a prize money of $25250.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the combined prize money won by Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner\nTo find the combined prize money won by both players, we add their individual prize money amounts:\n\n$34400 (Tom Okker) + $25250 (Roscoe Tanner) = $59650\n\n### Step 4: Identify Ken Rosewall's total prize money\nNow that we have the combined prize money of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner, let's look at Ken Rosewall's total prize money:\n\nKen Rosewall has a total prize money of $66400.\n\n### Step 5: Compare Ken Rosewall's prize money to the combined prize money of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner\nSince Ken Rosewall's total prize money ($66400) is greater than the combined prize money of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner ($59650), we can conclude that Ken Rosewall does not lose more prize money.\n\n### Step 6: Determine if the claim is True or False\n\nBased on our comparison, the claim \"Ken Rosewell loses more prize money than Tom Ekker and Roscoe Tanner combine\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"prize money (usd)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
