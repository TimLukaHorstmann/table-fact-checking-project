    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that the Deacons were shutout 3 times during the season.\n2. To verify this, we need to find rows in the table where the \"result\" column is equal to a value that indicates a shutout (e.g., \"w 0 - X\", \"l 0 - X\").\n3. We can assume that any win with no score listed (\"w\") does not indicate a shutout.\n4. Looking at the table, we see that there are several games where the Deacons lost with a result in the format of \"l x - y\". These could potentially be shutouts if y is 0 or if the opponent's score (x) is 0. We need to check these results for accuracy.\n5. The relevant cells for this task can be found in the rows where \"result\" indicates a loss, with an opponent's score of 0 (\"l 0 - X\") or a shutout (\"l X - 0\").\n6. By examining each row, we see that only one result is a clear shutout: 11 / 25 / 1972, where the \"result\" column reads \"l 9 - 44\". This means that the Deacons were shutout exactly once during the season.\n7.

We will check if there are 3 games where the Deacon loses, and we will also check the difference between the opponent's score (y) and the Deacon's score (x).\n5. The difference between the two scores can be calculated by subtracting x from y.\n\nHere is the relevant data:\n\n| row_index | column_name    | value           |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 0         | result          | w 26 - 20       |\n| 1         | result          | l 10 - 56      |\n| 2         | result          | l 6 - 45       |\n| 3         | result          | l 0 - 23       |\n| 4         | result          | l 13 - 42     |\n| 5         | result          | l 0 - 21       |\n| 6         | result          | l 0 - 31       |\n| 7         | result          | l 3 - 35       |\n| 8         | result          | w 9 - 7        |\n| 9         | result          | l 12 - 15     |\n| 10        | result          | l 9 - 44       |\n\nWe can see that the Deacon loses in games 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. There are indeed 8 games where the Deacon lost, not 3.\n\nNow we need to calculate the differences between the opponent's score and the Deacon's score:\n\n- Game 1: 56 - 10 = 46 (more than 10 points)\n- Game 2: 45 - 6 = 39 (more than 10 points)\n- Game 3: 42 - 13 = 29 (more than 10 points)\n- Game 4: 23 - 0 = 23 (less than 10 points)\n- Game 5: 21 - 0 = 21 (less than 10 points)\n- Game 6: 31 - 0 = 31 (more than 10 points)\n- Game 7: 35 - 3 = 32 (more than 10 points)\n- Game 9: 15 - 12 = 3 (less than 10 points)\n\nWe can see that the Deacon was shutout 3 times, but not all of them were by more than 10 points.\n\nNow we need to identify the cells that represent this data:\n\n| row_index | column_name    | value           |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 0         | result          | w 26 - 20       |\n| 1         | result          | l 10 - 56      |\n| 2         | result          | l 6 - 45       |\n| 3         | result          | l 0 - 23       |\n| 4         | result          | l 13 - 42     |\n| 5         | result          | l 0 - 21       |\n| 6         | result          | l 0 - 31       |\n| 7         | result          | l 3 - 35       |\n| 8         | result          | w 9 - 7        |\n| 9         | result          | l 12 - 15     |\n| 10        | result          | l 9 - 44       |\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We need to find out if the Deacon was shutout 3 times, but never by more than 10 points.\\nTo do this, we need to look at each game where the Deacon lost.\\nA loss with a score is in the format \\u201cx - y\\u201d, where x is the Deacon's score and y is the opponent's score.\\nWe will check if there are 3 games where the Deacon loses, and we will also check the difference between the opponent's score (y) and the Deacon's score (x).\\nThe difference between the two scores can be calculated by subtracting x from y.\\n\\nThe relevant data is:\\n| row_index | column_name    | value           |\\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|\\n| 0         | result          | w 26 - 20       |\\n| 1         | result          | l 10 - 56      |\\n| 2         | result          | l 6 - 45       |\\n| 3         | result          | l 0 - 23       |\\n| 4         | result          | l 13 - 42     |\\n| 5         | result          | l 0 - 21       |\\n| 6         | result          | l 0 - 31       |\\n| 7         | result          | l 3 - 35       |\\n| 8         | result          | w 9 - 7        |\\n| 9         | result          | l 12 - 15     |\\n| 10        | result          | l 9 - 44       |\\n\\nWe can see that the Deacon loses in games 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
