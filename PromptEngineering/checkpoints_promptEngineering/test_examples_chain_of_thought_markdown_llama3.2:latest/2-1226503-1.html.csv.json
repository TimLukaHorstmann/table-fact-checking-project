Looking at the table, we see that there are two rows for the year 1982: one with entrant \"arrows racing team\" and chassis \"arrows a4\", and another with the same information but chassis \"arrows a5\".\n\n3. We then check if Mauro Baldi was present in either of these rows.\n\n4. Looking at the engines listed, we see that for both rows in 1982, the engine is \"cosworth v8\". However, to confirm if Mauro Baldi drove for Arrow Racing Team in 1982, we would need to look at a different table or source where his names are paired with these chassis and engine combinations.\n\n5. Since the problem statement does not provide this information, we can't definitively determine that Mauro Baldi was part of the Arrow Racing Team for both races in 1982 based on the provided table alone.\n\n6. However, it is known from historical records that Mauro Baldi did drive for the Arrows team in 1982, using the chassis \"A4\" with engine \"Cosworth V8\". For the \"A5\" car he used the same engine.\n\n7. Therefore, based on this external knowledge and comparing entries for 1982 year, we can infer that Mauro Baldi was part of Arrow Racing Team in both races in 1982.\n\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}",
