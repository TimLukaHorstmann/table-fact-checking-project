First, we need to understand what the claim is saying: it claims that Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy are the only players to score a + 1 to par.\n\n2. Next, let's examine the table for players who scored a + 1 to par. We can see in cell t3-1 that Kenneth Ferrie scored 71+70=141, which is not + 1 to par (it's actually +1). In cell t3-2, Geoff Ogilvy scored 71+70=141, which also doesn't meet the criteria because it has a + 1. However, we see that both Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy have scores of 141.\n\n3. Now let's review other players. For instance in cell t5-1 Jim Furyk had score 70+72=142, which is not + 1 to par (it has a +2). In the same row P\u00e1draig Harrington scored 70+72=142 and also doesn't meet the criteria because it has a + 2. Then we look at cell t7-1 Jason Dufner with score 72+71=143, which is not +1 to par (it's actually +3). \n\n4. We've checked all relevant cells and found that Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy do indeed have a + 1 to par but no one else does.\n\n5.

P\u00e1draig Harrington's score is 70 + 72 = 142 and Graeme McDowell's score is 71 + 72 = 143. Since they have the same country (Ireland), if p\u00e1draig harrington has the same country as him (not true) then his score would be better than or equal to McDowells. Therefore, we can conclude that if his score is indeed better then McDowelld's, then he also must be a fron runner from Northern Ireland.\n\n3. Lastly, we look at the table for the scores of both players and see if their total matches with their par.

The score for each player is given by the sum of their \"score\" and \"to par\". \n\n- For Steve Stricker, the score is (70 + 69) = 139.\n- For Colin Montgomerie, the score is (69 + 71) = 140.\n- For Kenneth Ferrie, the score is (71 + 70) = 141.\n- For Geoff Ogilvy, the score is (71 + 70) = 141.\n- For Jim Furyk, the score is (70 + 72) = 142.\n- For P\u00e1draig Harrington, the score is (70 + 72) = 142.\n- For Jason Dufner, the score is (72 + 71) = 143.\n- For Graeme McDowell, the score is (71 + 72) = 143.\n- For Phil Mickelson, the score is (70 + 73) = 143.\n- For Arron Oberholser, the score is (75 + 68) = 143.\n\n### Step 2: Identify players with the lowest score\nBased on the extracted scores, we can now identify which player(s) have the lowest score. \n\n- Steve Stricker has a score of 139.\n- Colin Montgomerie has a score of 140.\n- Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy both have a score of 141.\n- Jim Furyk and P\u00e1draig Harrington both have a score of 142.\n- Jason Dufner, Graeme McDowell, Phil Mickelson, and Arron Oberholser all have a score of 143.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if Steve Stricker has the lowest score\nFrom our previous step, we can see that while Steve Stricker's score is 139, there are other players who also have this same score. \n\n- For example, Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy both have a score of 141 which is higher than Steve Stricker's score.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince we found that Steve Stricker does not have the lowest score among all the players (his score being tied with other players who have a higher score), we can conclude that the claim \"steve stricker of united state have the lowest score among all the player\" is FALSE. \n\n### JSON Response\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Extracted scores from the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identified players with the lowest score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Determined if Steve Stricker has the lowest score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
