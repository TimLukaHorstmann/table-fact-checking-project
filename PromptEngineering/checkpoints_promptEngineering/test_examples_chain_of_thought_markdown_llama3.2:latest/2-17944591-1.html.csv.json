To determine whether Andy Turner scored more total goals than Pat Scully, we need to first find their total goal counts from the table.\n2. We locate the relevant cells for both players: \n   - For Andy Turner: The total apps cell is 23 (14) but it only contains one value which refers to \"total apps\" under name 'andy turner' with a row index of 2 and column name 'total goals'. So, the value we need is in the cell located at row index 2 and column name 'total goals'. The value here is 1. \n   - For Pat Scully: The total apps cell is 28 but it only contains one value which refers to \"total apps\" under name 'pat scully' with a row index of 25 and column name 'total goals'. So, the value we need is in the cell located at row index 25 and column name 'total goals'. The value here is 1. \n3. Since Andy Turner has a total goal count of 1 while Pat Scully also has a total goal count of 1, their total goal counts are equal.\n4. If two or more players have the same number of total goals, we must look further into other data in order to decide if one scored more than another.\n\nBased on step 4, let us find out how many total apps both players had.\n\n5. Andy Turner: The total apps cell is 2 (3) but it only contains two values which refers to \"total apps\" under name 'andy turner' with a row index of 2 and column name 'total apps'. So the value we need is in the cell located at row index 2 and column name 'total apps'. The value here is 2.\n   - Pat Scully: The total apps cell is 25 but it only contains one value which refers to \"total apps\" under name 'pat scully' with a row index of 25 and column name 'total apps'. So the value we need is in the cell located at row index 25 and column name 'total apps'. The value here is 28.\n6. Pat Scully had more total apps (28) than Andy Turner (2), which suggests that, on average, he scored more goals per game.\n7.

For the claim to be true, both Andy Booth and Ronnie Jepson must have a total of less than or equal to 10 goals in that season.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Andy Booth's data\nAndy Booth has 43 league apps with 16 league goals. To determine his total goal count from the 1995-96 season, we need to find which row corresponds to that year.\n\n#### Step 4: Locate Andy Booth's row for the 1995-96 season\nAfter reviewing the table, we see that Andy Booth has a row with \"43\" (11) in the league apps column, indicating he played in that season. We also see another row with \"(3)\" (1) indicating this is the same player from the previous season but played more games in this year.\n\n#### Step 5: Calculate Andy Booth's total goals for the 1995-96 season\nSince we can't find any other data about his league apps or fa cup apps specifically for that year, and given there are multiple rows with different apps numbers, it seems difficult to accurately calculate. \n\n#### Step 6: Analyze Ronnie Jepson's data\nRonnie Jepson has 40 (3) league apps which would be the same row number as above but with the \"(3)\" in parentheses on that line.\n\n#### Step 7: Calculate Ronnie Jepson's total goals for the 1995-96 season\nSimilar to Andy Booth, we can't accurately determine Ronnie Jepson's goal count without additional information about his league apps or fa cup apps specifically for that year. But he does have a row with \"(3)\" in parentheses next to his name.\n\n#### Step 8: Check other relevant rows\nWe need to look at the \"total goals\" column for both players and see if they only scored 10 total goals in the 1995-96 season.\n\n#### Step 9: Calculate their total goals from the entire table\nAfter reviewing the data, we can't find any information that would allow us to calculate Andy Booth's total goal count or Ronnie Jepson's total goal count specifically for the 1995-96 season without making assumptions about which row to use. Therefore, it is not possible to verify if they scored only 10 total goals in the 1995-96 season.\n\n#### Step 10: Determine the answer\nSince we can't accurately calculate Andy Booth's and Ronnie Jepson's goal counts for that year due to lack of information, we cannot confirm whether their claim is true or false. However, based on our analysis it seems they must have scored more than 10 goals as there isn't a way to verify otherwise.\n\n#### Step 11: Determine relevant cells\nBased on the previous steps, without accurate data on Andy Booth's and Ronnie Jepson's goal counts specifically for the 1995-96 season we cannot determine which row(s) of these players is/are most relevant based solely on information available in the table.\n\n\n#### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"To determine whether the claim about Andy Booth and Ronnie Jepson scoring only 10 total goals in the 1995-96 season, we need to find their total goal counts from that season.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"We need to look at the league apps and total goals columns for each player.

Upon reviewing the table, we can see that there is indeed one cell with Lee Sinnott in the role of fw.\n\n3. **Determine if Simon Trevitt's role is correct**: Next, we should verify if Simon Trevitt's role is indeed df. We find that all cells for Simon Trevitt list him as a df.\n\n4. **Check for any discrepancies in roles or values**: After verifying Lee Sinnott and Simon Trevitt's roles, there are no other discrepancies to check.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on our findings, the claim is FALSE because Lee Sinnott should be listed as a fw, not a df.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"role\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
