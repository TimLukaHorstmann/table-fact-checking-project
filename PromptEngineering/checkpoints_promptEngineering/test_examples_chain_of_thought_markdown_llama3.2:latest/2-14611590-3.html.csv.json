We can find the ranking of both players by looking at the \"rank\" column in the table.\n3. According to the table, Greg Norman's rank is 1 and Billy Mayfair's rank is 2.\n4. Since Greg Norman has a lower rank (1) compared to Billy Mayfair (2), we need to consider if there are any other factors that could affect their ranking in the 1995 PGA Tour.\n5. To do this, let's look for the \"events\" and \"wins\" columns to see if either player had more events or wins in the 1995 PGA Tour.\n6. Upon examining these columns, we see that Billy Mayfair participated in more events (28) compared to Greg Norman (16), but they have the same number of wins (2).\n7. Since there's no information about which player performed better within those events or had a higher overall score in the 1995 PGA Tour, their rankings seem to be based solely on total earnings.\n8. According to the table, Billy Mayfair has lower total earnings ($1543192) compared to Greg Norman ($1654959).\n9.

We look at the table and find their rows:\n   - For Greg Norman: The row is `rank 1` with the values in columns \"player\", \"country\", \"earnings\", \"events\", and \"wins\".\n     - This tells us that Greg Norman has a rank of 1, a country of Australia, earnings of 1654959, 16 events participated, and wins 3.\n   - For Lee Janzen: The row is `rank 3` with the same values in columns \"player\", \"country\", \"earnings\", \"events\", and \"wins\".\n     - This tells us that Lee Janzen has a rank of 3, a country of United States, earnings of 1378966, 28 events participated, and wins 3.\n3. Next, we check if Greg Norman's wins are limited to only 1 win in the 1995 PGA Tour.\n   - To do this, we can look at his row again (`rank 1`) but with an emphasis on \"wins\" column:\n     - We see that his total number of wins is indeed 3. However, without direct information regarding specific tournaments such as the 1995 PGA Tour, this information alone isn't conclusive.\n4. Then, we check if Lee Janzen's wins are limited to only 1 win in the 1995 PGA Tour:\n   - We do the same process as before: checking `rank 3` for \"wins\":\n     - Lee Janzen's total number of wins is indeed 3. Similar to Greg Norman, there isn't specific information about whether one of those was in 1995 or not.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that we can\u2019t accurately determine which of their 3 wins were in the 1995 PGA tour without further data (like specific tournament dates), we cannot confirm if Greg Norman and Lee Janzen only have 1 win in the 1995 PGA Tour.
