Looking at the table, we can see that there are two managers with rank 2: Alex Ferguson and Miguel Mu\u00f1oz. We also notice that Jupp Heynckes has a rank of 4.\n\n3. Since there is no manager ranked lower than both Alex Ferguson (rank 2) and Miguel Mu\u00f1oz (rank 2), we can conclude that the comparison between these two managers will only determine which one outranks Jupp Heynckes.\n\n4. Now, let's compare the ranks of Alex Ferguson and Miguel Mu\u00f1oz. Both have a rank of 2, so it's not clear who is higher based on their individual rankings alone.\n\n5. However, we also notice that there are managers with lower ranks (e.g., Jos\u00e9p Guardiola has a rank of 9).

This means that if both Alex Ferguson and Miguel Mu\u00f1oz were to be ranked below this manager, then they would both outrank Jupp Heynckes.\n\n7. Since both Alex Ferguson and Miguel Mu\u00f1oz have a rank of 2, it is not possible for them to be ranked lower than Jos\u00e9p Guardiola (rank 9).

To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of years won by Helenio Herrera and Ernst Happel.\n3. According to the table, both managers have 1 year won in the \"years won\" column.\n4. However, looking at the same row, it is mentioned that there are no runners-up, only clubs won.\n5. The claim says one manager is better than another based on some criteria we cannot directly find from this data (years won with and without runner up included). It might be referring to years won in total, but without more information about what \"better\" means, such as which statistic of the managers they beat or lost to is being compared.\n6. However, a manager can be considered better based on their total number of wins across all categories (years with and without runner-up included) if their wins are higher than that of another manager.\n\n7. Looking at the relevant cell data:\n   * Helenio Herrera: \n     - \"clubs won\" = 2\n     - \"years won\" = [1960, 1965]\n   * Ernst Happel: \n     - \"clubs won\" = 3\n     - \"years won\" = [1970, 1983]\n\n8.
