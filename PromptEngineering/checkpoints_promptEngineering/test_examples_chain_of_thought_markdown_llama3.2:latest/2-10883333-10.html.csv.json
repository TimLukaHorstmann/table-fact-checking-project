This implies that we need to find the row with the highest total score for North Melbourne in the table.\n2. We can start by looking at the row corresponding to North Melbourne: `| away team       | away team score   | ... | north melbourne | 17.19 (121)       | ...`\n3. In this row, we see that the \"away team score\" for North Melbourne is 17.19, which includes both the total goals and behinds. The column to the right of the score might give us additional information about the game, but it doesn't seem relevant to determining if this is the highest score.\n4. Since there are multiple rows corresponding to different home teams, we can look for any other row that also has North Melbourne as its away team. We find another row: `| geelong     | 14.20 (104)       | melbourne       | 14.14 (98)        | ...`\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim being made: \"fitzroy have a higher score than footscray\".\n2. To verify this claim, we must compare the scores of fitzroy and footscray.\n3. According to the table, the score for fitzroy is 15.7 (97), while the score for footscray is 13.11 (89).\n4. Comparing these two values: \n    - The numerical value for fitzroy is greater than that of footscray because 97 > 89\n    - However, we must remember that scores can include multiple parts (whole numbers and decimals). To accurately compare the scores:\n        a) In both cases, there's a whole number part.\n        b) In both cases, the whole number part is less than the decimal part.\n5. Considering this structure for comparison:\n    - Both teams' numerical value (without considering decimals) are already 89 and 97 respectively\n    - So we need to consider the decimal part for accurate comparison\n6. Comparing the scores with decimal parts: \n    - Fitzy has a 7, which is greater than Footscray's 1.\n    - Therefore, fitzroy (15.7) has a higher score overall because of its greater whole number value and the additional 7 in its decimal part compared to footscray\n7.
