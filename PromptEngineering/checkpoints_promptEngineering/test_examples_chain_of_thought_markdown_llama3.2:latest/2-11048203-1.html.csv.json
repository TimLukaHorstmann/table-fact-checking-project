This can be done by counting the number of 'win' cells in the table.\nFrom the table, we see that Hatem Aqel won in the following matches:\n- 17 october 2003  | amman     | 1 - 0   | win      | 2004 afc asian cup qualification \n- 18 february 2004 | amman     | 5 - 0   | win      | 2006 fifa world cup qualification\n- 14 february 2006 | amman     | 2 - 0   | win      | friendly                         \n- 22 february 2006 | amman     | 3 - 0   | win      | 2007 afc asian cup qualification \n- 28 october 2013  | amman     | 1 - 0   | win      | friendly                         \n\n### Step 2: List all losses\nWe also need to find the total number of losses.

In this case, Hatem Aqel won 5 times and lost 2 times.\n\nSince 5 is greater than 2, there is at least one more win than loss.\n\n### Step 4: Determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nThe given statement says \"hatem aqel have 1 more win than he have loss\".

The claim states that Hatem Aqel competed in a competition that started on December 16, 2003, and ended on October 28, 2013.\n\n### Step 2: Finding the start date of the claimed competition\nThe table shows multiple competitions for Hatem Aqel. We need to find the one that matches the claim's start date, which is December 16, 2002.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing the dates\nLooking at the table, we can see that on December 16, 2002, Hatem Aqel played in the 2002 Arab Nations Cup. This suggests that the competition might be this one, but we need to confirm if it started exactly on December 16, 2003.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the end date of the claimed competition\nAccording to the claim, the competition ended on October 28, 2013. To verify this, we need to find a match in the table that has an end date around this time.\n\n### Step 5: Comparing with actual dates\nAfter examining the table again, we can see that there is no direct match for the claimed start and end dates. However, since the claim says \"end on october 28, 2013\", it seems more like a confusion in terms, as Hatem Aqel's first match after the stated year was on 9 september 2009, where he lost to a friendly match, and then another match against the same type of friendly which took place also after 9th September 2009 . \n\n### Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, it seems that there is some confusion in terms with the claim. The start date matches the table (December 16, 2002), but there isn't a clear indication for the end date being October 28, 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim states that Hatem Aqel competed in a competition that started on December 16, 2003, and ended on October 28, 2013.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the start date of the claimed competition\",\n      \"description\": \"December 16, 2002, in the 2002 Arab Nations Cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the dates\",\n      \"description\": \"It seems like a match for the start date, but not the end date.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the end date of the claimed competition\",\n      \"description\": \"There isn't a direct match for October 28, 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion\",\n      \"description\": \"Based on analysis, there is confusion in terms with the claim.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
