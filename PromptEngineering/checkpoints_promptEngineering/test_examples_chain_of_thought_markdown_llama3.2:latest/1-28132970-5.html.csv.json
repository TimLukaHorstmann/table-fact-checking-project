Understand that if the claim is to be verified, it must specify which type of propulsion (controllable pitch propeller) is being referred to for vessels, or otherwise it is considered ambiguous.\n5.

Determine if there are any other vessels with controllable pitch propellers.\n7. Find out how many total vessels in the table indeed have \"prop\" or \"jet\" for their propulsion fields.\n8.

We can do this by looking at each row in the table and checking if the \"length\" column value is equal to 20 m.\n\nFrom the table, we see that:\n- gallion has a length of 20 m\n- gardian 1, gardian 2, gardian 7, and gardian 9 all have lengths of 20 m\n- marianarray has a length of 17 m\n- smeaton array has a length of 20 m\n\nSo, the only vessel that does not have a length of 20 m is marianarray.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if there is exactly one vessel with a length other than 20 m.\n4. We can do this by counting the number of vessels with lengths other than 20 m. In this case, there are two vessels: marianarray and smeaton array.\n\nSince there are more than one vessel with length not equal to 20m , we can't consider our claim TRUE\n\n5. Now we know that at least two vessels have a different length so our claim is false \n\n6. To verify the answer, we should check if all other conditions of the claim meet the requirement\n7. The given claim only mentions the length of vessels except 1 vessel , thus checking for all other values like breadth, speed etc are not required\n\n8.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant information**: The claim states that the vessel \"gallion\" has the lowest maximum speed of 26 knots.\n2. **Locate the gallion's data**: In the table, find the row with \"vessel\" equal to \"gallion\". This is at row index 1 and column name \"max speed\".\n3. **Extract the relevant data**: The max speed for the gallion is listed as 30 knots.\n4. **Compare with other vessels**: Since there are no other vessels with a lower max speed, we need to check if any of the other vessels have a lower max speed than 26 knots.\n5. **Check marianarray's max speed**: The marianarray has a max speed listed as 26 knots, which is less than the gallion's max speed.\n6. **Conclusion**: Since there are multiple vessels with a lower max speed (specifically 26 knots) and only one vessel (\"gallion\") with the same high max speed, the claim cannot be true.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"max speed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"max speed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"max speed\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"vessel\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"built\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"max speed\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
