Identify the row(s) in the table where Muhsin Corbbrey is listed as the opponent.\n   The relevant rows are:\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2006 - 09 - 15 | win      | ryan rayonec      | omar shrine temple       | mount pleasant , south carolina , usa | tko                  |       4 | 0:54   | 5 - 2 - 1 |\n| 2006 - 04 - 21 | win      | shelton barnes    | omar shrine temple       | mount pleasant , south carolina , usa | tko                  |       1 | 2:43   | 4 - 1 - 1 |\n```\n   The opponent is listed as \"ryan rayonec\" and \"shelton barnes\".\n\n2. For each row, check if the method of victory was by TKO (Technical Knockout).\n   In both cases, the method of victory was indeed by TKO.\n\n3. Check if the date range mentioned in the claim falls within the dates listed in these two rows.\n   The dates mentioned are 2005-11-26 and 2006-04-21, which fall outside the actual dates of the fights (2009 - 02 - 28 and 2006 - 09 - 15).\n\n4. However, we can also see that there is another row where Muhsin Corbbrey wins by TKO:\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2009 - 02 - 28 | win      | troy nelson       | shoreline ball room      | hilton head , south carolina , usa    | decision             |       6 | 3:00   | 6 - 2 - 1 |\n```\n   But this fight was a decision, not a TKO.\n\n5.

We find another row where Muhsin Corbbrey wins by TKO:\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2005 - 11 - 26 | win      | ben lock          | show place arena         | upper marlboro , maryland , usa       | decision (unanimous) |       4 | 3:00   | 1 - 1 - 1 |\n```\n   And\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2006 - 06 - 15 | loss     | tim coleman       | michael 's eighth avenue | glen burnie , maryland , usa          | decision (unanimous) |       6 | 3:00   | 4 - 2 - 1 |\n```\n   And\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2006 - 03 - 09 | win      | kareem robinson   | michael 's eighth avenue | glen burnie , maryland , usa          | decision (unanimous) |       4 | 3:00   | 3 - 1 - 1 |\n```\n   And\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2006 - 01 - 26 | win      | anthony abrams    | michael 's eighth avenue | glen burnie , maryland , usa          | decision (unanimous) |       4 | 3:00   | 2 - 1 - 1 |\n```\n   But the last one was a win.\n7. So we notice that in all of these cases, Muhsin Corbbrey wins by TKO against different opponents.\n\n8. Since only two rows were mentioned, but there are actually more than two rows where Muhsin Corbbrey wins by TKO against different opponents, the claim seems to be true for most of them, however, one row does not fit.\n   The actual dates do not match those given in the problem statement.\n\n9. Given that we only have information about the date range 2006-09-15 and there is another row from a different date where Muhsin Corbbrey wins by TKO:\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2009 - 02 - 28 | win      | troy nelson       | shoreline ball room      | hilton head , south carolina , usa    | decision             |       6 | 3:00   | 6 - 2 - 1 |\n```\n   And\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2005 - 11 - 26 | win      | ben lock          | show place arena         | upper marlboro , maryland , usa       | decision (unanimous) |       4 | 3:00   | 1 - 1 - 1 |\n```\n   And\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2006 - 09 - 15 | win      | ryan rayonec       | omar shrine temple        | mount pleasant , south carolina , usa | tko                  |       4 | 0:54   | 5 - 2 - 1 |\n```\n   And\n   ```\n| date           | result   | opponent          | venue                    | location                              | method               |   round | time   | record    |\n| 2006 - 04-21 | win      | shelton barnes     | omar shrine temple        | mount pleasant , south carolina , usa | tko                  |       1 | 2:43   | 4-1-1    |\n```\n10. Therefore, we can conclude that there is at least one date where Muhsin Corbbrey wins by TKO.\n11. However, this doesn't mean the whole claim is true.\n\n12. The problem statement says \"The problem asks you to verify if all the dates mentioned in the claim fall within the actual dates of fights of Muhsin Corbbrey.\"\n   Since only one row has an actual date that does not match the given date, we can conclude that at least one date mentioned in the claim falls outside the actual dates of fights.\n\n13. Therefore, the claim is false for most cases.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Based on our findings, this is indeed true.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, one row has a location in Maryland but does not have a loss record.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if Muhsin Corbbrey never lost a fight in Maryland\nSince we could not find any rows with a result of \"loss\", it would seem that the claim should be true. But since there are fights without a loss record, it cannot definitively mean he never lost.\n\nHowever looking closer, no loss is recorded and the relevant cells for this query are:\n```markdown\n| row_index | column_name    |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| 5         | location       |\n| 4         | result         |\n```\n\n### Step 6: Determine if there's any evidence that contradicts the claim\nOne relevant entry in Maryland does not have a loss, however another location has a win or draw.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim: \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against ben lock in 2006\".\n   The claim claims Tim Coleman has never lost to Ben Lock in 2006.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out if there are any fights between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock that took place in 2006.\n   We will look at the table row by row for this information.\n\n3. In the given table, \n   - In the row corresponding to \"2006-06-15\", Tim Coleman is shown to have lost against \"Tim ColemaN\" (note: the name seems to be misspelled in the table, but we will assume it refers to 'Tim Coleman') with a unanimous decision. The opponent is stated as 'tim coleman' which likely means Tim Coleman.\n   - However, this row also states that Tim Coleman won against another opponent named \"Shelton Barnes\" in the same year.\n   - In order to verify if Tim Coleman lost to Ben Lock we need to look for any other relevant rows.\n\n4. In the given table, \n   - There is no other row mentioned which mentions a fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock that resulted in a loss for either of them.\n\n5. Therefore, as per the information provided in the table, we can't find any evidence of a 2006 fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock where Tim Coleman lost.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of the given data in the table, we can conclude that there is no record of Tim Coleman losing to Ben Lock in 2006.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

To verify the claim, we need to search for Muhsin Corbbrey's fight records within this time frame and round duration.\n3. Looking at the table, there is no clear record of Muhsin Corbbrey participating in a 4-fight sequence between 2006 and 2009. However, his performance data is sparse throughout the table.\n4. We need to check if any of these fights lasted more than 5 rounds.\n5. Upon reviewing each fight individually within this time frame, we find that Muhsin Corbbrey fought in a number of events but none of them have the exact criteria mentioned on the claim (specifically 4-fight sequence and more than 5 rounds). \n6. However, we can verify if any of these fights exceeded 5 rounds.\n\n#### Verifying Round Duration:\n- Looking at each Muhsin Corbbrey fight within the given timeframe: \n  - He had a loss against Emanuel Gonzalez in 2005 (4th round, but exact time not specified) which lasted less than 5 rounds.\n  - He also had an earlier draw against Ricardo Planter in 2005 (4th round, but exact time not specified), which was within the timeframe of interest.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nThe relevant cells for this chain are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"time\"},\n]\n```\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that the claim is **FALSE** because there's no evidence of Muhsin Corbbrey fighting in a 4-fight sequence between 2006 and 2009 or any fight lasting more than 5 rounds within this timeframe.",
