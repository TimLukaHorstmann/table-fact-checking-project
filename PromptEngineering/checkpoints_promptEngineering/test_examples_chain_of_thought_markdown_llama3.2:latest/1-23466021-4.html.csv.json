Look up the attendance and final score for the Lions in week 8\n   - This shows that they played at Skydome with a score of w 34 - 25.\n\n3. Determine if these two results are consistent.\n   - If we look at the column \"record\" after week 4, we see that it is 3-1. \n   - However, since the Lions only played on August 1 (at BC Place Stadium) and lost to the Rough Riders with a final score of w 35 - 18 and also in Week 8 they won against lions, not losing.\n\nTherefore, based on these observations, we conclude that the claim is FALSE",

First, we need to find the attendance information for October 20th.\n   Looking at the table, we see that on September 20th (10 games played), the team was 11-5. However, since this does not help us directly in determining which team lost the game, we proceed with checking every column under row 15.\n\n2. Now, looking at column 'final score' for October 20th.\n   It shows that the Stampeders won the game 34 - 27 against the Tiger-Cats.\n\n3. Since this is not a loss, let us move to the next column and see if there are any losses on october 20th for the tiger-cats.\n   Looking at column 'record' we can find the team that lost on October 20th by finding the row with \"10 - 5\" in the first cell of that row which is not the relevant information here. The loss actually corresponds to another date, therefore the relevant information must be found under 'final score'.\n\n4. Looking at column 'final score' we can find the Tiger-Cats record as a tie because the final score has an (ot) after it indicating overtime.\n   So now that we know this team lost on october 20th, let us see what column we need to check for our answer.\n\n5. Now we move to column 'date', which will be used to determine if October 20th was a win or loss for the Tiger-Cats. \n   We can see that the date of row 15 is indeed october 20th.\n\n6. Based on this information, we are able to conclude that the tiger-cats actually lost the game 34 - 39 on october 20th.\n   So now that we know both parts of our answer (the team and the final score), let us see what relevant cells in the table these correspond to.\n\n7. The 'final score' column corresponds to cell number [15,6] because row 15 and column 6 is \"34 - 27\".\n8.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the opponent and location for game #4\nFirst, we need to find the information about the Rough Riders (the opponents) on August 1st.\nWe can see that in row #4, the \"opponent\" column shows \"lions\". We also observe that the \"location\" is indeed listed as \"bc place stadium\".\n\n### Step 2: Identify the final score and attendance for game #4\nNext, we verify that the final score was indeed 52-41 (OT) and check if the attendance matches.\nThe attendance for August 1st is listed in row #4 as 53527.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the win/loss record after game #4\nWe confirm that the Rough Riders' record on August 1st should be \"3 - 1\" since they lost to the lions with an overtime loss.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"final score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}$.",
