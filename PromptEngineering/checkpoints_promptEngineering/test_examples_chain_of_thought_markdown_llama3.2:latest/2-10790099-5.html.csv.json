First, I need to find the crowd sizes for each venue from the table.\n   The relevant cells are: \n   * 14000 (row_index = 0, column_name = \"crowd\")\n   * 13000 (row_index = 1, column_name = \"crowd\")\n   * 32000 (row_index = 2, column_name = \"crowd\")\n   * 12000 (row_index = 3, column_name = \"crowd\")\n   * 10000 (row_index = 4, column_name = \"crowd\")\n   * 28000 (row_index = 5, column_name = \"crowd\")\n\n2. Next, I need to determine which crowd size is the second largest.\n   After examining the list of crowds, I see that the smallest crowd size is 10000 and the largest is 32000. The second largest crowd size would be the one in between these two.\n\n3. Since there are multiple venues with the same crowd size (28000), we cannot assume it's the second largest crowd solely based on this data.\n   We have to look for another venue that has a lower crowd size than 32000 but higher than 10000, otherwise, we can't identify which is the \"second\" largest.\n\n4. After examining the list of crowds again, I notice that the smallest of these three (28000) actually corresponds with Lake Oval.\n   Now it's clear: since Lake Oval had a crowd size lower than the largest and higher than the second most populous venue, the claim can be verified by determining if there is another venue that has more people.\n\n5. Comparing all venues, I see that Richmond only has 10000 attendees on its match day.\n   Therefore, we've confirmed Lake Oval indeed was the site for the second largest crowd based on our observations.\n\n6.
