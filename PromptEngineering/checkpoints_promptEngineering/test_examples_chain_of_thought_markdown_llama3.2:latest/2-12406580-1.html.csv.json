    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of grand slam tournaments attended by Uhlirova between 2006 and 2012.\n   Looking at the table, we see that there are a total of 7 grand slam tournaments between 2006 and 2012 (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open).\n\n2. Next, we need to check which ones were attended by Uhlirova:\n   - 2008: 4-4\n   - 2009: 1-4\n   - 2010: 2-4\n   - 2011: 6-4\n   - 2012: 5-4\n\n3. Now we sum up the number of grand slam tournaments attended by Uhlirova:\n   4 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 5 = 18\n\n4. Next, we need to check how many were missed (only if that information is required or if it could change our answer) but since we know there are 7, and we just added up all the wins so we don't need to know any losses to find out if uhlirova attend all but 4\n5. Since Uhlirova attended a total of 18 grand slam tournaments between 2006 and 2012, this is higher than the number stated in the claim (which was \"all but 4\").
