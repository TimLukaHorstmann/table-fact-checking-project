To do this, we can convert each fraction into a single number by considering the whole part and the denominator.\n\n```markdown\n- For 4/11, the whole part is 4.\n- For 1/3, the whole part is 1.\n- For 2/4, the whole part is 2.\n- For 2/3, the whole part is 2.\n- For 1/6, the whole part is 1.\n- For 3/6, the whole part is 0 (or -1 if you consider negative numbers).\n- For 5/7, the whole part is 5.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare and determine\nWe now compare all these values to find the lowest one.\n\n```markdown\nThe smallest value for final position among all years is -1 which corresponds to a final position of \"3 / 6\". \nBut we should look at the row with index 8, where the relevant column is \"final_position\" and it has \"3/6\".\n```\n### Step 4: Determine if claim is TRUE or FALSE\nSince the lowest final position among all years was found to be \"3/6\", which corresponds to the 2008 hurricane season result. We can conclude that this value is less than the value for the 2009 year, which has a final position of \"5 / 7\".
