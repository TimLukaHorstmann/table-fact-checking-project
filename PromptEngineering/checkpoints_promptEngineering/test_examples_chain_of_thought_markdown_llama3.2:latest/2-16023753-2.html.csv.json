Analyze rows with scores matching the given value:\n   - The Dolphins are not present, but we look at other teams.\n   - New England Patriots have a score of 24 in one of their games (row 11).\n   - New York Jets also have a score of 34 points in another game (rows 7 and 16).\n   - New Orleans Saints scored 17 points against the Dolphins, but no team we are looking for has a score of 34.\n\n5.
