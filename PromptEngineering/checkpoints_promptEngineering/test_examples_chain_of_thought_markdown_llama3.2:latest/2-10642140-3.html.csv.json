We will compare this value with other countries' silver medal counts to see if any other country has more.\n\nStep 3: Check for other countries with a higher number of silver medals\nWe can see that Tunisia is not alone in having 6 silver medals. Several other countries also have 6 or fewer silver medals. For example, Senegal and South Africa both have only 2-3 silver medals, which is less than Tunisia's.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the ranking to determine if Tunisia wins the most silver\nSince there are multiple countries with the same number of silver medals (i.e., Tunisia, Senegal, South Africa), we need to check their total medal counts. The country with the highest total medal count will be declared as the winner.\n\nStep 5: Compare Tunisia's total medal count with other countries' total medal counts\nTunisia has a total of 16 gold + 6 silver = 22 medals (as shown in row 2 of the table).
