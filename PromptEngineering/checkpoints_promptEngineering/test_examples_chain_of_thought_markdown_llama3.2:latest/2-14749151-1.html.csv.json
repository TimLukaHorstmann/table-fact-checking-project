We can see that the \"position in 2003\" column is listed for all teams, so we will look up both \"Neman\" and \"Belshina\" to find their respective positions.\n\n### Finding Positions:\n\n- For \"Neman\", its position in 2003 is listed as 7.\n- For \"Belshina\", its position in 2003 is listed as 10.\n\n4. Now, we compare the positions of \"Neman\" and \"Belshina\".

We can do this by looking at the table and finding rows where the \"venue\" column matches \"atlant\".\n\n2. Next, we need to count how many teams have this venue. From the given information in step 1, naftan has the venue \"atlant\", so there is only one team with a venue called \"atlant\". However, since the claim states that mtz - ripo be 1 of 2 team with venue atlant, we need to check if other teams also have this venue.\n\n3. Now, let's verify the claim by finding out which teams are indeed among those that share the same venue as mtz - ripo (i.e., 'atlant'). This means checking the row where \"mtz - ripo\" is listed in order to determine its corresponding venue and then seeing if any other team shares it. If only one other team has this venue, the claim will be true; otherwise, the claim will be false.\n\n4. Upon closer inspection of the given table, we see that naftan indeed shares the same venue (\"atlant\") as mtz - ripo, but there is no information in the question to say whether 'atlant' belongs to 2 teams.
