To verify the claim, we need to compare the crowd sizes of two games played by Richmond versus Carlton on August 16, 1975: one at the MCG (Richmond) with a crowd size of 49756, and another at VFL Park (Footscray) with Hawthorn, which is not relevant for this claim, and then look at the relevant match between geelong vs south melbourne.\n\n2. The second game is: Richmond versus Carlton.\n3. We need to check if the largest crowd was present during this specific match, since it states that the largest crowd belongs to \"the game play by richmond versus carlton\". So we should focus only on the relevant information of the MCG and VFL Park.\n\n4. Looking at table row 6: Richmond scored 98 points and Carlton scored 95 points with a crowd size of 49756, whereas in another match the largest crowd was 28359, belonging to match st kilda vs collingwood.\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the scores for both the home team and the away team at Moorabbin Oval.\n   - For the home team (st kilda), the score was 20.17 (137).\n   - For the away team (collingwood), the score was 24.12 (156).\n\n2. Next, we need to check if both teams scored their highest at the same game played at Moorabbin Oval.\n   - Since there is only one game played at Moorabbin Oval in the table and st kilda scored its highest (137) while collingwood did not score its highest (156) at this venue.\n\n3. Now, let's check if both teams scored their highest at Moorabbin Oval.\n   - The answer to this is no because st kilda scored its highest while Collingwood did not, and no other team besides St Kilda has the higher score than it and away from Moorabbin oval.\n\n\n4. We also need to check if there are any other matches where a different home team or away team scored their highest at the same venue.\n   - There is one more game with Essendon (105) which happened in Windy Hill but then we found another match of Essendon with 15.15 being lowest when against North Melbourne, while Collingwood was above that.\n\n\n5. Since there are no other matches where both teams scored their highest at the same venue and at Moorabbin Oval is confirmed as not happening here, we can confidently say our initial assumption about st kilda game is correct.\n\n6. There isn't a single game played by Essendon, Fitzroy or Richmond that could be considered in order to break this conclusion, although they are all home teams.\n\n\n7. Therefore, there must exist some other possible venues where both teams may have scored highest and thus for the claim about Moorabbin oval we can conclude it's not true.\n\n\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the crowd for the game at VFL Park and the crowd for the game at MCG from the table.\n   - For the game at VFL Park: The relevant row is `footscray` with a crowd of 15601.\n   - For the game at MCG: The relevant row is `richmond` with a crowd of 49756.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the difference between these two crowds to verify if it equals 14155.\n   - Difference = Crowd at MCG - Crowd at VFL Park\n   - Difference = 49756 - 15601\n\n3. Perform the subtraction: \n   - Difference = 34155\n\n4. Compare this result with 14155:\n   - If the difference is equal to 14155, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - If the difference is not equal to 14155, then the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify crowd values for VFL Park and MCg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate difference in crowds\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Compare result with the given value (14155)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
