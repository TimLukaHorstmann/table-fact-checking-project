Evaluate if the claim is true for each match:\n- For Carlton, we see they scored 14.9 (93), which is less than the highest score found.\n- For Melbourne, we see they scored 12.16 (88), which is lower than 14.9 (93).\n- For Richmond, we see they scored 10.14 (74), which is also lower than 14.9 (93).\n- For Hawthorn, we see they scored 14.12 (96), which is higher than 14.9 (93).\n- For Essendon, we see they scored 7.9 (51), which is lower than 14.9 (93).\n\n4.
