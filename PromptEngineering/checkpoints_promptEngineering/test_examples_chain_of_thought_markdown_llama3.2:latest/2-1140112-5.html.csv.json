    "claim": "the caen circuit be commonly use as the aintree circuit in the 1956 formula one season",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the columns that provide information about both the Caen circuit and Aintree circuit.\n   The relevant column for the Caen circuit is \"report\" with the row index corresponding to row 4 (iv grand prix de caen). \n   The relevant column for Aintree circuit is \"circuit\" with the value \"aintree\".\n\n2. Next, we need to identify the date information that corresponds to both Caen and Aintree circuits in the same season.\n   Since the claim specifically mentions the 1956 formula one season, we will filter our search to this year.\n\n3. We then compare the \"date\" column values for both circuits during the 1956 season. \n   The relevant row index corresponding to the Caen circuit dates back to row 4 (iv grand prix de caen), while Aintree is found in rows 12 and 16. \n\n4. Now, we need to determine if there is any overlap of the date values for both circuits during this particular season.\n   Since there are two different date entries for the Aintree circuit in the provided data, whereas Caen's entry only appears on one row (26 august), we will proceed with caution.\n\n5. After checking all relevant information, we determine that the claim cannot be confirmed to be true based solely on the given table.\n\n6. With this conclusion, our answer can now be generated.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the columns that provide information about both the Caen circuit and Aintree circuit.\",\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the date information that corresponds to both Caen and Aintree circuits in the same season.\",\n      \"row_index\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the date column values for both circuits during the 1956 season.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if there is any overlap of the date values for both circuits during this particular season.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"report\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",
