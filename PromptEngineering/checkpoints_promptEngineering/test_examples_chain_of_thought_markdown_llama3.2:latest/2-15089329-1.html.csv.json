    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's identify which rows in the table are primary schools.\n   - These are the rows where the type column is equal to 'primary'.\n\n2. Next, we'll check each of these primary school's ofsted number and see if it's greater than 117107.\n\n3. We can do this by looking at the values in the relevant columns for each row that matches our criteria.\n   - For example, for the first row ('belswains'), we would look at the 'ofsted number' column (the fifth column) to see if its value is greater than 117107.\n\n4. Now let's perform this check on all rows:\n\n- chambersbury: ofsted number = 117214\n- hobbs hill wood: ofsted number = 117368\n- leverstock green: ofsted number = 117416\n- lime walk: ofsted number = 117333\n- nash mills: ofsted number = 117418\n- reddings: ofsted number = 117234\n- st albert the great: ofsted number = 117471\n- tudor: ofsted number = 117109\n- two waters: ofsted number = 117108\n\n5. Now let's determine whether all primary school have ofsted number greater than 117107:\n   - We can see that not all of them do (e.g. chambersbury has an ofsted number less than 117107).\n   \n6.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that only one school is not listed as a primary type school, but it is listed as a special type school.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to identify schools that are not classified as primary but are listed under \"special\".\n3. Looking at the table, there's one row where \"type\" is not specified as either \"primary\" or \"ce\" (comprehensive education), which suggests it could be a non-primary type. That row is for \"woodfield\", with \"special\" being its school type.\n4. However, since the claim specifically mentions that this school must also have \"not list as primary,\" we can't simply count Woodfield without considering what \"ce\" means. In some cases, \"ce\" stands for comprehensive education or special needs but in the table here it's not explicitly stated to stand for anything other than special type.\n5. We'll verify that \"woodfield\" is indeed listed under only one category with its claim - being a non primary and special type school\n6. If we were to list all schools which are categorized as something other then \"primary\", the list would include:\n-   \"two waters\"\n-   \"reddings\"\n-   \"st albert the great\" because it's an RC (Roman Catholic) school.\n7. As per our claim, there can be only one of these 3. Since two Waters and st albert are categorized as primary type schools we don't need to count them. Hence, we're left with one school which does not fit into the \"Primary\" category but is also listed as a Special type.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, we need to understand the claim that needs to be evaluated.\n   The claim states that Leverstock Green is the only school that is CE affiliated.\n\n2. Next, let's examine the table provided.\n   To determine if Leverstock Green is indeed the only CE affiliated school, we must check each row of the \"faith\" column for schools with a value of \"ce\".\n\n3.

For Leverstock Green (which we know is at row 5), its faith entry should be 'ce' if it's true that Leverstock Green is CE affiliated.\n\n5. After verifying Leverstock Green's faith, we'll look at every other row and check if their faith entry also equals \"ce\" to see if any others match the criteria for being CE affiliated schools like Leverstock Green.\n\n6. If only one school in the table has a faith value of 'ce' which is Leverstock Green (row 5), then our claim holds true.\n   Otherwise, Leverstock Green isn't the only CE affiliated school and our claim is false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued...\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Claim states that Leverstock Green be the only school that be ce affiliated\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Examine table for schools with faith entry of 'ce'\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Verify Leverstock Green's faith entry equals 'ce' in row 5\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\n                    \"row_index\": 4,\n                    \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Check every other school with faith value of 'ce' to ensure Leverstock Green is the only CE affiliated school\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\n                    \"row_index\": 0,\n                    \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"row_index\": 1,\n                    \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 5,\n            \"description\": \"Leverstock Green isn't the only CE affiliated school if at least one other row has faith entry of 'ce'\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [\n                {\n                    \"row_index\": 1,\n                    \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"row_index\": 6,\n                    \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 6,\n            \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Claim states that Leverstock Green be the only school that be ce affiliated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Examine table for schools with faith entry of 'ce'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Verify Leverstock Green's faith entry equals 'ce' in row 5\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check every other school with faith value of 'ce' to ensure Leverstock Green is the only CE affiliated school\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Leverstock Green isn't the only CE affiliated school if at least one other row has faith entry of 'ce'\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the type of claim**: The claim states \"more than 8 primary school in Dacorum be affiliate with church\". This implies we need to count the number of primary schools that are affiliated with a church.\n\n2. **Determine the definition of \"affiliated with church\"**: Since some rows in the table have \"ce\" (indicating Church of England) and others have \"-\" (indicating no affiliation), we need to identify which schools are explicitly affiliated with a church.\n\n3. **Count the number of primary schools with \"ce\" affiliation**: We can see that there are 3 rows with \"ce\" in their \"faith\" column: leverstock green, nash mills, and st albert the great. These schools are affiliated with a church.\n\n4. **Consider if other affiliations (like \"rc\") count towards the claim**: The table shows that st albert the great is also affiliated with a church (Roman Catholic), but this does not meet the condition of being affiliated with a Church of England school as implied by the claim.\n\n5. **Check for any primary schools without church affiliation**: There are 4 rows in the \"faith\" column without any explicit indication of church affiliation: belswains, chambersbury, hobbs hill wood, and reddings. However, we must consider if these schools meet the condition of being affiliated with a church.\n\n6. **Verify that only primary schools should be counted**: The claim explicitly states \"primary school\", so we need to exclude any schools classified as \"special\" (woodfield in this table).\n\n7. **Evaluate if there are more than 8 primary schools meeting the conditions**: From steps 3-6, we know there are at least 2 primary schools affiliated with a Church of England and none explicitly affiliated with another church that meets the criteria. Therefore, it is unclear whether there are indeed more than 8 such schools.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"faith\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
