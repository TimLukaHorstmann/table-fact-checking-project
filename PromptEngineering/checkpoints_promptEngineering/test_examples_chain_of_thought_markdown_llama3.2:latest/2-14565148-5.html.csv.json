    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims there be a total of 6 Ohio Valley Conference from 1953 through 1979.\n2. Next, let's look at the table and find all rows where \"conference\" equals \"ohio valley\". These are the relevant rows for our evaluation:\n   | year   | conference   | overall record   | conference record   | coach             |\n   |--------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n   | 1953   | ohio valley  | 16 - 9           | 9 - 1               | paul s mcbrayer   |\n   | 1959   | ohio valley  | 16 - 6           | 10 - 2              | paul s mcbrayer   |\n   | 1961   | ohio valley  | 15 - 9           | 9 - 3               | paul s mcbrayer   |\n   | 1965   | ohio valley  | 19 - 6           | 13 - 1              | james e baechtold |\n   | 1972   | ohio valley  | 15 - 11          | 9 - 5               | guy r strong      |\n   | 1979   | ohio valley  | 21 - 8           | 9 - 3               | ed byhre          |\n\n3. Now, let's check how many of these rows exist. There are six (6) of them.\n\n4. Next, we need to verify the claim that there be a total of 6 ohio valley conference from 1953 through 1979.

To do this, let's find the coach's name for 1964 since it is the only missing year in the claim.\n\n```markdown\n| year   | conference   | overall record   | conference record   | coach             |\n|:-------|:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------------|:------------------|\n| total  | total        | 6                | 6                   | 6                 |\n```\n\nThe table shows that there is no entry for a coach in the \"coach\" column under the row corresponding to the year 1964. Since it's not mentioned as an Ohio Valley Conference year, we can infer this.\n\n3. Now, let's move on to verify if Paul S McBrayer was the coach at three Ohio Valley Conferences:\n- For the years 1953 and 1959, we see that the coach is indeed \"paul s mcbrayer\". So far, two checks are successful.\n- However, for year 1964, there is no entry under Paul S McBrayer, so this check fails.\n\n```markdown\n| year   | conference   | overall record   | conference record   | coach             |\n|:-------|:-------------|:-----------------|:--------------------|:------------------|\n| 1953   | ohio valley  | 16 - 9           | 9 - 1               | paul s mcbrayer   |\n| 1959   | ohio valley  | 16 - 6           | 10 - 2              | paul s mcbrayer   |\n| ...    |             |                   |                     |                   |\n```\n\n4.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about James E Baechtold is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Determine the number of coaches who have won the Ohio Valley Conference.\n   - First, look at the \"coach\" column. There are 6 different names listed: Paul S McBrayer, Guy R Strong, Ed Byhre, James E Baechtold, and two other unnamed coaches (their names not shown in this table). \n\n2. Check if there is any coach who has won more than one Ohio Valley Conference.\n   - The \"overall record\" column shows that Paul S McBrayer has a total of 21-8, indicating he won the conference multiple times.\n\n3. Since we know Paul S McBrayer has won more than once and it\u2019s not specified whether James E Baechtold or anyone else was coach in other years apart from 1965, check if there is any year where James E Baechtold wasn\u2019t the coach.\n   - In this case, there isn't any year that shows James E Baechtold as an assistant coach. Only in the year 1965.\n\n4. Since we have established Paul S McBrayer was one of the coaches for Ohio Valley Conference at least once and is also mentioned to be coach in multiple years so far, it means James E Baechtold is indeed one of the two coaches for 1 Ohio Valley Conference, in 1965.\n\n5.

To verify this, we need to find the coach of the team with the most recent year in the table.\n3. Looking at the \"year\" column, we see that 1979 is the most recent year mentioned in the table.\n4. We then look for the coach associated with the 1979 Ohio Valley conference record.\n5. According to the table, the coach of the 1979 Ohio Valley team was Ed Byhre.\n6.
