    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the objective**: We need to determine whether the claim about the highest series of the season occurring until May is true or false.\n\n2. **Locate relevant information**:\n   - The table shows various games, scores, and their respective dates.\n   - The \"series\" column keeps track of the overall score between two teams in a particular game.\n   - We will analyze each row to determine if any series occurred before May 1st.\n\n3. **Analyze Row 5**: \n   - Game number 5 took place on April 29th.\n   - The final score is 81-98, which means the first team lost.\n   - The \"series\" column indicates that the overall lead at this point was 2 games (2-3) in favor of the losing team.\n\n4. **Analyze Row 6**: \n   - Game number 6 took place on May 1st.\n   - The final score is 77-100, which means the first team lost again.\n   - The \"series\" column indicates that at this point, it was already game 5 in the overall series (2-4), meaning the losing team won two games before May.\n\n5. **Determine the answer based on relevant information**:\n   Since there is a mention of games occurring after April 20th with series numbers higher than what would occur until May and because one of those games occurred right at or very close to May, it suggests that high-numbered series may indeed start before May for this particular set of games.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells**:\n   - We can identify the following cells as relevant based on our analysis: \n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 5,\n       \"column_name\": \"series\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"series\"\n     }\n     ```",
