Thus, no actual tie.\n  - Belasica has a tie: The score is written as \"7-1\" but then indicates a 6-0 and a 1-1 draw; this might suggest a tie, but given the context of \"first leg\" and \"second leg\", it seems to describe wins for Belasica.\n  - Karaorman has a tie: (4-4), indicating a draw.\n  - Vardar has a tie: The score is written as \"7-1\" but indicates a win with specific scores; however, upon closer inspection, there's no explicit mention of a tie in the aggregate for Vardar either. Thus, it seems to be describing wins for Vardar without mentioning a draw.\n  - Alumina and Cementarnica clearly show no ties since their 'agg' scores describe clear wins.\n\n- **Count Ties**: From our analysis:\n  - Only two teams have \"ties\" in aggregate: Sloga jugomagnat and Pelister. This is because the others either describe clear wins (Vardar, Belasica) or have a draw but are not explicitly called out as such.\n\n- **Conclusion**: There are only 2 instances of ties in aggregate scores across all rows examined, which does not meet the criteria of having exactly three teams with this condition.\n\n### Final JSON Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    }\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 1\"\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}",

Since the claim is about the existence of exactly two teams with a tie aggregate score, I need to count how many such teams there are.\n5. If I find more than one team with a tie aggregate score, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n6. In order to confirm if any of these teams have a tie aggregate score in 2000-2019 Macedonian football season, I will use the information about the match that includes (a) notation - this will help me determine which games were not played as planned or decided with penalty shootout.\n\n\nAfter my reasoning process, here is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"I need to identify the teams that have a tie aggregate score in the 2000-2019 Macedonian football season.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"I will examine each team's aggregate score in the table provided to determine which teams have a tie aggregate score.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"The aggregate scores are listed as \\\"agg\\\" in the table, and they are shown for both the 1st leg and 2nd leg of each match.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"Since the claim is about the existence of exactly two teams with a tie aggregate score, I need to count how many such teams there are.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"If I find more than one team with a tie aggregate score, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"In order to confirm if any of these teams have a tie aggregate score in 2000-2019 Macedonian football season, I will use the information about the match that includes (a) notation - this will help me determine which games were not played as planned or decided with penalty shootout.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We must instead identify those matches with scores in the first column equal to \"20 - 1\" to determine that this score was achieved only by a single game and calculate the total.\n\nStep 5: Identify any match where \"1st leg\" equals 20-1\nWe are looking for a row where the value is exactly 20-1. Let's look at each match in turn:\nThe first row shows 2 - 0 which doesn't meet the requirement of being 20 - 1.\nHowever, we must continue checking all rows to see if any match has an aggregate score equal to 21.\n\nStep 6: Look for a total of 21\nWe can look at all matches and sum up their first leg scores.
