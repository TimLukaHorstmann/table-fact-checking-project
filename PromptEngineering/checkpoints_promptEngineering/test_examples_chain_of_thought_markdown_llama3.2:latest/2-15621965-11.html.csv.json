We also notice that both Tyronn Lues have \"nebraska\" listed as their school/team affiliation.\n4. Given this information, we can conclude that the claim is accurate, as there are indeed two players from Nebraska: Tyronn Lue (with years in Orlando 2003 - 2004) and Tyronn Lue (with years in Orlando 2009).\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We are interested in checking if the claim about the player Todd Lichti when he was in Orlando from 1993-1994 is true.\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there are two entries for Tyronn Lue and Todd Lichti: one from 2009 and another from 1993-1994. We need to focus on the entry with the year range 1993-1994 for Todd Lichti.\n3. In this specific row of the table, we see that the player is indeed Todd Lichti and the position is guard-forward.\n4. However, we also notice that there's another player, Tyronn Lue, who was in Orlando from 2009 with the same position (guard). This might seem confusing at first but it doesn't affect our claim about Todd Lichti.\n5. Now, let's confirm if Todd Lichti is indeed the player for this specific year range: We see that \"school / club team\" shows Stanford and Todd Lichti as the player, so we can be confident in our initial observation.\n6. Since both conditions are met (player Todd Lichti and position guard-forward when years in orlando are 1993-1994), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\" }\n  ]\n}",

Next, we need to confirm that he played for the Orlando Magic from 2007 - 2010.\n5. According to the table, Rashard Lewis played for the Orlando Magic from 1997 - 1998 (in row 1) and again from 2007 - 2010 (which is the same time frame as in the claim). However, we cannot confirm that there are no other gaps or overlaps.\n6. Finally, we need to check if Rashard Lewis played for any other team during this time period. According to the table, Rashard Lewis also played for Alief Elsik HS before joining the Orlando Magic (from 2007-2010).\n7.
