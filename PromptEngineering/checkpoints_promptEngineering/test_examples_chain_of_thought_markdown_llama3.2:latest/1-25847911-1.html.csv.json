    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that \"trust yourself! your mark will surely improve and friendship or entrance final decision have the same rating percent\". This means we need to check if ep9 has a higher rating than any other row where the column 'translation of title' is either \"friendship\" or \"entrance exam\".\n\n2. In step 1, looking at the table, \"trust yourself! your mark will surely improve\" in ep9 column has a value of 14.5%. Now we need to check if there are any rows where the translation is \"friendship\" or \"entrance final decision\" that have a rating lower than 14.5%.\n\n3. In step 2, looking at the table again, we see that there are several instances with 'translation of title' as \"friendship\" or \"entrance exam\". Now let's check their ratings to determine if any of them are lower than ep9.\n\n4. Looking at the table row by row:\n- For 'friendship', the first instance in row 10 has a rating of 14.5%, which is equal to ep9, and no other rows below it have higher ratings.\n- In the second instance for 'friendship' in row 11, there's no data provided, hence we can't verify its claim.\n- For \"entrance final decision\", only one row exists with a rating of 14.5%.\n\n5. Now that we've checked all instances, since at least two different translations have the same lower rating (friendship and entrance exam), we must determine whether it has the same or not.\n\n6. Because both have a rating lower than ep9's, but they don't necessarily share the exact same rating value, let alone be in ep9, we can safely conclude that the claim is false.\n\n7. Lastly, to identify which row contains the specific words \"friendship\" and \"entrance final decision\", we find that it's rows 10 and 11.
