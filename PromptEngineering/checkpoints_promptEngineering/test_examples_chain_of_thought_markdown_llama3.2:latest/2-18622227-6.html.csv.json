    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, let's examine the relevant cells for the US Open tournament:\n   - In 1986: US Open (1986) = 1r\n   - In 1999: US Open (1999) = 1r\n\n2. Next, we can see that in both cases, the US Open has had a \"1r\" result.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the relevant cells for the Australian Open tournament:\n   - In 1986: Australian Open (1986) = a\n   - In 1999: Australian Open (1999) = a\n\n4. However, there is no information about the Australian Open in 1988 or any other year that would affect the claim.\n\n5. Now let's look at the relevant cells for the French Open tournament:\n   - In 1986: French Open (1986) = a\n   - In 1999: French Open (1999) = 1r\n\n6. There is no information about the French Open in 1988 or any other year that would affect the claim.\n\n7. Finally, let's look at the relevant cells for the Wimbledon tournament:\n   - In 1986: Wimbledon (1986) = a\n   - In 1999: Wimbledon (1999) = a\n\n8. There is no information about the Wimbledon in 1988 or any other year that would affect the claim.\n\nSince we verified that the US Open had \"1r\" in both years, but there's no information to contradict this result for Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon tournaments, the only possible reason the statement may be FALSE is if there are more matches than what is given here. However, based on our analysis of just the provided rows, we cannot deny that the claim is false.\n\n9. Based on our step-by-step verification, our reasoning leads to a final conclusion:\n\n\"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: We need to determine if there were 1r in both years for US Open\",\n    \"Step 2: Then we will look at Australian open\"\n],\n\"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"US Open\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Australian Open\"}\n]",

To determine if the claim about Wimbledon having the same result in 1986 and 1999 is true, we need to check the values in the table for these two years.\n2. First, let's look at the row for 1986: | tournament | 1986 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n3.

Next, let's look at the row for 1999: | tournament | 1999 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...\n5.
