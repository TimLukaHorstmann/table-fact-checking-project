First, we need to identify the relevant information for the claim about Donington Park being the venue for 1996 and 1997.\n   - We will look at the row index and column name of the cell that contains the venue for each year in question.\n\n2. For the claim to be true, both Donington Park must be listed as the venue for 1996 and 1997 in their respective rows.\n\n3. Let's examine each relevant row:\n   - Row 1: The season is 1990, not 1996 or 1997.\n   - Row 2: The season is 1991, not 1996 or 1997.\n   - Row 5: The season is 1994, not 1996 or 1997.\n   - Row 6: This row contains information about the year 1996 and its venue as \"donington park\".\n   - Row 7: This row contains information about the year 1997 and its venue as \"donington park\".\n\n4.

For example, for 1990, it's Pedro Lamy and Diogo Castro Santos as drivers of Portugal; they don't appear in the Austrian team list.\n\n3. **Analyze data**:\n   - From row_index = 3 (season 1993), we see Austria is listed under \"teams\" but not as a champion.\n   - Also from row_index = 3, Diogo Castro Santos appears under champions as Portuguese driver but does not appear in Austrian team list for this season.\n\n4. **Verify claim against data**:\n   - Since there's no record of an Austrian team or driver winning the championship and Austria is listed as a separate entry with different drivers without being part of Portugal's champion team during 1990-1998, it appears that Austria has not won the championship more than once in this timeframe.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The data confirms Austria has only appeared once under \"teams\" but never won the championship alone or as part of a champion team from 1990 to 1998, making the claim TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim: Austria have only win the championship 1 time from 1990 to 1998\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate relevant cells in the table for champion and teams/driver appearances of Austria.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Analyze data: Check Austrian team and driver appearances as well as championship wins.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Verify claim against data: Compare the analysis with available data to conclude on the truth of the statement.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion: The data supports Austria not having won more than one championship in this timeframe, so the claim is TRUE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"teams\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1990,\n      \"column_name\": \"drivers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"champion\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
