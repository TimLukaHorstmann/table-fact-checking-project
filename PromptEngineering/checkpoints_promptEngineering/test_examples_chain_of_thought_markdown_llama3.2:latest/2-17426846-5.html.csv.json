    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, we need to identify the rows where the transfer window is during the summer of 2008 - 2009.\n2. We can see from the table that the summer transfer windows are marked as \"summer\" in the \"transfer window\" column.\n3. Next, we need to count how many such rows exist.\n4. After counting, if there are more than 5 such rows, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n5. To verify this count, we can review each row where the transfer window is marked as \"summer\".\n\n### Relevant Rows and Transfers\n\n- Row Index: 0, Column Name: moving to (transfer)\n  - The relevant cells are:\n    ```\n{ \n\"row_index\": 0,\n\"column_name\": \"moving to (transfer)\"\n}\n```\n\n- Row Index: 1, Column Name: transfer window\n  - The relevant cell is:\n    ```\n{\n\"row_index\": 1,\n\"column_name\": \"transfer window\"\n}\n```\n- ...and so on for all rows with \"summer\" in the transfer window column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Counting of Relevant Rows\n\nLet's count:\n\n* `Row Index: 0` = \"retirement\" (Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 1` = \"col\u00f3n\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 2` = \"v\u00edt\u00f3riadeset\u00fabal\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 3` = \"genk\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 4` = \"iraklis thessaloniki\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 5` = \"poli ejido\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 6` = \"anagennisi karditsa\" (Winter, Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 7` = \"rapid bucure\u0219ti\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 8` = \"benfica\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 9` = \"benfica\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 10` = \"al shabab\" (Winter, Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 11` = \"steauabucure\u0219ti\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 12` = \"skoda xanthi\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 13` = \"eintracht frankfurt\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 14` = \"anagennisi karditsa\" (Winter, Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 15` = \"apollon kalamaria\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 16` = \"genoa\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 17` = \"tigre\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 18` = \"iraklis thessaloniki\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 19` = \"mogi mirim\" (Winter, Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 20` = \"portsmouth\" (Winter, Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 21` = \"panetolikos\" (Winter, Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 22` = \"anorthosis famagusta\" (Winter, Not summer)\n* `Row Index: 23` = \"chievo\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 24` = \"eintracht frankfurt\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 25` = \"skoda xanthi\" (Summer)\n* `Row Index: 26` = \"anorthosis famagusta\" (Winter, Not summer)\n\nCount: 13\n\nSince there are more than 5 such rows with a transfer window during the summer of 2008 - 2009:\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Steps followed to check claim validity.
