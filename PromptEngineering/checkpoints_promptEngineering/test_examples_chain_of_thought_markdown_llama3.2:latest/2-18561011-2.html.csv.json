    "resp": "#### Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that \"the national stadium , in cardiff , wale , be the largest former rugby union stadium , close in 1997 , with a capacity of 53000 at the time of closure\". This means we need to check if the stadium in Cardiff, Wales is indeed the largest former rugby union stadium, was closed in 1997, and had a capacity of 53000 at the time of closure.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify relevant information\nFrom the table, we can see that:\n- The stadium in question is indeed called \"the national stadium\" and it's located in Cardiff.\n- The stadium was closed in 1997, which matches the claim.\n- The capacity of the stadium at the time of closure was 53000, which also matches the claim.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if it's a rugby union stadium\nWhile we can't see directly from the table whether the stadium is specifically used for rugby union or not, we should note that this information wasn't explicitly mentioned in our claim. We need to assume that it is.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify there isn't another larger former stadium\nWe must check if there's any other stadium listed as \"former\" and larger than the National Stadium in terms of capacity.\n\n- Looking at the table, we see several stadiums were closed before or with 'the national stadium'. In particular, Lansdowne Road had a higher (49000) capacity which is greater than 53000. Therefore, the claim that the National Stadium is the largest former rugby union stadium may be incorrect.\n\n#### Step 5: Compile evidence\nOur relevant data points are:\n- Row Index 1, Column Name: \"stadium\" = 'the national stadium'\n- Row Index 1, Column Name: \"capacity (at time of closure)\" = 53000\n- Row Index 1, Column Name: \"closed\" = 1997\n\n#### Step 6: Reach a conclusion\nWhile the claim about capacity and date is true for this particular stadium, it's not entirely accurate in stating that this stadium was the largest former rugby union stadium.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if claim is true\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify claim about largest stadium\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"closed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that the National Stadium in Cardiff, Wales is the smallest former rugby union stadium closed in 1997 with a capacity of 10887 at the time of closure.\n2. First, we need to verify if the National Stadium in Cardiff, Wales was indeed closed in 1997. According to the table, the National Stadium was closed in 1997, so this part is true.\n3. Next, we need to check if it was the smallest former rugby union stadium at that time. To do this, we need to find the capacities of all stadiums mentioned in the claim (excluding the National Stadium itself) and compare them with 10887. \n4. According to the table, we can see that there are several stadiums closed around or before 1997: lansdowne road (closed in 2007), petco park (closed in 2010), athletic park (closed in 1999), carisbrook (closed in 2011), stubhub center (closed in 2007) and loftus road (closed in 2001). All these stadiums were open before or after the National Stadium at some point, so they cannot be considered as smaller than the National Stadium.\n5. However, we need to consider that carisbrook was closed only one year later than the national stadium . So if carisbrook has a lower capacity it will not be greater.\n6. We can check the capacity of carisbrook (29000) and compare it with 10887, since 29000 is smaller than 10887 , then carisbrook is indeed smaller than the National Stadium in terms of capacity.\n\nNow we know that the National Stadium in Cardiff was closed in 1997, but this doesn't tell us if the stadium has the smallest capacity among rugby union stadiums closed around that time. However, since we've determined that the national stadium had a capacity greater than carisbrook, which also was rugby union stadium and smaller capacity at the time of closure , it implies that the claim is true.\n\n\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"} ,\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}",

This will help us understand why Edgeley Park and Firhill were chosen in the claim and how their closure relates to other stadiums closing in 2010.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze capacities of Edgeley Park and Firhill with those of other stadiums that closed in 2010.\n\nWe must compare the capacity at the time of closure for each relevant stadium. If both Edgeley Park and Firhill have lower capacities compared to other stadiums that closed in 2010, we can infer their status as \"the most recent large rugby union stadium to close.\"\n\n### Step 4: Determine if Edgeley Park and Firhill are indeed the most recent based on closure year.\n\nLastly, verify that they are among the most recent by comparing their closure years with those of other stadiums closing in 2010. If both have the same or later closure year than any other stadium in our subset, then we can confirm the claim.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Filter table for stadiums that closed in 2010.\",\n    \"Identify Edgeley Park and Firhill rows to understand their relation to claim.\",\n    \"Compare capacities of relevant stadiums closing in 2010 with those of Edgeley Park and Firhill.\",\n    \"Verify if both have the most recent closure year among those stadiums.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
