The relevant columns are:\n   - `proposed`\n   - `listed`\n\n2. **Count Projects Not Listed**: Count the number of projects that have not been listed.\n   Looking at the table, we can see that there is only one project that has not been listed: msd980601736.\n\n3. **Check if Unlisted Project Has Been Proposed**: Check if the unlisted project (msd980601736) was proposed before it was deleted.\n   According to the table, the construction for this project was completed on 12 / 30 / 1982, but cleanup was completed before formal creation of NPL. The proposal date is not explicitly stated in the \"proposed\" column but the completion date indicates that there was a formal process started (NPL) which was based off of prior work - the \"propose\" and \"construction completed dates are all related to each other.\n\n4. **Determine if Claim Holds**: Based on steps 2 and 3, determine if the claim holds true.\n   The only unlisted project in this dataset does indeed have a prior proposal (as indicated by the NPL creation date) - even though it is unclear whether a formal process was started before a \"proposed\" date, the data still implies that there was some level of planning initiated.\n\n5. **Check if Unlisted Project Has Been Proposed But Never Completed**: Check if the unlisted project was proposed but never completed.\n   Looking at the table again, we see that this project was proposed on 10 / 15 / 1984 and was later listed (at some point in 1986). Therefore, it is not a case of a project being proposed but never completed.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"proposed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"proposed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the projects proposed and listed during 1993\nTo determine if any project was both proposed and listed, but never completed, we need to find rows where `proposed` and `listed` are equal and their values indicate that construction was not completed.\n\n### Step 2: Determine construction completion status for identified rows\nFor each project identified in step 1, check the `construction completed` column. If a row indicates that the construction is still ongoing or has been partially deleted/deleted but does not state it as completed, we consider it incomplete.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze specific data points\n- Look at msd008154486 where proposed is on 06 / 23 / 1993 and listed is on 09 / 13 / 2001. The construction was completed on 09 / 17 / 1993, so this project is not in the category of being never complete.\n- Look at msd046497012 where proposed is on 05 / 11 / 2000 and listed is on 07 / 27 / 2000. The construction status for this row is missing, but since it does not state that it was completed or deleted before listing, we can't confirm its completion yet.\n- Look at msd980840045 where proposed is on 10 / 15 / 1984 and listed is on 06 / 10 / 1986. The construction status for this row is missing, but since it does not state that it was completed or deleted before listing, we can't confirm its completion yet.\n- Look at msd980601736 where proposed is on a date prior to formal creation of NPL and listed is on the same date as cleanup completed, indicating that construction's status could be different based on interpretation of 'cleanup completed'. However, this seems more like an initial construction phase than project completion.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if any row meets both conditions\nBased on steps 1-3, we see there are specific rows where data is missing or unclear. We can't definitively say none were proposed and listed but never completed because of incomplete information.\n\nHowever, for the sake of answering the question based on provided instructions, let's assume our logic about partially deleted/deleted but not stating it as completed might mislead us to a conclusion without explicit construction completion status in all relevant cases. Given this, our step-by-step process has identified ambiguity rather than clear-cut TRUE or FALSE.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven the lack of explicit information for some rows and focusing strictly on those with provided data, we cannot conclusively say that two projects were both proposed and listed but never completed based solely on available data without making assumptions about partially deleted/deleted status. However, given the instructions to provide a specific format answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"no matching row found\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"no matching row found\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"no matching row found\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that Potter Co. in Copiah is the first project proposed but the last to be listed.\n\n2. To verify this, we need to compare the \"proposed\" and \"listed\" columns for each project. If a project is listed before it was proposed, then the claim is FALSE. Otherwise, if the order matches or Potter Co. in Copiah is indeed the first one proposed and last one listed, then the claim is TRUE.\n\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that the \"proposed\" date for Potter Co. in Copiah is 05/10/1993, which comes before its \"listed\" date of - (indicating it was never listed).\n\n4.
