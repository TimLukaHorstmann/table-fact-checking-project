We need to check if the \"first leg\" of the semi-final is indeed in April 2011.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that there are multiple rows with the column name \"quarter-finals\". However, for our purpose, only one row matters:\n   - knockout phase | quarter - finals        | 18 march 2011             | 5 - 6 april 2011                        | 12 - 13 april 2011                      |\n4.

To verify this claim, we need to check if each of these rounds has a draw date listed as \"21 june 2010\".\n3. First, let's look at the quarter-finals. The draw date for the round of 16 (which is likely what the table actually refers to as the knockout phase round immediately following or before a team has been eliminated in the knockout phase) isn't specified by this claim, so we can exclude the knockout phase and focus only on the rounds after the \"qualifying\" phase since quarter finals are typically within the knockout phase. We look at the knockout phase and see that the draw date for round of 16 is 17 december 2010.\n4. Next, let's examine the semi-finals. The claim states that the semi-finals have a draw date on 21 june 2010, but the actual draw date for semi-finals appears to be in the knockout phase section of the table, specifically \"18 march 2011\".\n5. Finally, let's consider the finals. According to the claim, the final should also have a draw date on 21 june 2010. However, according to the table, the actual draw date for the final is indeed \"18 march 2011\".\n6.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the Claim\nThe claim states \"none of the leg of the quarter - final or semi- finals be in april 2011\". This means we need to check if any of the legs of the quarter-final or semi-final matches are scheduled for April 2011.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Relevant Matches\nWe need to find the rows in the table where \"round\" is either \"quarter - finals\" or \"semi - finals\", and then examine their corresponding dates, specifically looking for any leg (first or second) that fall into April 2011.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Quarter-Final Match Dates\nLooking at the row for \"quarter - finals\":\n- The draw date is listed as 18 March 2011.\n- For both legs of the quarter-final match, the dates are given in terms of month and day only (5-6 April 2011 and 12-13 April 2011), without explicitly stating the year. Given that this pattern holds true for all matches related to this phase, it is reasonable to infer that these dates are meant to represent specific days within the same month rather than months themselves.\n\n### Step 4: Examine Semi-Final Match Dates\nFor \"semi - finals\":\n- The draw date is again 18 March 2011.\n- The match leg dates (26-27 April 2011 and 3-4 May 2011) are clearly listed, with both being in the month of April.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion Based on Analysis\nGiven that at least one leg of the semi-final matches is indeed scheduled for April 2011, we can conclude that the claim \"none of the legs of the quarter - final or semi-finals be in april 2011\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identified the claim as 'none of the leg of the quarter - final or semi- finals be in april 2011'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Locate relevant matches for both quarter-finals and semi-finals.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Examine the dates of the quarter-final matches to verify if any are in April 2011.
