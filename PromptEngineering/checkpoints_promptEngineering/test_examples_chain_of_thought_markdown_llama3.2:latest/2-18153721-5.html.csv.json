    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the table structure to understand what a tie at 3rd place means. A player can be tied with another player at 3rd place if both players have the same score, i.e., they are even par.\n\n2. Next, we need to identify the scores of the players at the 3rd position (column 'score') that are even par ('to_par' column). \n\n    We can see that there is only one score for the 3rd position, which is 140 from all three players: tony johnstone, christy o'connor jnr, and d a weibring. This means they have even par, not a tie.\n\n   If there were multiple scores at 140 (i.e., more than one player), then those players could potentially be tied with each other, since their scores are equal and thus represent the same \"even to par\" value.\n\n3. Now let's look for any of these individual players also being in the list of 'place' column as a 2nd place or higher (i.e., they are not alone). If there is a second player with the exact same score in this table that can be found in either a '2nd place', '1st place', '4th place', etc., then it means these two players cannot be tied because each of them has to have one better score than another.\n\n   However, we see in our list that there is no other player who also has the exact same score. In other words, each of these three 3rd-place finishers have a unique set of 'score' and therefore they can only potentially tie with each other (but for now not yet being confirmed as ties).\n\n4. Now we need to check if these players ('tony johnstone', 'christy o'connor jnr', and 'd a weibring') appear in any list at 2nd place or better. We see that the first one, tony johnstone, appears at '3rd place'. But we also see that 'sandy lyle' appears at '1st place'.\n\n    This means Sandy lyle (1st) has a higher score than Tony Johnstone (3rd). Thus Sandy and Tony Johnstone are not tied.\n\n5. Next we check if the second player, christy o'connor jnr ('christy o'connor jnr'), appears in any list at 2nd place or better. We see that 'david graham' appears at '1st place'. But we also see that 'sandy lyle' (1st) has a higher score than Christy O'Connor Jnr (3rd). Thus Sandy and christy o'connor jnr are not tied.\n\n   Since the second player, christy o'connor jnr ('christy o'connor jnr'), appears at '3rd place', it means that this player is tied with tony johnstone and d a weibring.\n\n6. Now let's check if the third player, d a weibring ('d a weibring'), appears in any list at 2nd place or better. We see that 'christy o'connor jnr', 'tony johnstone' are both tied with him at '3rd place'.\n\n   Thus, d a weibring is also tied with christy o'connor jnr and tony johnstone.\n\n7. Finally, because there are three players ('christy o'connor jnr', 'd a weibring', 'tony johnstone') all at the 3rd position that have even scores ('140'), this means they can be tied with each other.\n\n    This is also true since these players appear only in the list at '3rd place'.\n\n8. Since there are indeed three players ('christy o'connor jnr', 'd a weibring', and 'tony johnstone') who are all tied with even scores, this means the claim that \"there be 3 player tie at 3rd at even to par\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"to_par\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to_par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to_par\"}\n  ]\n}",

Check if there are exactly 4 Australian players among those mentioned in the statement: Wayne Riley was found to be from England (in Step 2), so he does not meet the criteria of the claim.\n\n7. Confirm that there are indeed four other Australian players mentioned in the statement: From Step 4, we know there are at least four Australian players on the leaderboard.\n\n8. Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on steps 6 and 7: Since only three out of the four players are from Australia (david graham, sandy lyle, tony johnstone, d a weibring, and peter senior), but the claim includes wayne riley who isn't, then the statement has to be FALSE\n\n### Output\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"australia\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"scotland\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"zimbabwe\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"united states\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"england\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"west germany\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"england\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"australia\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"spain\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"australia\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\",\n      \"value\": \"australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This means we need to check if there are three players tied at exactly the same score for the 2nd place.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that there is a 3-way tie at the 2nd place (t2). The scores of these three players are: 140, 140, and 140.\n\n3. Now, we need to check if these three players have the same score relative to par. According to the table, the scores of these three players are already tied on par with -1, e, and +1 respectively.\n\n4. Since there is no indication that any of the players in this tie has a different relationship between their total score and par, we can conclude that they indeed have the same relationship (i.e., all 3-way ties at 2nd place be even to par) given the data provided.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Check if there is a 3-player tie at 2nd place\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Check if the scores of these three players are equal\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Check if the relationship between their total score and par is equal\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to_par\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to_par\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to_par\"}]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Conclude that the 3 players tie at 2nd place be even to par\",\n            \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}",
