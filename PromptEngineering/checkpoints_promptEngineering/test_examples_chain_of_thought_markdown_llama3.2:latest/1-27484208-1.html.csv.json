First, we need to compare the world rank by the WUR (World University Rankings, 2013) of Dartmouth College with the world rank by the WUR of The University of T\u00fcbingen.\n2. According to the table, Dartmouth College has a world rank by the WUR of 126th in 2013, while The University of T\u00fcbingen has a world rank by the WUR of 201 - 225th in 2013.\n3. Since 126 is less than any value between 201 and 225, Dartmouth College ranks higher than The University of T\u00fcbingen according to the World University Rankings.\n\n2. Next, we need to compare the world rank by ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities, 2013) of Dartmouth College with the world rank by ARWU of The University of T\u00fcbingen.\n3. According to the table, Dartmouth College has a world rank by ARWU of 151 - 200th in 2013, while The University of T\u00fcbingen has a world rank by ARWU of 151 - 200th as well.\n4. Since both rankings are between 151 and 200, we need to compare their upper limits.\n5. Dartmouth College's upper limit is 200th, while The University of T\u00fcbingen's upper limit is also 200th.\n\n6. According to the table, Dartmouth College has a world rank by QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) of 113th in 2013, while The University of T\u00fcbingen has a world rank by QS of 144th.\n7.

Durham University was established in 1769, while UWA was established in 1911.\n\nSince UWA's rankings are relatively close across all three categories, and it is more recent than Durham University, this could suggest that UWA has a stronger reputation or better resources despite its late date of establishment.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the rankings, while UWA performs slightly better in some areas compared to Durham, its overall performance might be comparable due to the difference in their establishment dates.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n1. **Read the Claim**: Understand what the claim about Durham University is stating.\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - The relevant data for this claim can be found in the table under \"world rank by wur , 2013\" which is located at row index 1, column name \"world rank by wur , 2013\".\n   - We need to compare this value with \"second-best\" which could imply the rank just below the given one.\n3. **Determine the Rank**: \n   - The rank of Durham University in the world according to WUR (2013) is stated as 80th.\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - If the claim states that Durham University has \"the second-best\" rank, it implies there should be a specific rank right below them.\n   - Looking at the table, for WUR (2013), there are ranks both above and below 80th.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process Continued\n5. **Clarify \"Second-Best\"**: Understanding \"second-best\" means looking for the next lower rank than the one stated (in this case, the 80th position).\n6. **Identifying Ranks Around Durham University\u2019s Rank**:\n   - The WUR (2013) ranks are not explicitly listed in a sequential manner around Durham's rank (80th), but we can infer there is at least one rank lower than 80th since the table does not provide every single ranking from just below to exactly above or at 80th.\n7. **Conclusion**: Given that Durham University\u2019s actual WUR (2013) position is 80th, and acknowledging that \"second-best\" might imply a specific placement just below, without an explicit ranking listed in the table immediately preceding or succeeding 80th for direct comparison, it appears there's ambiguity in how to interpret \"the second-best rank.\"\n\n### Final Answer\nGiven the provided explanation, it seems challenging to definitively declare the claim as true based on the given table data without making assumptions about what \"second-best\" implies. However, the question asks strictly for a JSON output with a TRUE or FALSE answer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Read and understand the claim\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Identify relevant data: world rank by wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Determine that there isn't explicit ranking just below 80th in table\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Clarify 'second-best' means looking for next lower rank than stated (in this case, the 80th position)\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Acknowledge ambiguity due to missing sequential rankings around Durham\u2019s actual WUR (2013) rank\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"description\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to determine what rankings we should look at to evaluate the claim about the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\n2. We see that there are three different rankings provided: wur (World Universities Ranking), arwu (Academic Ranking of World Universities), and qs (Quacquarelli Symonds Ranking).\n\n3. For each ranking, we need to check if the University of T\u00fcbingen has the worst rank among all the universities listed.\n\n4. Looking at the \"world rank by wur , 2013\" column, we see that the University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked 201-225th.\n\n5. Now let's move on to the other rankings:\n    - For arwu (Academic Ranking of World Universities), the University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked between 151-200th.\n    - For qs (Quacquarelli Symonds Ranking), the University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked 144th.\n\n6. Since we are looking for whether the claim about the University of T\u00fcbingen having the worst rank in every single ranking, we can see that it doesn't have the worst rank in wur but does in arwu and qs.\n\n7. However, if we take \"worst\" to mean the lowest rank overall, then we do have to consider that the wur has a much lower range of 201-225 whereas the arwu has a higher range of 151-200th and qs ranks at 144th which is lower than both the ranges provided for wur.\n\n8. However, looking closely at our table we see that there are other universities ranked worse than t\u00fcbingen by wur but better than t\u00fcbingen in some rankings like arwu and qs so we have to be careful about our wording here because \"worst\" could mean different things. We should consider it as having the lowest rank.\n\n9. Since T\u00fcbingen is not the lowest ranked university in all three rankings (it's not wur), but it does have a lower ranking than many universities listed (specifically qs) in two out of the three, we need to use \"worst\" strictly to mean \"lowest\".\n\n10. Hence our conclusion is that University of T\u00fcbingen does indeed have the worst rank overall based on having the lowest ranked number.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Determine which rankings to look at.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check wur ranking.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Check arwu ranking.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check qs ranking.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if T\u00fcbingen has the worst rank based on wur and lower rankings by other institutions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if T\u00fcbingen has the lowest rank overall.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Consider what it means for t\u00fcbingen to have a worst ranking in every single ranking\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if T\u00fcbingen has the lowest rank overall based on having the lowest ranked number.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"arwu ranking\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"qs ranking\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
