This means we need to check if there are any games where Wildcats scored more than 7 points while still losing.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the relevant information in the table\nTo evaluate this claim, we need to look at the rows where \"result\" is \"loss\" (indicating a loss) and also find the corresponding values of \"wildcats points\".\n\n### Step 3: Examine each row where Wildcats lose\nLet's go through each row with a \"loss\" in \"result\":\n\n- Row 1: Wildcats lost, but no points scored.\n- Row 7: Wildcats lost, but only 0 points were scored. This score is indeed less than or equal to 7.\n- Row 10: Wildcats lost, and they scored 6 points.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the validity of the claim\nFrom our examination in step 3, we see that for both rows where Wildcats lost, their points were indeed less than or equal to 7. However, there was an oversight in step 3 where row 1's \"wildcats points\" was noted as '7' without realizing this was part of the claim being tested directly.\n\n### Step 5: Correcting oversight and finalize evaluation\nGiven that Wildcats scored exactly 7 points in one game while losing (Row 1), this contradicts the statement that they never score more than 7 in any loss.

In game 3, the Wildcats scored 20 points. In game 4, the Wildcats scored 26 points. In game 5, the Wildcats scored 14 points. In game 6, the Wildcats scored 7 points. However, for a claim to be TRUE, we need to identify if any of these games has the Wildcats scoring more than 7 points.\n\n### Step 3: Check game 4 and game 5 again\nUpon reviewing again, in game 4, there was an error; the cell value is listed as \"20\" (not 26). In reality, the wildcats won with a score of 20-0. However, we see that the opponent's points are not available for this game. Since only one number is given and it's stated in the row description, \"3 - 1 , 20\", the 20 refers to Wildcats' score in the game.\n\nIn game 5, again, there was an error; the cell value should be interpreted as the Wildcats scored 14 points with the opponent having a score of zero. The claim is checking if any Wildcats score more than seven points in games they win.\n\n### Step 4: Check game 6\nThe Wildcats won this game, scoring 7 points against an opponent who scored 6 points. However, the score of the opponents isn't clearly described as such (it's written \"scored six\" and it appears that only one number is given for each team).\n\nGiven these games where the wildcats win with more than 7 points: \n- game 2: Wildcats' points were 20\n- game 3: Wildcats' points were also 20\n- game 4: Only 20 (not 26) - the correct description of \"3-1,20\" is that Wildcats scored 20 points while their opponent scored zero.\n- game 5: The wildcats scored 14 with a zero as the score for the opponents. \nIn summary, we find several games where the wildcats win and they have more than seven points.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nBased on step 4, we can conclude that the claim \"the Wildcats never scores more than 7 point in any game they win\" is FALSE since there are multiple instances of the Wildcats winning games with scores above 7 points.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the games where the Wildcats won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Look for games where the Wildcats scored more than 7 points in a game they won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Check game 4 and game 5 again\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check game 6\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This is our first relevant cell: `{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}`\n\n3. **Locate November losses**: We find another loss in November by searching the table for October 25th and looking at row 6, where we see that it's a win with 7 points; however, this isn't what we're looking for, but then we look at row 7, which is a loss with 0 points on November 1st. This is our second relevant cell: `{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}`\n\n4. **Check if losses in September and November match the claim**: We found two losses, but we need to check if they occurred in the respective months mentioned (September for the first loss and November for the second). Given that the only date mentioned in row 1 is sept 20th (indicating September), this supports our initial conclusion. For the second loss, since it's on Nov 1st, it indicates an occurrence of a loss in November.\n\n5. **Verify if losses match the claim**: Both losses we found indeed happened in the respective months (September and November). Now, we must check if they were only two games lost overall to confirm the truth of the statement about both instances being within those specified months.\n\n\n6.  **Finalize Claim evaluation:**\n    To determine the truth of the statement, verify that each loss was one game against a single opponent. For September's claim, there is one loss with opponent ole miss; and for November, there is also one loss with an opponent alabama.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}",

Since game 4 starts with \"oct\", it's clear that game 4 was not played in september but rather in october.\n\n#### Step 3: Extract the date for game 2 from the table\nThe date for game 2 is sept 27.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if games 2 and 4 were played in October\nAccording to the table, games 3, 4, and 5 were played on consecutive days starting from oct 4. Since game 4 starts with \"oct\", it's clear that both games 2 and 4 were not played in september but rather in october.\n\n#### Step 5: Extract the date for game 1 from the table\nThe date for game 1 is sept 20.\n\n#### Step 6: Check if game 1 was played in November\nAccording to the table, game 1 starts with \"sept\", which indicates that it's a month before october. Since there are no games scheduled for sept after game 1, it means game 1 is the last game of september.\n\n#### Step 7: Check if games 1 and 4 were played in September\nFrom steps 5 and 6, we know that game 1 was played on sept 20, which makes it true that both games 1 and 4 were played in september.\n\n#### Step 8: Extract the date for game 3 from the table\nThe date for game 3 is oct 4.\n\n#### Step 9: Check if game 3 was played in November\nAccording to the table, games 7 and 8 were played on consecutive days starting from nov 1. Since game 3 starts with \"oct\", it's clear that both games 2 and 3 were not played in november but rather in october.\n\n#### Step 10: Check if games 5 and 6 were played in November\nAccording to the table, games 7, 8, 9, and 10 were played on consecutive days starting from nov 1. Since game 6 starts with \"nov\", it's clear that both games 3 and 6 were not played in november but rather in october.\n\n#### Step 11: Extract the date for game 7 from the table\nThe date for game 7 is nov 1.\n\n#### Step 12: Check if game 7 was played in October\nAccording to the table, there are no games scheduled before game 7. This means that both games 6 and 7 were not played in october but rather in november.\n\n#### Step 13: Check if games 2, 5, and 8 were played in November\nFrom steps 11 and 12, we know that games 7 and 8 were played on nov 1 and nov 8 respectively. This means game 5 was the last of october's games which is also correct as both game 4 and 5 starts with \"oct\" . Now checking the claim \"the wildcat play 4 game in september , 2 game in october , and 2 game in november\". From steps 3-12 we know that:\n\n*   Game 1 was played on sept 20\n*   Games 2,4 were played on consecutive days starting from sept 27 and oct 11 respectively.\n*   Games 5 was played last of october (starts with \"oct\") on oct 18 which means that games 3 , 4, and 5 were the only games in october\n*   Games 7, 8, 9, and 10 were played on consecutive days starting from nov 1.\n*   The above means we can confirm for game 2 (sept 27) and game 4 (oct 11)\n*   Games 3 and 6 were the only games in october so it confirms that the claim is correct for these two. Game 6 was played on oct 25\n*   Since games 1,2, and 4 where played at different dates in sept, we know that game 1 was the last of september, therefore the claim that \"the wildcat play 4 game in september\" is true because game 4 was played on 11th which starts with oct but since it's mentioned to be \"sept\", game 2 (sept 27) and game 4 (oct 11) are also correct.\n*   Games 3,4, and 5 were the only games in october so we can confirm that for these three games. \n*   Games 6 and 7 were not played in october but rather in november.\n*   Since the above information holds true from steps 1-13 , it means that claim is correct.\n\n#### Step 14: Extract the relevant cells\nWe need to extract all the cells containing \"sept\", \"oct\" or \"nov\" as they are relevant for determining if the wildcats played 4 games in september,2 games in october, and 2 games in november.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"sept\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"sept\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"oct\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nov\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarification.",

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the claim**: The claim states that the most a Wildcat team can outscore an opponent by is 26 points.\n\n2. **Identify relevant data**: We need to look at the \"wildcats points\" column and compare it with the \"opponents points\" column to find instances where the difference between Wildcats' score and their opponents' score exceeds 26 points, as well as identify when they do not exceed 26 points.\n\n3. **Look for maximum lead instances**: Review each game to find instances where Wildcats have outscored an opponent by 26 points or more. If no such instance is found, the claim could be true.\n\n4. **Consider tie records**: Wildcat record of \"20\" in column \"record\" on row #4 indicates they were tied with 9 georgia after a win (see above). The same applies to other columns for which there are two values - the first value refers to that particular game while the second is the Wildcat's overall record.\n\n5. **Look for minimum lead instances**: Review each game to find instances where Wildcats have outscored an opponent by 26 points or less.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning in more detail:\n\n- Looking at row #4 of table, on that date Wildcats score 26 while opponents also get zero points.\n- On row #5 of table, Wildcats again outscore their opponent with the same amount of 0 points they scored against Wildcats and total Wildcat points of 14.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on all these observations, we can see there are at least two instances where Wildcats' score exceeds that of an opponents by more than 26. The statement is thus false.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The claim states the most Wildcat outscore their opponent by 26 points.\",\n      \"type\": \"claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"We have to look at the table and determine how many times Wildcats outscore opponents by more than, exactly equal to or less than 26 points.\",\n      \"type\": \"data_needed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Review each game of Wildcat's point scores with their opponent scores in that game to identify instances where they do not exceed the claim stated in the question.\",\n      \"type\": \"max_leads\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Check for tie records on columns with two values, like game #4.\",\n      \"type\": \"tie_records\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
