    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the condition for the claim\nTo verify if the claim is true, we need to determine how many home teams have a score higher than 10.0.\n\n### Step 2: Examine each row of the table\nWe will go through each row in the table and check if the home team's score is greater than 10.0.\n\n### Step 3: Check hawthorn's score\nThe score for Hawthorn (14.12) is indeed higher than 10.0, so this row satisfies the condition.\n\n### Step 4: Check fitzroy's score\nThe score for Fitzroy (8.10) is less than 10.0, so this row does not satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 5: Check richmond's score\nThe score for Richmond (8.18) is also less than 10.0, so this row does not satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 6: Check geelong's score\nThe score for Geelong (7.10) is less than 10.0, so this row does not satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 7: Check essendon's score\nThe score for Essendon (12.9) is indeed higher than 10.0, so this row satisfies the condition.\n\n### Step 8: Check south melbourne's score\nThe score for South Melbourne (10.12) is also higher than 10.0, so this row satisfies the condition.\n\n### Step 9: Count the number of home teams with scores higher than 10.0\nWe have found that 3 out of 5 rows satisfy the condition.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince there are indeed more than half of the home teams (3/5) with a score higher than 10.0, the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\"step\": 1, \"text\": \"Identify the condition for the claim\"},\n        {\"step\": 2, \"text\": \"Examine each row of the table\"},\n        {\"step\": 3, \"text\": \"Check hawthorn's score (row_index=0, column_name='home team')\"},\n        {\"step\": 4, \"text\": \"Check fitzroy's score (row_index=1, column_name='home team')\"},\n        {\"step\": 5, \"text\": \"Check richmond's score (row_index=2, column_name='home team')\"},\n        {\"step\": 6, \"text\": \"Check geelong's score (row_index=3, column_name='home team')\"},\n        {\"step\": 7, \"text\": \"Check essendon's score (row_index=4, column_name='home team')\"},\n        {\"step\": 8, \"text\": \"Check south melbourne's score (row_index=5, column_name='home team')\"},\n        {\"step\": 9, \"text\": \"Count the number of home teams with scores higher than 10.0\"}\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n    ]\n}",
