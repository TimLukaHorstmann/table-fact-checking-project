This contradicts part of the claim that says \"3 player be not of canadian nationality and they be Miloslav guren\". So, this already indicates the claim is false.\n\n2. **Check nationality for Martin Hohenberger**: According to the table, Martin Hohenberger's nationality is Austria, not Canada. The claim does include him as one of the players that are not Canadian, so this supports the claim being false.\n\n3. **Check nationality for Niklas Anger**: According to the table, Niklas Anger's nationality is Sweden, not Canada. This further supports the claim being false because it includes another non-Canadian player.\n\n4. Conclusion: Since at least one of the players (Miloslav Guren) in the claim does not match the nationality given in the table, the entire claim cannot be true.
