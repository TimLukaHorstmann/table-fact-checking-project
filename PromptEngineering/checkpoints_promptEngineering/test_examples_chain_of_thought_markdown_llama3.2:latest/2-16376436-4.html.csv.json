    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that in game 17, the Los Angeles Raiders played the San Diego Chargers with a score of W 17 - 12 and attendance 62593.\n\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check if the Los Angeles Raiders are actually listed as playing against the San Diego Chargers in game 17.\n\n3. Looking at the table, we see that in row 16, the Minnesota Vikings played against the San Diego Chargers with a score of W 28 - 24 and attendance 53899. This suggests that the team playing the San Diego Chargers in game 17 might be the Minnesota Vikings rather than the Los Angeles Raiders.\n\n4. The only other possibility is if the Los Angeles Raiders are listed as playing against the San Diego Chargers, but since they played in row 15, it's likely that this game was actually the one mentioned in row 16 (or possibly row 17).\n\n5. However, looking at the table again, we see that the Los Angeles Raiders are not explicitly listed as playing in either of those games.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE because it's unclear whether the Los Angeles Raiders played against the San Diego Chargers in game 17 or if there was a mix-up with another team like the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The date in that row is \"september 30 , 1990\", and its corresponding team is listed as \"chicago bears\". This verifies that the attendance on that date was indeed against the Chicago Bears.\n\n2. Check if the attendance for the game on September 30, 1990 was 80156.\n   - The relevant cell to check can be found in the same row as above (week 4) and is listed under the \"attendance\" column. This value should match 80156.\n\n3. Verify that the highest attendance among all games throughout the season was indeed at this game against the Chicago Bears on September 30, 1990.\n   - Check if the attendance of 80156 in week 4 is higher than any other attendance recorded throughout the rest of the table.\n     - For each row after week 4 (i.e., weeks 5 to 17), check if the attendance in that row exceeds 80156. If not, then 80156 holds as the highest attendance found so far.\n\n4. Confirm whether the highest attendance on September 30, 1990 is correct by verifying that there are no other games with higher attendance.\n   - Check every row in the table for higher attendance than what was recorded for week 4 (i.e., a lower attendance or an equal one) and ensure no game had more attendees than this date.\n\nStep-by-step chain of thought:\n\n- Week 1 to 3: Attendance is verified to be against the Denver Broncos, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Seattle Seahawks respectively.\n- Week 4: The claim checks out because the attendance was indeed against the Chicago Bears on September 30, 1990, with 80156 attendees.

However, since row 9 mentions a loss with this score, we need to focus on row 9.\n\n3. **Verify each condition**:\n   - For the score of 9 - 7: The table indeed shows that on week 9 (November 4, 1990), the final result was \"l 9 - 7\", which matches our claim.\n   - For the week being 10: The table shows that on week 10 (November 11, 1990), the attendance is given but we need to look at the results, not just the week number. However, this doesn't affect our initial verification of the score and opponent conditions.\n   - For the opponent being San Diego Chargers: Since row 9 has a loss with the specified score, it verifies the claim regarding the opponent.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the verification that all conditions are met (score = 9 - 7, week = 10, opponent = San diego chargers), we can determine the answer to the claim.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim: The claim states that when the score is 9 - 7, the week is 10, and the opponent is San Diego Chargers.\",\n      \"info\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate the relevant cells in the table\",\n      \"cell_info\": [\n        {\n          \"column_name\": \"result\",\n          \"row_index\": 9\n        },\n        {\n          \"column_name\": \"week\",\n          \"row_index\": 9,\n          \"value\": \"10\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent\",\n          \"row_index\": 9,\n          \"value\": \"San diego chargers\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify each condition: For the score of 9 - 7, The table indeed shows that on week 9 (November 4, 1990), the final result was \\\"l 9 - 7\\\", which matches our claim.\",\n      \"info\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify each condition: For the week being 10\",\n      \"info\": \"The table shows that on week 10 (November 11, 1990),\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify each condition: For the opponent being San Diego Chargers\",\n      \"info\": \"Since row 9 has a loss with the specified score,\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion: Based on the verification that all conditions are met (score = 9 - 7, week = 10, opponent = San diego chargers), we can determine the answer to the claim.\",\n      \"info\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
