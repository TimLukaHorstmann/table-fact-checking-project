It has scores, venues and dates like the first one.\n   - However, I need more information from other cells about this second 2014 fifa world cup qualifier.\n\n2. Next, let's find out if there are two entries with a score of 5 - 0 in the table for the \"2014 fifa world cup qualifying\" competition. \n   - The first entry has a score of 5 - 0 and the venue is \"estadi comunal , andorra la vella\".\n   - For the second entry, I need to find out if there's also an entry with a score of 5-0 for this same type of competition.\n\n3.

Now let's check if there are two entries with a score of 1-1 in the table for the \"2014 fifa world cup qualifying\" competition.\n   - The first entry has a score of 5 - 0, which is not 1-1.\n   - However, I do see an entry with a score of 3 - 1 (1-1 as well), however it does belong to the \"2014 fifa world cup qualifying\" but I don't know if it belongs to the same competition mentioned in the claim.\n\n5. Finally let's check for both scores and venues.\n   - The first entry has a score of 5-0 with venue estadi comunal , andorra la vella, which matches the claim.\n   - However for the second one I don't have enough information about the exact competition to confirm that this one also belongs to the \"2014 fifa world cup qualifying\".\n\n\nHere is my response in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"there are two competitions of type uefa euro 2012 qualifying\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"7 september 2010\", \"8 october 2010\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"there is an entry with a score of 5 - 0 for the first competition\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"7 september 2012\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"there is no entry with a score of 5 - 0 for the second type of competition\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"there are two entries with scores of 3-1 which also belong to 2014 fifa world cup qualifying but we don't know if they are the same competition\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"16 october 2012\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"there is an entry with a score of 5 - 0 for the first type of competition, venue estadi comunal , andorra la vella\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"7 september 2012\", \"estadi comunal , andorra la vella\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"we don't have enough information to confirm that this one also belongs to the same competition mentioned in the claim \",\n      \"relevant_cells\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}",

Now, we need to check if there are only one rows related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition.\n   From step 2, we know that there is only one row for this competition in cell | date              | venue                             | score   | result   | competition                    | (row index 7).\n   \n4. Next, we need to check if the score of 5 - 0 is present on the venue Estadi Comunal, Andorra La Vella.\n   We can see that there is a row with date \"7 september 2012\", venue \"estadi comunal , andorra la vella\" and score 5-0 in cell | date              | venue                             | score   | result   | competition                    | (row index 7).\n\n5.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim to be evaluated is: \"when the result be 1 - 1, the date be 8 october 2010 with a score of 3 - 1 and venue of pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\".\n\n### Step 2: Check if there are multiple dates for a 1-1 result\nLooking at the table, we can see that there is indeed one date where the result was 1-1: \"16 october 2012\". However, the claim specifically mentions \"8 october 2010\", which does not have a result of 1-1.\n\n### Step 3: Check if there are multiple dates with different scores for a 1-1 result\nSince the table has only one instance where the result is 1-1 and that's on \"16 october 2012\" (result 1-1, date 16 october 2012), we can conclude this date matches our claim.\n\n### Step 4: Check if there are multiple venues for a 1-1 result\nHowever, the venue mentioned in the table is only for one instance of a 1-1 result on \"16 october 2012\", and that's Pusk\u00e1s stadium, Budapest. So we have to conclude our claim was correct since it matches exactly.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble all steps into a chain_of_thought\n```\nchain_of_thought:\n1. Claim is about date, score, result, competition, and venue.\n2. We need to verify that the date \"8 october 2010\" is indeed where result = 3 - 1 on that exact date.\n3. Verify that there are no other dates with a different score for a 1-1 result.\n4. The only matching record with our claim has Pusk\u00e1s stadium, Budapest as venue and the result being 1-1 which exactly matches what we're looking for in the chain_of_thought.\n5. All checks pass.\n```\n\n### Step 6: Determine the final answer\nOur steps confirm that there is indeed one match where result = 3 - 1 on date \"8 october 2010\" and that venue was Pusk\u00e1s stadium, Budapest. Hence, our claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
