However, since his term end indicates that he is currently a member and has been for many years (1999-2002), it suggests he was indeed a member of the party when he started.\n     * Bashkim Fino: `1962 -` means he is still alive; like Ilir Meta, being born does not imply membership. However, his term end indicates that he has been a member for many years (1997-2000).\n     * Ylli Bufi: `1948 -` means he passed away; being born implies that at some point, he was a member of the party.\n     * Pandeli Majko (1st time): `1967 -` means he is still alive; his term end indicates that he has been a member for many years (1998-1999).\n\n3. **Determine if each individual meets the claim's criteria**:\n   - Based on the table, Ylli Bufi was indeed a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Ilir Meta and Bashkim Fino were both members during their terms.\n\n4. **Evaluate the entire claim**: The claim specifies four individuals, all of whom are confirmed to have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania at some point in their careers as per the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 8,\n        \"column_name\": \"born\"\n      },\n      \"reasoning\": \"Ilir Meta's birth does not confirm membership, but his term end indicates he has been a member.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 7,\n        \"column_name\": \"term_end\"\n      },\n      \"reasoning\": \"Bashkim Fino's term end confirms his membership during this period.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"column_name\": \"born\"\n      },\n      \"reasoning\": \"Ylli Bufi's birth implies he was a member at some point.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"term_start\"\n      },\n      \"reasoning\": \"Pandeli Majko (1st time) started his term as a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"born\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"term_end\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"born\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"term_start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, we need to check if there was any election or party membership change between then.\n\n3. **Find the relevant cell for Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's last term and Sali Berisha's first term**:\nFor Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi: The table shows he ended his term on 11 March 1997.\nFor Sali Berisha: We need to check when he became a member of the Democratic Party of Albania, which is after his term start.\n\n4. **Identify relevant cells for subsequent terms (if needed) and party memberships**:\nWe should verify if there was any change in party membership or election between Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's last term and Sali Berisha's first term. However, since the question focuses on being elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi, this step is crucial but not directly relevant.\n\n5. **Analyze if Sali Berisha was elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania**:\nWe need to check if there was any election or party membership change that makes Sali Berisha's election as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's last term.\n\n6. **Find Sali Berisha's first term start date and end date in the table**:\nSali Berisha started his term on 11 September 2005 and ended it on 15 September 2013.\n\n7. **Determine if there was any election or party membership change between Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's last term (1997) and Sali Berisha's first term start date (2005)**:\nLooking at the table, we can see that there were changes in prime ministers and parties between 1991 and 2002 but no direct information about a change in party membership for Sali Berisha. We do know he became a member of the Democratic Party of Albania during his time as Prime Minister.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\nBased on the analysis, it seems that Sali Berisha indeed became a member of the Democratic Party of Albania after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's last term (1997).

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim:** The claim states \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect\". This means we need to find out if there is only one individual who has been both a prime minister of Albania and a member of the Party of Labour of Albania (PLA).\n\n2. **Locate relevant cells in the table:**\n   - For \"Party of Labour of Albania\" members, we need to look at rows where this party appears as either the name or part of the name.\n     - Relevant row for PLA:\n       ```\n       | name                         | born - died                  | term start                   | term end                     | political party              |\n       | fatos nano (1st time)        | prime ministers 1991 onwards | prime ministers 1991 onwards | prime ministers 1991 onwards | party of labour of albania   |\n       ```\n   \n   - For \"elect\" as a title, it appears in every row where the name is \"prime ministers\".\n     - Relevant cells for primes:\n       ```\n       | prime ministers 1991 onwards | prime ministers 1991 onwards | prime ministers 1991 onwards | prime ministers 1991 onwards |\n       ```\n\n3. **Identify individuals who have been both prime minister and member of PLA:**\n   - From the given data, there is no direct overlap between \"prime ministers\" (elect) title rows and \"party of labour of albania\" name or part thereof. However, we can verify this by checking if any individual appears under both categories.\n\n4. **Verify absence of overlap between the two:**\n   - Upon reviewing each relevant cell again, it becomes clear that while some prime ministers had a connection to the PLA party (as seen in fatos nano), none appear directly listed with \"prime minister\" and as part of the name \"party of labour of albania\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Based on the absence of overlap between prime ministers holding the title \"elect\" versus being members of the PLA party, there is indeed only one individual where this condition (being a member of the Party of Labour of Albania while also being an elect) could potentially be true: fatos nano.\n\n6. **Correcting conclusion:** It turns out that upon closer inspection, it was found to actually be true for fatos nano - since his name includes \"party of labour of albania\" and he is listed as prime minister at different times.\n\n7. **Finalize reasoning steps in JSON format:**\n   ```\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       {\n         \"description\": \"Identify claim statement\",\n         \"relevant_cell\": {\n           \"row_index\": 1,\n           \"column_name\": \"\"\n         }\n       },\n       {\n         \"description\": \"Locate cells for party of labour of albania (PLA)\",\n         \"relevant_cell\": {\n           \"row_index\": 4,\n           \"column_name\": \"party of labour of albania\"\n         }\n       },\n       {\n         \"description\": \"Identify primes\",\n         \"relevant_cells\": [\n           {\n             \"row_index\": 3,\n             \"column_name\": \"\"\n           },\n           {\n             \"row_index\": 4,\n             \"column_name\": \"\"\n           },\n           {\n             \"row_index\": 5,\n             \"column_name\": \"\"\n           }\n         ]\n       },\n       {\n         \"description\": \"Verify absence of overlap between PLA party and prime ministers\",\n         \"relevant_cell\": {\n           \"row_index\": null,\n           \"column_name\": null\n         }\n       },\n       {\n         \"description\": \"Conclusion based on verification\",\n         \"relevant_cell\": {\n           \"row_index\": 4,\n           \"column_name\": \"\"\n         }\n       },\n       {\n         \"description\": \"Correcting conclusion based on reevaluation of data\",\n         \"relevant_cell\": {\n           \"row_index\": 4,\n           \"column_name\": \"\"\n         }\n       }\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 4,\n         \"column_name\": \"\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 4,\n         \"column_name\": \"\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n#### Output in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify claim statement\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Locate cells for party of labour of albania (PLA)\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"party of labour of albania\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify primes\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Verify absence of overlap between PLA party and prime ministers\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": null,\n        \"column_name\": null\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion based on verification\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Correcting conclusion based on reevaluation of data\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant cells are:\n| row_index | column_name   |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| 5         | term end       |\n| 13        | term end       |\n\nYlli Bufi's term end is: 10 December 1991\nAleksand\u00ebr Meksi's term end is: 11 March 1997\n\n### Step 2: Compare the term end dates\nNext, we compare the term end dates of Ylli Bufi and Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to see if the former ends before or after the latter.\n\n10 December 1991 (Ylli Bufi) < 11 March 1997 (Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi)\n\n### Step 3: Determine if the claim is true or false\nBased on the comparison, since Ylli Bufi's term end date (10 December 1991) ends before Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's term end date (11 March 1997), the claim \"the term end for Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi be after the term end for Ylli Bufi\" is FALSE.\n\n### Step 4: Output the final answer in JSON format\nHere is the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"term end\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"term end\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}",

We will look at the \"born\" column for relevant dates and the \"political party\" column for affiliations.\n\n### Step 3: Compare relevant information\nAleksand\u00ebr Meksi's term ended on March 11, 1997 (according to the table). Ilir Meta started his term in October 1999, which is after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's term. However, we also need to verify if Ilir Meta was elected into the Democratic Party of Albania during this period.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the claim\nIlir Meta was indeed a member of the Socialist Party of Albania at the time he became Prime Minister in October 1999, not the Democratic Party as required by the claim. Therefore, Ilir Meta does not meet the criteria specified in the claim.\n\n### Step 5: Create the JSON output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identified the claim to be evaluated\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determined relevant information from the table\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare relevant information from the table\",\n      \"description\": \"\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 12,\n          \"column_name\": \"born\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 13,\n          \"column_name\": \"political party\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Evaluate the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 12,\n          \"column_name\": \"born\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 13,\n          \"column_name\": \"political party\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
