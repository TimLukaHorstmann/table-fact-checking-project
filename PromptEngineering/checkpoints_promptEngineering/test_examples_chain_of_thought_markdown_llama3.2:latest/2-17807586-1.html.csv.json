This step involves looking at the specific words used in the description for both years.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Truthfulness Based on Findings\nWe then compare our findings from the previous steps with the claim statement to determine its truthfulness. If any part of the claim matches what we've found, it's considered true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Step 5: Identify Relevant Cells\nLastly, we identify which specific cells in the table support or contradict our conclusion about the claim's truthfulness. This involves pinpointing the exact row and column where relevant information was found or not found.\n\nNow, let's implement these steps with actual code (for simplicity, I will use Python):\n\n```python\n# Define the table data as a list of lists in Python format\ntable_data = [\n    [\"year\", \"winners\", \"location\", \"event director\", \"winner 's prize\"],\n    [\"2013\", \"kevin bowerman and raymond gao (nc)\", \"washington , dc\", \"john chew\", \"us10000\"],\n    [\"2012\", \"andy hoang & erik salgado (nc)\", \"orlando , fl\", \"john chew\", \"us10000\"],\n    [\"2011\", \"alex li & jackson smylie (on)\", \"orlando , fl\", \"john chew\", \"us10000\"],\n    [\"2010\", \"evan mccarthy & bradley robbins (nh)\", \"orlando , fl\", \"ben greenwood\", \"us10000\"],\n    [\"2009\", \"andy hoang & erik salgado (nc)\", \"providence , ri\", \"ben greenwood\", \"us5000\"],\n    [\"2008\", \"loganrosen & matthewsilver (ct)\", \"providence , ri\", \"ben greenwood\", \"us5000\"],\n    [\"2007\", \"aune mitchell & matthew silver (ct)\", \"providence , ri\", \"ben greenwood\", \"us5000\"],\n    [\"2006\", \"aaronjacobs & nathanmendelsohn (ma)\", \"boston , ma\", \"ben greenwood\", \"us5000\"],\n    [\"2005\", \"scott cardone & asif rahman (oh)\", \"boston , ma\", \"ben (loiterstein) greenwood\", \"us5000\"],\n    [\"2004\", \"thomas bao & eric johnston (ca)\", \"boston , ma\", \"ben loiterstein & joe edley\", \"us5000\"],\n    [\"2003\", \"nickamphlett & johnezekowitz (ma)\", \"boston , ma\", \"ben loiterstein & joe edley\", \"us5000\"]\n]\n\n# Find the prize details for each year\nprize_2008 = None\nprize_2009 = None\n\nfor row in table_data[1:]:\n    if int(row[0]) == 2008:\n        prize_2008 = row[4]\n    elif int(row[0]) == 2009:\n        prize_2009 = row[4]\n\n# Check if the prize double is mentioned\nis_double_mentioned_2008 = \"double\" in prize_2008.lower()\nis_double_mentioned_2009 = \"double\" in prize_2009.lower()\n\n# Determine truthfulness based on findings\nclaim_true = is_double_mentioned_2008 and is_double_mentioned_2009\n\n# Identify relevant cells\nrelevant_cells = []\nif int(table_data[0][0]) == 2008:\n    relevant_cells.append({\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner 's prize\"})\nif int(table_data[0][0]) == 2009:\n    relevant_cells.append({\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner 's prize\"})\n\n# Output the final answer in JSON format\nprint({\n  \"chain_of_thought\": f\"The prize for winning the national school scrabble championship double from {table_data[0][1]} to {table_data[0][3]} has a 'double' mention in both {2008} and {2009}'s prizes.

These are rows 1 (2013), 5 (2005), and 6 (2004).\n\n#### Step 3: Verify if the years range within the specified timeframe\nEnsure that each year mentioned in step 2 falls within the specified period of 2003 to 2013.\n\n#### Step 4: Count the number of North Carolina champions within the timeframe\nCount the total number of champion winners from North Carolina between 2003 and 2013 identified in steps 2 and 3.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if the count meets or exceeds three champions\nCompare the count obtained in step 4 with three.

The table contains information about past winners and their corresponding states.\n2. By examining each entry, we find the following relevant data:\n\t* In 2013, Kevin Bowerman and Raymond Gao (NC) won.\n\t* In 2009, Andy Hoang and Erik Salgado (NC) won.\n\t* In 2011, Alex Li and Jackson Smylie (ON) did not win in NC; this row is irrelevant to the claim. However, another relevant year for ON was missed - it's actually irrelevant to the year range specified.\n3. Counting relevant champion years:\n\t+ 2009 has 2 winners from North Carolina.\n\t+ There are no other relevant winner entries for NC between 2003 and 2009 (as stated in step 4).\n4. The claim is FALSE since North Carolina produced only 2 champions between the specified year range.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzing table data, identifying years with NC state as a winner, verifying count of champions and evaluating the claim against that data.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winners\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"winners\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
