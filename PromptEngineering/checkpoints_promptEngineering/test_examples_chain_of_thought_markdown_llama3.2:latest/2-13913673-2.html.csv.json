    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim about the game against the Yankees on April 29 having the highest attendance at 41872 can be verified by looking at the table.\n2. To verify, we need to check if there is another row in the table with a higher attendance value than 41872 for any opponent other than the Yankees.\n3. We can start checking from the bottom of the table and move up.\n4. Looking at the attendance values for each game against the Mariners, Angels, Athletics, and Twins, we find that none of them have a higher attendance than 41872.\n5. Next, we check the attendance value for the other teams that were played before the Yankees, such as the White Sox, which is 41872 for one game and 17645 for another game, so this is not more than 41872 for both games.\n6. Now, let's look at the attendance values of the Yankees' opponents, starting from the bottom of the table: we see that the Royals had an attendance of 16165 and Twins had 34210 but Angels had an attendance of 37587; this is still not more than 41872.\n7. The next game to check would be the Athletics against their own team which had 16279, which is also lower than 41872.\n8. Continuing this process, we find that the attendance values for all opponents before the Yankees are either lower or equal to 41872.\n9. Since none of these have a higher attendance value than 41872 and the only other game against a Yankee has an attendance of 31467 which is also lower than 41872 , then this claim can be confirmed.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The table shows two games for this date:\n\n- Game 1: royals vs. red sox (postponed/rain) rescheduled for april 24\n- Game 2: royals vs. royals (postponed/rain) rescheduled for april 24\n\n### Step 3: Find the lowest scoring game on April 24\nWe need to check both games played on April 24, but since they are postponed and rescheduled for the same day, it's likely that only one actual game was played.\n\nThe table shows Game 2 (royals vs. royals) with a score of \"9 - 6\" and Game 1 (royals vs. red sox) with an empty score field, indicating that the game was postponed/rain and rescheduled for another date.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the lowest scoring game\nSince we can't verify the actual outcome of Game 1 due to its postponement and rescheduling, we focus on Game 2 (royals vs. royals). According to the table, this game had a score of \"2 - 0\".\n\nHowever, there's another game on April 24 that has not been accounted for yet: red sox vs. royal with the score \"6 - 4\".

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim states that there exists a 7 - 2 score against both the Mariner and the Yankee.\n\n#### Step 2: Find relevant scores for Mariners and Yankees\nTo verify the claim, we need to find rows in the table where the opponent is either the Mariners or the Yankees, and the score is exactly 7 - 2.\n\n#### Step 3: Locate relevant cells for Mariners\nFrom the table, we see that there is a cell (row_index = 29) with an opponent of \"mariners\" and a score of \"7 - 2\".\n\n```json\n{\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 29,\n            \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 29,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Locate relevant cells for Yankees\nThere is a cell (row_index = 25) with an opponent of \"yankees\" and a score of \"6 - 4\", which does not match the claim. However, there is another row (row_index = 26) where the opponent is indeed the Yankees and the score is \"4 - 3\".\n\n```json\n{\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 25,\n            \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 26,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Compare scores with claim\nSince there is a score of 7 - 2 for the Mariners, but not for the Yankees, we conclude that the original claim does indeed hold.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        \"Evaluate the claim about existing a 7 - 2 score against both Mariner and Yankee\",\n        \"Find relevant scores for Mariners and Yankees\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 29,\n            \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 29,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 26,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
