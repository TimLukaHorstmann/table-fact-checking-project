To confirm, let's list all possible rows where Hayate Usui could be involved.\n\n- res = 'win' or 'loss'\n- opponent contains 'Hayate Usui'\n\n### Step 3: Analyze rows for round 3\nEach row has columns for round and time. A defeat in round 3 should have both a non-zero round value and a specific time (e.g., 5:00, indicating the match went beyond the scheduled time).\n\n```markdown\n- Round 2 or more but not specified as less than 2.\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check relevant opponent matches for 'Hayate Usui'\nWe will manually check if any of the opponents in our search result are indeed listed under Hayate Usui.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze results based on our checks\nFrom the given data, there isn't clear evidence showing the specified round in which a single loss occurred. However, this step would ideally involve reviewing each relevant row to be certain that \"Hayate Usui\" is actually an opponent with only one loss and if so in round 3.\n\n### Step 6: Determine truth based on all facts\nTo fulfill the task we will make a final judgment after re-checking data:\n\n```markdown\nGiven table does not present definitive evidence regarding Hayate Usui's single loss in round 3 as required. \n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHere is our output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the target cell for comparison\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find relevant rows where opponent contains 'Hayate Usui'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze rows for round 3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check relevant opponent matches for 'Hayate Usui'\nWe did not find this information in the data provided.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine truth based on all facts\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to find out which tournaments are associated with a draw and also have a knockout (ko) in the table.\n\n2. **Find rows related to a KO in the Shooto tournament**: Since a KO is mentioned, we will focus on the Shooto tournaments where the ko occurred.\n\n3. **Identify relevant rows for the drawn match**: The claim specifically asks about a draw occurring in the same tournament as a ko. We need to find if there's any row that has \"draw\" and corresponds with a ko event.\n\n4. **Check for correlation between ko and draw events in the Shooto tournaments**: In the table, we can see which fights are in the Shooto tournament and if they have a ko or a draw.\n\n5. **List the specific rows related to both KO and Draw in the same event (Shooto)**:\n    - For \"ko\" we will look for all Shooto matches with TKO as method.\n    - For \"draw\", we'll find all matches labeled as a draw.\n\n\n6. **Analyze if any match occurred in the same tournament**: If any event has both a ko and a draw, then we can say that claim is true.\n\n7. **Check each match for relevance**:\n    - Shooto events have both draw and TKO methods.\n    - We will check if there's at least one common entry between draws (in the format of draw) and KO in the same event\n\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_claim(table_data):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function evaluates the claim regarding ko and drawn fights in the same tournament\n    \n  Args:\n        table_data (list): A list of dictionaries representing the table data.\n  \n  Returns:\n    json response with chain_of_thought, answer, relevant_cells\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Find rows related to a KO in Shooto tournaments\n  ko_rows = [row for row in table_data if row['method'] == 'tko (tko)']\n  \n  # Find rows related to draws\n  draw_rows = [row for row in table_data if row['record'][-1] == '-' and row['event'] == 'pip - east vs west']\n\n  # Check if any of the fights occurred in the same tournament\n  common_fights = []\n  ko_tournaments = set()\n  \n  # Extract tournaments from KO rows (only Shooto is mentioned)\n  for row in ko_rows:\n    if row['event'] == 'shooto':\n        ko_tournaments.add(row['tournament'])\n    \n  # Check if any draw occurred in the same tournament\n  for row in ko_rows:\n      if row['event'] == 'pip - east vs west':  # Only draw event is found here\n          common_fights.append({\n              \"row_index\": draw_rows.index(row),\n              \"column_name\" : 'record'\n            })\n\n  # Return answer as JSON format with chain_of_thought and relevant_cells\n  return {\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
