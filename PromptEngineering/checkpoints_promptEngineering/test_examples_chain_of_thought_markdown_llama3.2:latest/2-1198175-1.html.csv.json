We should look at the draft info.\n   - In the draft section of Aaron Kyle's table entry, we see he was drafted from Wyoming with a pick number 26 (p26) in round 1.\n   - Now that we know he was indeed drafted from Wyoming, this supports our initial claim about him attending Wyoming college.\n\n3.

To verify this claim, we need to check if any student in the table attended C.A. Technical High School and was drafted.\n3. We can start by checking the \"college\" column, which lists the college or university that each player attended.\n4. However, since the claim specifically mentions C.A. Technical High School, we should also look for a mention of this school in the \"born\" column, which lists the place and date of birth for each player.\n5. One notable row is David Boone, Jr., whose entry in the \"born\" column states \"October 30 , 1951 detroit , mi\", but it does not explicitly mention C.A. Technical High School.
