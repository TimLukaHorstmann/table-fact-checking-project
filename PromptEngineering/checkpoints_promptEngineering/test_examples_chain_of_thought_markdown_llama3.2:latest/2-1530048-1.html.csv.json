    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify what \"multi point fuel injection\" means from the table. It refers to a type of fuel system where fuel is injected at multiple points within the engine's cylinders.\n2. Next, we look for the specific model where this type of fuel system is used. According to the table, multi-point fuel injection is used in models with \"common rail direct injection\".\n3. Now, we need to find out what kind of valvetrain (engine design) these models use. The claim states that a fuel system with \"multi point fuel injection\" also has an \"sohc 8v\" valvetrain.\n4. We can see from the table that models with \"common rail direct injection\" use either \"sohc 16v\" or \"sohc 8v\" valvetrains, depending on the model. However, none of the models with \"common rail direct injection\" have an \"sohc 8v\" valvetrain.\n5. Based on steps 2-4, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"multi-point fuel injection\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"valvetrain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"valvetrain\"}\n  ]\n}",
