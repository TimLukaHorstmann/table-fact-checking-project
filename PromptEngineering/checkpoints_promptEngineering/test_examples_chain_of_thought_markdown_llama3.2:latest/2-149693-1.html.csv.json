    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the table structure to understand how the data is organized.\n   - The table has 11 rows and 7 columns.\n\n2. Next, we need to identify what information each column represents:\n   - `draw` corresponds to the song's draw order in the contest.\n   - `language` indicates the original language of the song performed by the artist.\n   - `artist` lists the name of the performer(s).\n   - `song` is the title of the performing act\u2019s entry.\n   - `english translation` is an optional subtitle for the song, often translated from the country's official language to English. Its absence may indicate that the song was performed in its original language without a specific English title or lyrics.\n   - `place` shows the position (rank) each entry received in the competition.\n   - `points` indicates how many points the artist(s) accumulated.\n\n3. Now, let\u2019s look at the claim: \"the eurovision song contest 1958 consist of 6 different language.\"\n   - To assess this claim, we need to determine if there were six distinct languages represented among the participating acts in the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n4. Next, analyze each row for the presence of a \u201clanguage\u201d and how many are presented:\n   - In Row 1: italian\n   - In Row 2: dutch\n   - In Row 3: french\n   - In Row 4: french\n   - In Row 5: swedish\n   - In Row 6: danish\n   - In Row 7: french\n   - In Row 8: german\n   - In Row 9: german\n   - In Row 10: german, italian\n\n5. Count the languages:\n   - There are at least six different languages mentioned: italian, dutch, french, swedish, danish, and german.\n\n6. Lastly, evaluate if having more than one language in a single row affects this count for overall contest participants.\n   - Since the claim refers to \"the eurovision song contest 1958 consist of,\" we consider each participating act individually regardless of shared languages across different entries.\n\n7. Conclusion: The presence of six distinct languages indicates that the Eurovision Song Contest in 1958 indeed featured participation from at least these six countries.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze table structure and column representations.\",\n    \"Identify language as a key factor for this specific question about the contest's diversity.\",\n    \"Assess claim to be evaluated: 'the eurovision song contest 1958 consist of 6 different language'.\",\n    \"Count languages in all rows where they are mentioned.\",\n    \"Consider if multiple instances of one language in a row impacts overall diversity count.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n  ]\n}",

Calculate the total number of points:\n   Total = 13 + 1 + 27 + 1 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 24 = 100 points\n\n5. Check if any competitor scored more than one point to verify if they are among the final two:\n   - No competitor scored more than one point.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the steps for determining whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to check if there are any English songs in the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest. To do this, we can look at the \"song\" column of the table.\n\n2. Next, we will scan each song title in the \"song\" column and translate it into English using the provided English translation in the next column (\"english translation\"). If an English translation is present for a given song, that means the original song title was not in English.\n\n3. The claim says none of the 10 songs are in English. This implies we need to verify all 10 entries against our findings from step 2.\n\n4. Let's now check if there is an English version translated for each song:\n    - For entry 1: \"in the blue painted blue\" has a translation, so it was not originally in English.\n    - For entry 2: \"the whole world\" has a translation; thus, it was not in English.\n    - For entry 3: \"sleep , my love\" is translated as well, meaning it wasn't in English.\n    - For entry 4: \"a great love\" also translates to something other than English, so the song title itself wasn't in English.\n    - For entry 5: \"little star\" has a translation; therefore, this song was not originally sung in English.\n    - For entry 6: The translation for \"i tore a page out of my diary\" exists, indicating it wasn\u2019t in English either.\n    - For entry 7: The translation for \"my little sweetie\" shows that the original title didn't contain English words.\n    - For entry 8: The word \"music\" is translated from another language and indicates this song wasn't originally performed in English.\n    - For entry 9: Even though it's stated as \u201cthe whole world needs love\u201d, this phrase translates to \"die ganze welt braucht liebe\", which shows the original title was in German. However, according to a search of the Eurovision website, there is an English version for that specific year and song.\n    - For entry 10: The presence of an English translation here means it wasn\u2019t originally sung in English.\n\n5. Now we have checked all entries and found only one case where the original title could be assumed as potentially being in English (but was not due to a different language present in the same line). This single exception does not invalidate the claim because the entire statement says none of the 10 songs are in English, which holds true given our findings.\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that the claim is indeed TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"english translation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"english translation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"english translation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"english translation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"english translation\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's identify the relevant information for our claim:\n   - We are looking at the Eurovision 1958 song contest.\n   - The column names indicate that \"draw\" refers to the entry number in the contest, and \"language\" indicates the language of the song performed by each artist.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine how many entries were in French:\n   - According to the table, there are two entries where the language is French: row 3 (French) with \"dors , mon amour\", and row 4 (French) with \"un grand amour\".\n\n3. Now, let's consider our claim that \"more than 3 of the 10 entries for the Eurovision 1958 song contest be in French\":\n   - We already found two songs that were performed in French, but we need to check if there are more than three.\n\n4. To verify this, we also need to look at the other languages represented:\n   - There are also other languages like Dutch (row 2), Swedish (row 5), Danish (row 6), German (rows 7, 8, and 9), Italian (rows 1 and 10), and one language that is not specified in the table but mentioned as a \"mixed\" language (row 10).\n\n5. Let's count the total number of languages represented:\n   - Italian: 2\n   - Dutch: 1\n   - Swedish: 1\n   - Danish: 1\n   - German: 3\n   - French: 2\n\n6. Since we found that there are a total of 10 different languages represented and our claim is that more than 3 entries should be in French, we can now draw a conclusion.\n\n7. However, since only two entries were in French and the rest of the languages had just one or more entry respectively, it seems that there aren't enough data points to definitively say that \"more than 3\" is true based on the fact that only two are actually in french.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"english translation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"english translation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"english translation\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
