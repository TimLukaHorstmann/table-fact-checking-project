    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. First, let's find the total disposals made by Ablett in 2005 and 2007 separately.\n\n   To do this, we'll look at the row for 2005 and 2007 in the table:\n   - For 2005: `disposals = 27 (6.8)`\n   - For 2007: `disposals = 191 (9.1)`\n\n2. Next, we'll calculate the total disposals made by Ablett from 2005 to 2007 by adding the disposals of 2005 and 2007.\n\n   So, `total_disposals_2005_to_2007 = 27 + 191 = 218`.\n\n3. Now, let's find the disposal count for 2008 and 2011. However, since we're only interested in data from 2005 to 2007, these values are irrelevant.\n\n4. Then, compare Ablett\u2019s total disposals between his record in 2005 and 2007 with what the claim states.\n\n   We know that `total_disposals_2005_to_2007` equals 218, while the claim states he has `164` more disposal between his record in 2005 and 2007. Since `218` is not equal to `164 + 218`, this means we need to calculate how many disposals were made by Ablett from 2006.\n\n   Looking at the row for 2006: `disposals = 56 (8.0)`. Adding these two numbers together will allow us to see whether Ablett had `164` more disposal between his record in 2005 and 2007:\n\n   `total_disposals_2005_to_2007 = 218`\n   `total_disposals_2006 = 56`\n\n   However, adding the disposals for 2005, 2006, and 2007 together does not equal 218 + 64. We now look at Ablett's disposal total between 2008 to present:\n\n   For 2011: `disposals = 22 (11.0)`\n\n   Now we need to know if Ablett had the disposals he was recorded for in the year of 2007 from the years that followed, since this is where his disposals went up.\n\n   Looking at the row for 2011: `disposals = 22 (11.0)`.\n\n   The disposal total between 2005 and 2007 equals 218. We must now look at how many of Ablett\u2019s disposals he was recorded to have in the years that followed his record from 2005-2007.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate total disposals made by Ablett in 2005 and 2007\",\n      \"disposals_2005\": \"27 (6.8)\",\n      \"disposals_2007\": \"191 (9.1)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Add disposals from 2005 and 2007 to get the total for this time period\",\n      \"total_disposals_2005_to_2007\": \"218\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare Ablett\u2019s total disposals between his record in 2005 and 2007 with what the claim states\",\n      \"claim_total\": \"164 (more than what he was recorded to have in 2007)\",\n      \"total_disposals_2005_to_2007\": \"218\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if Ablett\u2019s disposal total between 2008 to present makes up the difference for his disposals from 2006\",\n      \"disposals_2011\": \"22 (11.0)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total_disposals_2005_to_2007\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"disposals_2011\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We can do this by looking at the table and finding a row where the \"team\" is \"geelong\" and \"games\" is not -.\n2. According to the table, in 2005, 2006, and 2007, Nathan Ault played for Geelong. So we need to find out how many years he played before switching teams.\n3. We know that from season 2008 onwards, the data is missing. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that he left Geelong after season 2007. Therefore, we can assume that he might have played for Geelong in the seasons 2005 and 2006 and possibly some other seasons before that.\n4. To confirm our assumption, let's look at the \"career totals\" row in the table. This row provides information about Nathan Ault's career statistics when aggregated across all his seasons playing with different teams. Looking at this row, we see that he played a total of 34 games for Geelong. Since he played 21 games in season 2007 and 4 games in season 2005, it is clear that the remaining 9 games were spread across seasons before 2005.\n5.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's verify the claim by looking at Nathan Abbott's (not Ablett) best year for points with Geelong.\n2. We need to look at each season of his career with Geelong:\n   - 2005: 8 points\n   - 2006: 4 points\n   - 2007: 34 points\n   - 2011: 1 point\n3. Since we are comparing the claim \"across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Abbott's best year for points be 2008\" we should look at the 2008 data:\n   - 2008 is missing in both disposals and points but it doesn't impact our calculation of best year.\n4. We then compare 2007s 34 points to 2008's missing numbers and note that without 2008 numbers we can not make a final judgement. However, since it's stated \"across all his years with Geelong\", the statement is also referring to the career totals which are only available for 2008.\n5. Looking at the career total of points: 47 points in 34 games gives us an average of 1.4 points per game\n6. Looking at geelong's best year for points in general, we see that 2007 is their highest with 34 points\n7. But there's a key point, the career totals are referring to Nathan Abbott and they only give us his total number of games played.\n8. Since it was stated \"across all his years with Geelong\", without the disposals numbers we will refer to his career total for disposals instead.\n9. In the given data the disposals numbers for 2008 are missing, however looking at the rest of the table and comparing that with the averages we can find out how many disposals Nathan Abbott had played in his years of games before 2008 and then calculate the average amount of disposals per game.\n10. Using our career totals and knowing he played 34 total games across all seasons, we can safely assume the disposals are indeed below 296.\n11. Looking at a given season (without 2008 data) and with only one game played: geelong's average disposals per game is around 27.\n12. Comparing this to career totals of disposals for Nathan Abbott where his total disposals is below 296 we can make an educated assumption:\n    - The average disposals per game that Nathan Aabbott has, must be less than 8.7 given the 34 games figure.\n13. However our previous estimate (27) was with only 1 season and only one game so this may be a lower estimate of his career averages which is likely not true for all seasons.\n14. Taking into account that there are more games played in 2007 than both of the other non-2008 seasons we could assume that our estimate of the average disposals per game would also slightly decrease and should thus be even lower than 27, closer to 26-27\n15. But this is just an estimate. The actual value for a full season will depend on whether or not any of the other statistics in geelong's career totals are high compared to his disposals (we have no info on that).\n16. We also need to look at another statistic from career total: points per game which averages 1.4\n17. Now let's go back to season data and calculate what points average a full game Nathan Aabbott had in each of the seasons he played, starting with 2007:\n   - For 2007, we can safely assume this will be greater than 1.4 given that his average for all seasons was 1.4.\n18. For 2008: since we don't know how many games are played (even though we do have career totals) we cannot calculate the exact amount of points per game. We should therefore not assume it is higher or lower than geelong's career total for that statistic as well.\n19. Comparing season averages to career average:\n    - For disposals, since 2008 data is missing and his estimated career average was 8.7 we can safely say the season average must be less than that as it only contains one game\n    - For points: we have a clear indication that the 2007 points per game will be higher than the career total of 1.4 given he had 34 points in that single year.\n20. Lastly, comparing 2008's missing data to both disposals and points:\n    - It is safe to say his season average for points (being the only statistic we can calculate) must indeed be lower than 1.4 because there is no game played\n21. Now that we have calculated all of these statistics and know what they are, let's determine if the claim \"across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Abbott's best year for points be 2008\" is true:\n   - For disposals: it seems our estimate of career averages would make the season average less than that.\n   - However for points: we can safely say that 2007 must have a higher points per game than his career total which makes it likely to also be better than 2008\n22. Conclusion:\n   - Therefore, based on career totals and the calculations made above it is safe to say that:\n      \"across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Abbott's best year for point be 2008\" is FALSE because in season averages he most likely did better than 2008 which contains no games data\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 6,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 8,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 9,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 10,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 11,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 12,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 13,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 14,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 15,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 16,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 17,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 18,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 19,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 20,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 21,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"text\": \"FALSE\"\n}",
