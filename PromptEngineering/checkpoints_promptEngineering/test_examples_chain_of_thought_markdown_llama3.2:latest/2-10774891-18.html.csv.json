We find one row: \n| north melbourne | 10.20 (80)        | south melbourne | 17.11 (113)       | ... |\n\n#### Step 3: List Scores Less Than 10 Points for Away Team\nSimilarly, we need to list all rows where the \"away team score\" is less than 10.

The away team score for Carlton (9.8) is less than 10.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine Final Outcome\nSince we found that not all games have at least three scores less than 10 points on both teams but rather only one row of essendon and carlton fulfills this, the claim's requirement cannot be met by all.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Looking at the table, we can see that there are three venues with 'oval' in their names: \n   - Arden Street Oval\n   - Brunswick Street Oval\n   - Western Oval\n4. Now, we need to check if these venues played on themselves (i.e., the home team and away team were the same). If they did, then 2 venue be not play on venue with 'oval' in its name is TRUE.\n5. Checking each of the three venues: \n   - North Melbourne vs South Melbourne at Arden Street Oval\n   - Fitzyroy vs Geelong at Brunswick Street Oval (this match was played)\n   - Footscray vs Hawthorn at Western Oval (this match was played)\n\n6.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the venues with 'oval' in their names\nThe table contains two venues with 'oval' in their names: \n- Arden Street Oval \n- Western Oval \n- Brunswick Street Oval \n\nThese are the relevant cells as objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\":\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Check if there are any venue not playing on 'oval' venue\nLooking at the table, it can be seen that all games were played on venues with 'oval' in their names. There is no row of a game where 'venue' was 'not oval'. So we should verify this.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify if there are more than two venues not playing on venues with 'oval' in their name.\nThere is only one venue that does not have 'oval' in its name, which is 'mcg'. Since there are no other such venues and the question is about 'more than 2', we can conclude.\n\n#### Step 4: Draw a final conclusion\nSince there is only one venue ('mcg') without 'oval' in its name and the statement says more than two should not be playing on it, the claim must be false. \n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify venues with 'oval' in their names\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Verify that there are no venue playing on non-oval venue\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Check if more than two such venue exists\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Conclusion - since one does exist, claim must be false.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
