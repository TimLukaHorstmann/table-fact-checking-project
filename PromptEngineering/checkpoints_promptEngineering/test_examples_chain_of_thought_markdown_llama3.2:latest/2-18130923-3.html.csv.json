    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Players**: We need to find Bob Gilder's score and John Daly's scores to compare them.\n\n   - Look at row 5 for Bob Gilder's score: `73 + 70 + 67 + 73 = 283`\n   - Look at rows 1-4 for John Daly's scores: `69 + 67 + 69 + 71 = 276`\n\n2. **Compare Scores**: Now that we have both players' scores, compare them to see who scored higher.\n\n   - Bob Gilder scored 283\n   - John Daly scored 276\n\n3. **Determine the Correctness of the Claim**:\n\n   - Since 283 is greater than 276, Bob Gilder's score is indeed higher than John Daly's.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"Bob Gilder place higher than John Daly\" is TRUE.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells for Comparison**:\n\n   - For comparison purposes:\n     - Bob Gilder's row: `5`\n     - John Daly's rows: `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate the players to compare their scores\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare Bob Gilder's score with John Daly's scores\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the correctness of the claim\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
