This means we need to check if Whelan scored exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup.\n2. **Locate relevant cells**: Look for the row corresponding to Whelan and the column \"fa cup\" to see how many goals he scored in the FA Cup. Also, locate all rows where a player scored 3 goals in the FA Cup, regardless of their name.\n3. **Verify Whelan's score**: Check the value in the \"fa cup\" column for Whelan (row index 2). If it is 3, then Whelan indeed scored 3 goals in the FA Cup.\n4. **Check other players' scores**: Look at all rows where a player scored 3 goals in the FA Cup. If there are no such rows besides Whelan's, then he would be the only one to score 3 goals in the FA Cup. However, we also need to check if any of these other players actually exist in the table.\n5. **Verify existence of other players**: Look at each row where a player scored 3 goals in the FA Cup. Verify that all the names in those rows are present in the \"name\" column of the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (continued)\n\n6. **Whelan's score is indeed 3**: The value in the \"fa cup\" column for Whelan (row index 2) is 3, so this step confirms that Whelan scored exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup.\n7. **Verify existence of other players who scored 3 goals**: Check each row where a player scored 3 goals in the FA Cup.

Marinelli's total goals are indeed 2.\n\n### Step 8: Check Other Players' Totals\nWe will now check if there are other players with a total of 3 or more goals to see if the claim holds true for all these four players.\nIn the \"n\u00e9meth\" row, the value in the \"total\" column is 6. This confirms that N\u00e9meth scored 6 goals.\n\n### Step 9: Verify Other Players' Totals\nWe will now check if there are other players with a total of 3 or more goals to see if the claim holds true for all these four players.\nIn the \"ince\" row, the value in the \"total\" column is 3. This confirms that Ince scored 3 goals.\n\n### Step 10: Verify Other Players' Totals\nWe will now check if there are other players with a total of 2 or more goals to see if the claim holds true for all these four players.\nIn the \"cooper\" row, the value in the \"total\" column is indeed 2, confirming that Cooper scored exactly 2 goals.\n\n### Step 11: Verify Other Players' Totals\nWe will now check if there are other players with a total of 3 or more goals to see if the claim holds true for all these four players.\nNo other player has a total of 3 or more goals. \n\n### Step 12: Evaluate the Claim's Validity\nBased on our analysis, Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are indeed the only players who scored 2 or more goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze the claim\",\n      \"text\": \"The claim states that Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are the only players to score 2 or more goal\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant cells\",\n      \"text\": \"To verify the claim, we need to identify the cells in the table where the player scored 2 or more goals.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify Cooper's goals\",\n      \"text\": \"In the \\u201cqueudrue\\u201d row, the value in the \\u201ctotal\\u201d column is 2.
