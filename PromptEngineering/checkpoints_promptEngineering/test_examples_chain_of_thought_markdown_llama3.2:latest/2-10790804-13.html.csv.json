First, let's identify the row containing data for the Richmond vs Collingwood game.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n     }\n     ```\n2. Next, compare the crowd count of this game with that of other games in the table.\n   - We need to find the maximum crowd value among all rows.\n   - Let's identify the relevant cells for each row:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n     }\n     ```\n3. We can now compare these values:\n   - The Richmond vs Collingwood game has a crowd of 26000.\n   - Compare it with the other games in the table:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\",\n       \"value\": 8000\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\",\n       \"value\": 11000\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\",\n       \"value\": 16000\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"crowd\",\n       \"value\": 10000\n     }\n     ```\n   - It appears that the Richmond vs Collingwood game has the largest crowd.\n4.

We can see that both teams scored below 10 points.\n\nStep 3: Determine if any other team has a score less than 10 points for another game in the table, which would invalidate the claim.\n\nUpon inspecting further rows of the table, we find several instances where home or away scores are below 10:\n\n1. Essendon vs Carlton on August 1st, 1936 - Home score is 8.11 (59).\n2. Footscray vs Hawthorn on August 1st, 1936 - Away score is 8.21 (69), which does indeed put it under 10 points but we are looking for scores below 10 points.\n3. Fitzroy vs Melbourne on August 1st, 1936 - Home score is 13.13 (91) which is above 10 points\n4. Geelong vs North Melbourne on August 1st, 1936 - Home team's score was 122 points which is definitely over the threshold.\n5. South Melbourne vs St Kilda on August 1st, 1936 - The home score of 14.19 (103) is also above 10 points.\n\nHowever, we do find two other teams with scores below 10:\n\n1.

This requires looking at the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns in the table.\n\n3. **Check scores for each team**:\n   - For geelong, home team score is 122, which is above 10 points.\n   - For fitzroy, home team score is 91, which is below 10 points.\n   - For south melbourne, home team score is 103, which is above 10 points.\n   - For hawthorn, home team score is 91, which is below 10 points.\n   - For richmond, home team score is 80, which is below 10 points.\n\n4. **Determine the outcome**: Based on step 3, we find at least two teams (fitzroy and hawthorn) whose scores are below 10 points.
