There are no apparent errors or discrepancies that could lead us astray from our claim.\n\n4. **Identify other high-scoring players and their respective earnings**:\n   - After comparing mark brooks' score with others, we identify other players like kenny perry, steve elkington, tommy tolles, justin leonard, jesper parnevik, vijay singh, per-ulrik johansson, phil mickelson, larry mize, frank nobilo, and nick price who also scored the same as mark brooks. We need to see if any of these players have a higher money value.\n\n5. **Check if mark brooks' earnings are the highest among all high-scoring players**:\n   - All of them have 430000 dollars which is more than what other players like kenny perry, steve elkington, tommy tolles, justin leonard, jesper parnevik, vijay singh, per-ulrik johansson, phil mickelson, larry mize, frank nobilo, and nick price have.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since no player has more money than mark brooks (who earned 430000 dollars), we can confidently say that the claim is true.\n\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Mark Brooks' total score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"His corresponding money value in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Verification of accurate scores and winnings amounts\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"money\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"money\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

We know that Kenny Perry's score was 277 and he earned $260000. To find his average score, we divide his total score by the number of rounds played (4). This gives us an average score of 277/4 = 69.25.\n3. Similarly, Mark Brooks' average score is 277/4 = 69.25.\n4. Since their average scores are the same, we can't directly compare their earnings based on this information alone. We need to look at the total amounts earned by each player and see if Kenny Perry earned $170000 less than Mark Brooks.\n5. According to the table, Mark Brooks earned $430000, while Kenny Perry earned $260000. To determine if Kenny Perry earned $170000 less, we can subtract his earnings from Mark Brooks' earnings: $430000 - $260000 = $170000.\n6.
