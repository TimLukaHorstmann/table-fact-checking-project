    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the relevant cell for attendance on April 19: Look at the attendance column for the game played on April 19 against the Rangers.\n2. Determine if there's a higher attended game before that: Compare the attendance value in the identified cell (April 19) with all other values in the attendance column.\n3. Identify the relevant cells for games played before April 19: Look at all cells in the attendance column where the date is earlier than April 19.\n\nLet's perform step-by-step analysis based on these steps:\n\nStep 1:\nWe will check if there is any game with a higher attendance value before April 19.\n\nLooking at each cell in the \"attendance\" column, we find that for April 19:\n- row_index: 20\n- column_name: attendance\n- attendance: 44206\n\nComparing this attendance value to all other values:\n\n* For row_index = 1 and column_name = attendance, we have attendance: 31310 which is less than 44206.\n* For row_index = 2 and column_name = attendance, we have attendance: 25642 which is also less than 44206.\n* For row_index = 3 and column_name = attendance, we have attendance: 25582 which is less than 44206.\n* For row_index = 4 and column_name = attendance, we have attendance: 29106 which is also less than 44206.\n* For row_index = 9 and column_name = attendance, we have attendance: 746 which is the lowest among all values.\n\nStep 2:\nBased on step 1, there are no games with higher attended values before April 19. Since we've checked that there isn't any game with a higher attended value than April 19, our next step is to check if the attendance at April 19 is indeed the highest among all games in the table.\n\nStep 3:\nWe don't need to do this since we have already identified the highest attendance on April 19. We will verify that it is the highest by comparing it with the attendance of other dates.\n\n\nBased on these steps, our conclusion can be determined as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"look at all cells in attendance column where row_index < 20\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"compare each value to 44206 and determine if any of them are greater\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"if none are greater, then 44206 is the highest attended value.

We have to look at every game.\n\n2. **Analyze Score Formats**: Next, we need to check if any row that was initially thought to not be a shutout might actually be one due to a scoring format other than the standard score.\n   - Reviewing each row in detail, we find no additional rows where the format is ambiguous enough to conclude it's a shutout.\n\n3. **Count Shutouts**: Given our analysis, count how many game end in a clear shutout (either 0-0 or one team has more runs than the other with no scores).\n\n4. **Compare Count to Claim**: Finally, we compare this count to the claim that \"4 of the games ended in a shut out\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n1. **Identify Shutouts**:\n   - Looking through every row again for clear shutouts: `april 9 | white sox  | 5 - 0                                              | \u00e1lvarez (0 - 2)                                    | 746                                                | 3 - 3                                             ` indicates a shutout.\n   - Upon detailed review, there are only two games with scores clearly indicating a shutout.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n2. **Analyze Score Formats**:\n   - Further analysis shows that while there might be ambiguous score formats in other rows, none of them meet the criteria for being considered a clear shutout.\n\n3. **Count Shutouts**:\n   - After identifying all potential shutouts and reviewing the table, we find exactly two clear shutouts: `april 9` and `april 20`.\n\n4. **Compare Count to Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"4 of the games ended in a shut out\".

We will examine each row in the table and determine which rows represent a game ending in a shutout.\n\n### Relevant Rows:\n\n| Row Index | Column Name        |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| 0         | score              |\n| 1         | score              |\n| 2         | score              |\n| 3         | score              |\n| 4         | score              |\n| 5         | score              |\n| 9         | score              |\n| 10        | score              |\n| 13        | score              |\n| 22        | score              |\n| 23        | score              |\n| 26        | score              |\n\nThese rows represent games that may have ended in a shutout. However, to confirm, we must look at the \"loss\" column for any indication of no opposing team scoring.\n\n### Relevant Losses:\n\n| Row Index | Column Name          | Value    |\n|-----------|-----------------------|----------|\n| 0         | loss                 | plesac (0 - 1) |\n| 2         | loss                 | \u00e1lvarez (0 - 1) |\n| 9         | loss                 | \u00e1lvarez (0 - 2) |\n| 13        | loss                 | spoljaric (0 - 1) |\n| 22        | loss                 | james (1 - 2) |\n| 23        | loss                 | spoljaric (0 - 2) |\n| 26        | loss                 | lowe (0 - 1) |\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the \"loss\" column, games 0, 2, and 9 did not have an opposing team score. Games 13, 22, and 23 also had losses indicating no opposing team scored, but only these three are a true shutout.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Games 0, 2, 9, 13, 22, and 23 represent games that ended in a shutout. Game 26 represents a shutout as well after reviewing the relevant loss.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. The claim mentions a game against the White Sox, so we need to find the attendance for that game.\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there are two games listed against the White Sox on April 1 and April 8. However, since April 8 is postponed due to cold weather and rescheduled for August 19, we will not consider its attendance.\n3. We need to find a game with less than 500 attendees among all games in the table, excluding those against the White Sox that have been postponed or rescheduled.\n4. Looking at the table, we see that there is one game with an attendance of 40299 for the April 1 game against the White Sox. This exceeds the threshold of 500.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there is no game in the table with less than 500 attendees among those that have not been postponed or rescheduled, the claim is False.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
