    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant data\nThe claim is about whether Courtney Walsh was the home captain for half of the match. To determine this, we need to examine the table to see how many times Courtney Walsh was listed as the home captain and how many matches were played.\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of home captains in each row\nFor each date, check if there is a match where Courtney Walsh was both the home captain and the away captain. If so, it means he was the home captain for that match.\n\n### Step 3: Check the table data\nExamine the table to find rows where Courtney Walsh was listed as both the home captain and the away captain:\n\n| date                                       | home captain   | away captain   | venue                    | result               |\n|:-------------------------------------------|:---------------|:---------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------|\n| 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 november 1996       | mark taylor    | courtney walsh | brisbane cricket ground  | aus by 123 runs      |\n| 29 , 30 november , 1 , 2 , 3 december 1996 | mark taylor    | courtney walsh | sydney cricket ground    | aus by 124 runs      |\n| 26 , 27 , 28 december 1996                 | mark taylor    | courtney walsh | melbourne cricket ground | wi by 6 wkts         |\n| 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 january 1997             | mark taylor    | courtney walsh | adelaide oval            | aus by inns&183 runs |\n| 1 , 2 , 3 february 1997                    | mark taylor    | courtney walsh | waca ground              | wi by 10 wkts        |\n\nWe can see that Courtney Walsh was listed as both the home captain and the away captain for all matches except one. That match is from 26, 27 , 28 december 1996 where he is only mentioned as a home captain.\n\n### Step 4: Count the total number of matches\nThere are 5 matches in the table.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate if Courtney Walsh was home captain for half of the matches\nIf there were an equal number of times Courtney Walsh was home captain and away captain, then he would be home captain for half of the matches. Given that this is not true as he is not mentioned as both home and away for any match other than one where he is only a home captain.\n\n### Step 6: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nSince Courtney Walsh was not listed as home captain and away captain in all matches, the claim that \"courtney walsh be the home captain for half of the match\" is false.\n\n### Step 7: List relevant cells:\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\":1,\n        \"column_name\":\"home captain\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\":2,\n        \"column_name\":\"away captain\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\":3,\n        \"column_name\":\"home captain\"\n    }\n]\n\n### Step 8: Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Step 1: Identify the relevant data\", \"Step 2: Count the number of home captains in each row\", \"Step 3: Check the table data\", \"Step 4: Count the total number of matches\", \"Step 5: Calculate if Courtney Walsh was home captain for half of the matches\", \"Step 6: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n        \"row_index\":1,\n        \"column_name\":\"home captain\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\":2,\n        \"column_name\":\"away captain\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\":3,\n        \"column_name\":\"home captain\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
