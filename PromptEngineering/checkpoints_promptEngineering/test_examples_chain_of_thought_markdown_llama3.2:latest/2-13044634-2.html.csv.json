    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the claim\nThe claim states that a \"3 game be play in hammond , in\". This seems to be a typo or misinterpretation, as it appears to be asking if there will be a 3-game match in Hammond, Indiana.\n\n### Step 2: Checking the table for relevant information\nLooking at the table, we can see that there are indeed matches scheduled to take place in Hammond, Indiana. The first row shows a win against Cliff Wright with a technical decision (unanimous) and a location of \"Hammond , indiana , united states\".\n\n### Step 3: Checking round and game number\nHowever, the claim seems to be referring to a specific type of match (\"3 game\") rather than the actual number of rounds or games in each match. Looking at the table, we can see that the first match is indeed a win against Cliff Wright with a technical decision (unanimous), but it does not specify the number of rounds or games.\n\n### Step 4: Checking for matches with a \"3 game\" notation\nUpon closer inspection, there is no row in the table that explicitly mentions a \"3 game\" notation. The locations and opponents match are clearly listed, but there is no indication of the exact format of the match (e.g., 3-game series, etc.).\n\n### Step 5: Drawing a conclusion\nBased on the information provided in the table, we cannot confirm whether the claim about a \"3 game be play in hammond , in\" is true or false. The table only lists individual matches with their respective locations and opponents, but does not provide any additional context or notation regarding the number of rounds or games.\n\n### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Claim: '3 game be play in hammond , in'\",\n    \"Step 1: Understand claim\",\n    \"Step 2: Check table for relevant information\",\n    \"Step 3: Check round and game number\",\n    \"Step 4: Check for matches with a '3 game' notation\",\n    \"Conclusion: Cannot confirm claim due to lack of context\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\" }\n  ]\n}",

The only question now is whether Jonatas Novaes has another win in the table with a unanimous decision, which we can find by looking at the row for Jonatas Novaes' opponent Cliff Wright.\n\n5. **Check the method of Jonatas Novaes' opponent's win against Cliff Wright**: In the row for Jonatas Novaes' opponent, Cliff Wright won by technical decision (unanimous). \n\n6. **Determine if both games are decided unanimously and verify if one of them was between Jonatas Novaes:** Both decisions were unanimous but in different opponents.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided information, there is no direct relationship that can confirm a second unanimous game won by Jonatas Novaes against another opponent.

This indicates that there might not be a total of three fights against him.\n\n### Step 4: Determining Round Length of Each Fight Against Cliff Wright\nFor each fight against Cliff Wright, we check if the round length was indeed 3 rounds long:\n- In the row where `opponent` is 'cliff wright', the row_index is 1. Looking at this specific table entry in more detail, we see that the \"round\" column indicates a total of three rounds: `|       3 |`. This matches our claim.\n\n### Step 5: Drawing Conclusion\nGiven that there was indeed one fight against Cliff Wright which lasted for 3 rounds, and considering there's only one relevant row (entry) in the table concerning Cliff Wright, it suggests that this is the only or possibly the total number of three-round fights involving Cliff Wright. \n\nHowever, to fully determine if \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round\" without assuming more information than provided, we consider the structure of the question: it asks if there was one out of a possible set of three fights which were 3 rounds long.\n\n### Step 6: Making Final Determination\nGiven the table only shows one entry against Cliff Wright and it is indeed a 3-round fight, but considering the phrasing of the claim, we cannot assert the truth of the claim without assuming there are other relevant data points that would tell us if this was one of three such fights.
