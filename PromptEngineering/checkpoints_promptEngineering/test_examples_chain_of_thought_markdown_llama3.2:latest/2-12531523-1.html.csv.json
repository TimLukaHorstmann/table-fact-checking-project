    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim to be verified**: The claim states that Tiger Woods has won the most times out of all players in the Master Tournament.\n2. **Look at relevant data**:\n   - In the table, we find the names of players and their respective years they won the tournament along with some other statistics such as total strokes taken, the difference between total strokes and par, and their finish position.\n3. **Count the wins for Tiger Woods**: From the given table, we see that Tiger Woods has won in 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005. This means he has won at least 4 times.\n4. **Compare with other players**: Now, we need to compare this number of wins with the number of wins for other players. From the table:\n   - Phil Mickelson has won in 2004 and 2006, making it 2 wins.\n   - Vijay Singh won in 2000 but no additional years are shown, so that's at least one win.\n   - Mike Weir won once in 2003.\n   - Zach Johnson won once in 2007.\n5. **Identify the player with the most wins**: Since Tiger Woods has a higher number of wins (4) compared to any other player whose wins are shown in the table, we can infer that he indeed won more times than other players mentioned.\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the data provided and the comparison made, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Identify the claim to be verified\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Look at relevant data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Count the wins for Tiger Woods\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Compare with other players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Identify the player with the most wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

These are tiger woods, phil mickelson, zach johnson.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of players who won in the years specified\nNow we count the total number of wins for these players:\n- Tiger Woods has 4 wins (in 1997 , 2001 , 2002 , and 2005)\n- Phil Mickelson has 2 wins (in 2004 and 2006)\n- Zach Johnson has 1 win (in 2007)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the total number of United States players who have won\nWe now calculate the total number of players from the United States who have won:\nTiger Woods = 1 (already a multiple winner) + Phil Mickelson = 2 wins, Zach Johnson = 1 win.\n\nSo, in total, there are only 4 players who won for the united states.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, we need to determine how many times each player has won.\n\n2. From the table, Phil Mickelson has 2 wins (2004 , 2006) and Zach Johnson also has 1 win (2007).\n\n3. However, according to the claim, it is stated that \"phil mickelson have 4 more win than zach johnson do\". To check if this statement is true or false, we need to see if Phil Mickelson won 4 times more than Zach Johnson.\n\n4. Since both players are from United States and have a limited number of wins (2 for Mickelson and 1 for Johnson), the only way that Phil could have won \"4 more\" than Zach is if Zach had zero or less than four wins, which isn't possible since he already has one win. However, this step will check whether it's true that phil mickelson won four times more than zack johnson by simply comparing the number of wins.\n\n5. Comparing the total number of wins of Phil Mickelson (2) and Zach Johnson (1), we see that Phil Mickelson did not have 4 more wins. \n\n6. The comparison in step 5 concludes our reasoning process because it directly answers whether the claim is true or false by comparing Phil Mickelson's total wins with Zach Johnson's.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Determine how many times each player has won.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: From the table, Phil Mickelson has 2 wins (2004 , 2006) and Zach Johnson also has 1 win (2007).\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: According to the claim, it is stated that \\\"phil mickelson have 4 more win than zach johnson do\\\".\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Since both players are from United States and have a limited number of wins (2 for Mickelson and 1 for Johnson), the only way that Phil could have won \\\"4 more\\\" than Zach is if Zach had zero or less than four wins, which isn't possible since he already has one win.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"5: Comparing the total number of wins of Phil Mickelson (2) and Zach Johnson (1), we see that Phil Mickelson did not have 4 more wins.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Review the table to understand which columns contain relevant information for the claim:\n   - The claim mentions \"the united state\" as a condition, so we need to look at the \"country\" column.\n   - We also need to check the \"year (s) won\" column to see how many players from the United States have won.\n\n2. Identify rows where \"country\" equals \"united states\":\n   The relevant row indices are 0 and 1, corresponding to tiger woods and phil mickelson respectively.\n\n3. For each of these rows, extract the number of years won:\n   - Tiger Woods: 4\n   - Phil Mickelson: 2\n\n4. Check if there are at least two players from the United States who have won the Master Tournament:\n   Since both tiger woods and phil mickelson have won, this condition is met.\n\n5.

The exact number of wins and his scores need to be checked.\n\n- Check the \"year (s) won\" column for any other years besides \"2003\". If there are no other years listed, then this is potentially true.\n- For each winning year in the \"year (s) won\" column:\n  - Check the \"to par\" value. Since Mike Weir's score is positive (+2 or +3), it means he was under par on at least one of his wins.\n\n### Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation\nIf Mike Weir has only one win and that win was under par, then the claim could be true. However, if he has more than one win with positive scores, the claim is false because it states \"only 1 Master tournament\".\n\n### Step 5: Finalize reasoning\n- Mike Weir's \"year (s) won\" includes two values (\"2003\" and no other specified years), indicating more than one win.\n- Both of his wins had positive scores in the \"to par\" column, meaning he was under par both times.\n\nGiven this information, Mike Weir has not only won one but at least two Master tournaments, with both being under par.\n\n### Step 6: Formulate answer\nBased on our steps and conclusion, the claim that \"Mike Weir only won 1 Master tournament under par\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step_number\": 1, \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\"},\n    {\"step_number\": 2, \"description\": \"Locate relevant information in the table for Mike Weir\"},\n    {\"step_number\": 3, \"description\": \"Evaluate the claim based on winning years and scores\"},\n    {\"step_number\": 4, \"description\": \"Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Now, we can see that Sandy Lyle's final score is `+14` above par.\n   \n   - Since a par score of 72 is assumed (not explicitly stated in the table), we subtract 14 from 72 to get under par score: `72 - 14 = 58`.\n   \n   - Now, let's calculate Vijay Singh's under score by doing the same:\n     ```\n     289 \n     = 289 - 58 (assuming a standard of 72 as a baseline for calculation)\n     = 231\n     ```\n\n3. Next, we compare these two values to see if Vijay Singh's final score is less than Sandy Lyle's.\n   - `231` is greater than `58`.\n   \n4.
