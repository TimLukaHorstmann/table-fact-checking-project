Since this is exactly what the claim states should happen and we know there are indeed 6 countries with only one Miss World title from our previous steps, it confirms that our list of valid countries includes them.\nSince Venezuela does not meet this criteria, Venezuela will be excluded.\n\nStep 6: Summarize all countries found to have only one Miss World title, and verify the claim is TRUE for those.\nCountries verified so far are United Kingdom, India, Jamaica, South Africa. All these countries appear exactly once in their \"miss world\" category, meeting our criteria.\n\nStep 7: Determine if any additional information needs to be considered before providing a final answer based on our findings.\nWe have identified all relevant rows that meet the claim\u2019s requirement and verified that they indeed only have one Miss World title. No further action is needed.\n\nStep 8: Construct the output in JSON format with step-by-step reasoning, final answer, and list of relevant cells.\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        \"The claim states there should be 6 countries with a total of 1 Miss World title each.\",\n        \"We identified Venezuela as one of these countries but it does not meet the criteria since its count for miss world is 6, meaning more than one Miss World title.\",\n        \"However, we also verified that other countries - United Kingdom, India, Jamaica, and South Africa - only have a single Miss World title in their respective rows, which meets our initial requirement.\",\n        \"We further checked if these countries appear exactly once in their 'miss world' category, verifying the claim's statement.\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states there should be 6 countries with a total of 1 Miss World title each.\",\n    \"We identified Venezuela as one of these countries but it does not meet the criteria since its count for miss world is 6, meaning more than one Miss World title.\",\n    \"However, we also verified that other countries - United Kingdom, India, Jamaica, and South Africa - only have a single Miss World title in their respective rows, which meets our initial requirement.\",\n    \"We further checked if these countries appear exactly once in their 'miss world' category, verifying the claim's statement.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"miss world\"}\n  ]\n}",
