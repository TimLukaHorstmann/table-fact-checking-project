    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process for determining whether the claim about Sherdrick Bonner's yardage in 1998 is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. The first step is to identify the relevant data points for comparing Sherdrick Bonner's yardage in 1998 and 2000. This can be done by looking at the table and finding the rows that correspond to these two years.\n\n2. According to the table, Sherdrick Bonner played a total of 451 yards in 1998. To find this value, we look at the row for 1998: | year              |   comp |   att |   comp% |   yards |   td 's |   int 's |   rating | . So the relevant cell for 1998 is { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"yards\" } with value 3571.\n\n3. Similarly, to find Sherdrick Bonner's yardage in 2000, we look at the row for 2000: | year              |   comp |   att |   comp% |   yards |   td 's |   int 's |   rating | . So the relevant cell for 2000 is { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"yards\" } with value 3454.\n\n4. Now we compare these two values to determine if Sherdrick Bonner indeed had 117 more yards in 1998 than in 2000. This comparison can be done by calculating the difference between the yardage in 1998 and 2000: 3571 - 3454 = 117.\n\n5. Since 117 is equal to the difference we calculated, this confirms that Sherdrick Bonner indeed had 117 more yards in 1998 than in 2000.\n\n6. With all relevant data points considered, we can confidently conclude that the claim about Sherdrick Bonner's yardage in 1998 is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant data points for comparing Sherdrick Bonner's yardage in 1998 and 2000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Find the value of yards for 1998\",\n      \"cell_value\": { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"yards\" }, \n      \"value\": 3571\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find the value of yards for 2000\",\n      \"cell_value\": { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"yards\" }, \n      \"value\": 3454\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare yardage values to confirm the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate difference between yardage values\",\n      \"calculation\": 3571 - 3454 = 117\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion: The claim is TRUE based on comparison\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"yards\" }, \n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"yards\" } \n  ]\n}",

We can find the number of completions for each year by looking at the \"comp\" column in the table. Specifically, we need to look at the rows for 2004 and 2007.\n3. For 2004, Sherdrick had 348 completions (as shown in row #4).\n4. For 2007, Sherdrick had 315 completions (as shown in row #16).\n5. Now we can subtract the number of completions for 2007 from the number of completions for 2004 to see if it matches the claim: 348 - 315 = 33.\n6.
