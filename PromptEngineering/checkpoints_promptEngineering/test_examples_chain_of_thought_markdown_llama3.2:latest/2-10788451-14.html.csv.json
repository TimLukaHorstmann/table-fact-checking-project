This confirms that Melbourne was indeed playing as an away team.\n3. **Confirm date and venue**: The table specifies the date as 31 july 1965 and the venue as Mcg. Since Mcg is a well-known sports stadium located in Melbourne, it's reasonable to assume that Melbourne played at this location.\n4. **Eliminate any other possibilities**: We have only one game listed for Melbourne in the table, which takes place on 31 july 1965.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on these steps, we can confidently conclude that Melbourne did indeed play as an away team on 31 july 1965.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",
