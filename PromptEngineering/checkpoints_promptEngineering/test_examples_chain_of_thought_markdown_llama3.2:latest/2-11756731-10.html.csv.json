First, we need to check the attendance on April 10 and April 12:\n   - On April 10, the attendance is given as 20066.\n   - On April 12, the attendance is also given as 20066.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine if Nashville was the visitor team against Detroit both days:\n   - For April 10, according to the table, Nashville was indeed the visitor team.\n   - For April 12, according to the table, Nashville was again the visitor team.\n\n3. Since the attendance on both dates is the same (20066) and Nashville was the visitor team both times against Detroit, this part of the claim appears to be true.\n\n4. However, we also need to check if there's any indication that the series outcome might affect the claim:\n   - On April 10, the series was 0-1.\n   - On April 12, the series was 0-2.\n   - The attendance and visitor team information for both dates do not seem to depend on the series outcome.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the provided table data, it appears that the claim is true because Nashville's attendance in both instances matches the visitor status against Detroit.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"check attendance on April 10 and April 12\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"confirm Nashville was the visitor team against Detroit both days\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"check for any implications of series outcome on attendance data\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"determine if the claim is true based on the information found so far\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the games between April 10 and April 20. These games are:\n- Game 1: April 10\n- Game 2: April 12\n- Game 3: April 14\n- Game 4: April 16\n- Game 5: April 18\n- Game 6: April 20\n\n2. Next, we need to check the attendance for each game and see if it is within the range specified in the claim (never more than 21000 or less than 17000). We will list all attendance values below:\n\n* Game 1: 20066\n* Game 2: 20066\n* Game 3: 17113\n* Game 4: 17113\n* Game 5: 20066\n* Game 6: 17113\n\n3. Now, we will analyze the attendance values to see if they meet the claim conditions:\n- For Game 1 and Game 2, attendance is equal to 20066 which lies outside of the specified range because it exceeds both lower bound(17000) and higher bound (21000).\n- For Game 3, attendance is less than 17000.\n- For Game 4, attendance is also less than 17000.\n- For Game 5, attendance equals to 20066 which again lies outside of the specified range for similar reasons as mentioned above.\n- For Game 6, attendance is less than 17000.\n\nBased on this analysis, it can be seen that there are games where attendance value falls outside of specified bounds.\n\n\n\nHere's a final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

For instance, on April 10, the score in a home game (detroit) does not include 'decision', which indicates that our assumption may be false.\n- Step 4: Investigating away games shows the same issue; the presence or absence of 'decision' doesn't align with the claim when either team is at home or away. This eliminates our initial confidence in the truth of our hypothesis, leading us to conclude the answer must be \"FALSE\".\n- The relevant cells highlighted are where we found discrepancies that support our conclusion: Row 0 for nashville being home (in this instance detroit was the 'visitor'), row 1 shows 'decision' isn't present when nashville is at home and detroit is away, and row 2 highlights another scenario where 'decision' isn't included during a game in which nashville is the 'home' team.",

Extract relevant information from the table for the claim \"isaac have the decision in every game when detroit be home or nashville be home\":\n   - We need to check if Isaac's name appears as the 'visitor' in games where either Detroit is home (i.e., `home` column equals 'Detroit') or Nashville is home (i.e., `home` column equals 'Nashville').\n   - For each game, we also need to verify that Isaac has the decision ('ellis' in the `decision` column) when either Detroit is home or Nashville is home.\n\n3. Analyze the games:\n   - In Game 1 (April 10), Isaac's name appears as the 'visitor', but the home team is Detroit, and the decision does not mention 'isaac'. So this game does not support the claim.\n   - In Game 2 (April 12), again, Isaac's name appears as the 'visitor' with the home team being Detroit, and the decision also does not mention 'isaac'. Thus, it doesn't fit our criteria.\n   - In Game 3 (April 14), Isaac is on the visiting team but when Nashville is at home. The decision for this game mentions \"ellis\", which implies that Isaac's name might be in reference to the decision maker rather than a player named Isaac being involved directly with the match, so it does not support our claim.\n   - In Game 4 (April 16), Isaac's team is on the visiting side again but Detroit is at home. The decision for this game also mentions \"ellis\", which suggests the same interpretation as before and thus doesn't fit our criteria.\n   - In Game 5 (April 18), Isaac's name appears as the 'visitor' with Nashville being the home team, and once more, the decision does not mention 'isaac'. So it does not support the claim.\n   - In Game 6 (April 20), Isaac is on the visiting side with Detroit at home, but again the decision doesn't specifically mention 'isaac'.

Conclusion:\n   Given that in every scenario where Isaac's team is home or visiting and he has a decision to be made as indicated by \"ellis\" (presumably a placeholder for a person's name but interpreted here as the decision maker), the claim remains unfulfilled since 'isaac' himself is not mentioned in those scenarios.\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Check the Series Record\nThe claim mentions a specific series record: \"2 - 4\". To verify if Nashville was at home, we need to check their overall record against Detroit during the entire series.\n\n```markdown\n| date     | visitor   | score   | home      | decision   |   attendance | series   |\n|:---------|:----------|:--------|:----------|:-----------|-------------:|:---------|\n| april 10 | nashville | 1 - 3   | detroit   | ellis      |        20066 | 0 - 1    |\n| april 12 | nashville | 2 - 4   | detroit   | ellis      |        20066 | 0 - 2    |\n| april 14 | detroit   | 3 - 5   | nashville | ellis      |        17113 | 1 - 2    |\n| april 16 | detroit   | 2 - 3   | nashville | ellis      |        17113 | 2 - 2    |\n| april 18 | nashville | 2 - 1   | detroit   | ellis      |        20066 | 2 - 3    |\n| april 20 | detroit   | 3 - 0   | nashville | ellis      |        17113 | 2 - 4    |\n```\n\nWe can see that the final series record is indeed \"2 - 4\" and that Nashville was away in all games.\n\n### Step 2: Check if the Score is 3 - 2\nThe claim also mentions a specific score: \"3 - 2\". We need to check if this score occurred during the last game of the series, which Nashville won.\n\n```markdown\n| date     | visitor   | score   | home      | decision   |   attendance | series   |\n|:---------|:----------|:--------|:----------|:-----------|-------------:|:---------|\n| april 18 | nashville | 2 - 1   | detroit   | ellis      |        20066 | 2 - 3    |\n| april 20 | detroit   | 3 - 0   | nashville | ellis      |        17113 | 2 - 4    |\n```\n\nWe can see that the score \"3 - 2\" did not occur in the last game of the series.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nSince the series record was indeed \"2 - 4\", but the final score was not \"3 - 2\", we need to re-examine if there is any possible way the claim could be true.\n\nHowever, after reviewing all the information provided by the table, it appears that this specific claim cannot be verified as true based on the data presented.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the Series Record\",\n      \"description\": \"The series record is indeed 2 - 4\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if the Score is 3 - 2\",\n      \"description\": \"However, the final score in the last game was 0 - 3, not 3 - 2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that \"the series go to 2 - 0 on april 16 when the attendance 17113 and detroit be the visiting team\". This implies we need to check if the Detroit team was the visiting team on April 16, and if so, if the score was 2-3.\n\n2. **Locate relevant cells**: From the table, we can see that on April 16:\n   - The row index is `4` (starting from 0).\n   - The column name for \"date\" is in the first cell of this row (`| april 16 |`).\n   - The column name for \"attendance\" is at row index 3, column name is '20066' but we need to get the data for column '17113' and thus look in the row where attendance is given as `17113`, which is also on April 16 (as mentioned in cell '| april 16 |`).\n   - The column name for \"visitor\" will tell us who visited.\n   - The decision and series columns are not relevant for this claim.\n\n3. **Extract data**: Looking at row index 4 we find:\n   - Date is `april 16`\n   - Visitor is `nashville`\n   - Score is `2-3` (relevant here)\n   - Home team is `detroit`, which means Detroit was the visiting team on April 16, as required.\n   - Attendance is indeed `17113`.\n   - The series result is not needed for this specific claim.\n\n4. **Verify claim**: With all data verified:\n   - On April 16, Detroit was indeed the visiting team (as \"home\" indicates).\n   - The score on that date was `2-3`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since both conditions of the claim are met (Detroit being the visiting team and the score being `2-3`), we conclude that the series did go to 2-0 on April 16 under these circumstances.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant cells based on claim\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\n          \"column_name\": \"date\",\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"value\": \"april 16\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"column_name\": \"attendance\",\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"value\": \"17113\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract data for verification\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\n          \"column_name\": \"visitor\",\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"value\": \"nashville\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"column_name\": \"score\",\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"value\": \"2-3\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify claim with extracted data\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\n          \"claim_condition_1\": \"Detroit was the visiting team on April 16\",\n          \"data_value_1\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"claim_condition_2\": \"The score on that date was `2-3`\",\n          \"data_value_2\": true\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion: Claim verified\",\n      \"data\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
