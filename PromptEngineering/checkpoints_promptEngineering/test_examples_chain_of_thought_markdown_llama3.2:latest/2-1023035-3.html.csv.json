    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Players**: The first step is to determine which players are currently part of the New Zealand national football team. This requires checking the \"most recent cap\" column for each player, as it indicates when they last played for the team.\n\n2. **Filter Players in Top 20 Goal Scoring**: Next, we need to identify which of these current players are also among the top 20 goal scorers for the New Zealand national football team. This requires checking the \"goals\" column for each player, as it shows their total number of goals scored for the team.\n\n3. **Identify Players Mentioned in Claim**: The claim mentions three specific players: Chris Wood, Chris Killen, and Shane Smeltz. We need to verify that these players are indeed among the top 20 goal scorers and currently part of the national team.\n\n4. **Check Criteria for Each Player**:\n   - For Chris Wood, his \"goals\" column shows 10 goals, which is not in the top 20.\n   - For Chris Killen, his \"goals\" column shows 16 goals, which places him in the top 20. His most recent cap was in 2013, indicating he is currently part of the team.\n   - For Shane Smeltz, his \"goals\" column shows 23 goals, placing him among the top 2 goal scorers for New Zealand. However, we need to verify if he is indeed part of the current national team based on his most recent cap.\n\n5. **Verify Current Team Membership**: \n   - Chris Killen's most recent cap was in 2013, which indicates he is currently part of the team.\n   - Shane Smeltz's most recent cap was in 2013 as well, but only for New Caledonia. We need to confirm if he plays for New Zealand now or not.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on our analysis, Chris Killen and potentially other players (depending on their current status) are in the top 20 goal scorers. However, without confirmation of Shane Smeltz's current team membership and a detailed list of all top-scoring New Zealand players as of the last cap date, we cannot accurately confirm if he is also currently part of the national team.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"current_players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"top_20_goal_scorers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"players_mentioned_in_claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Next, we calculate Chris Wood's total caps for the New Zealand national football team.\n   - row_index = 31\n   - column_name = \"caps\"\n   \n4. Then, we compare Chris Wood's goal and cap counts with all other players on the table to determine if he could be the highest scorer.\n\n5. After comparing Chris Wood's statistics with all other players, we find that the following player has more caps:\n   - player_name = Michael McGarry\n   - row_index = 30 (since we're indexing from 1)\n   - column_name = \"caps\"\n\n6. Since Michael McGarry has a higher number of caps than Chris Wood, and there is no way for Chris Wood to increase his cap count, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n7. However, since there are players with fewer goals than Chris Wood (like Keith Nelson), we need to make sure if it's still possible for Chris Wood to reach more goals than these players.\n\n8. Upon reviewing the table again, we find that:\n   - row_index = 31\n   - column_name = \"goals\"\n\n9. We see that the maximum number of goals scored by any player on the list is 60 (by chris jackson), and Chris Wood currently has 10 goals. In order to surpass this amount, he would need 50 more goals.\n\n10. Given the data, we can conclude that it's not possible for Chris Wood to reach 5 more goals throughout his time with New Zealand national football team, but rather a total of at least 60 goals.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"compared stats with all other players and found Michael McGarry has more caps than Chris Wood\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of caps for Vaughan Coveny**: According to the table, Vaughan Coveny has 64 caps.\n2. **Identify the years when Vaughan Coveny played with the team**: The table shows that Vaughan Coveny played from 1992 to 2006.\n3. **Determine if there are caps during his second and third year of playing with the team**: We need to examine the first two caps for Vaughan Coveny:\n   - The first cap was on June 7, 1992, which is within his first year (1992).\n   - The most recent cap was on June 4, 2006, which is during his third year (2005-2006) of playing with the team.\n4. **Calculate the total number of caps during his second and third years**: Since Vaughan Coveny played for only one more season after the first cap, he has caps in both his second and third years.\n   - The second cap is not specified in the table.\n   - The most recent cap (June 4, 2006) is during his third year. Therefore, Vaughan Coveny must have at least one cap during his second year.\n5. **Calculate the overall number of caps for Vaughan Coveny**: We already determined that Vaughan Coveny has a total of 64 caps.\n6. **Check if Vaughan Coveny's statement about having 19 caps is true**: Vaughan Coveny must have at least one cap in his second year and possibly more caps, so the number 19 is not an accurate representation of his overall caps.\n7. **Determine the truth value of the claim**:\n   - The claim states that Vaughan Coveny has a cap during his second year and during his third year of the team, with a total of 19 caps throughout his time with the team.\n   - Based on our analysis, it is not true.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"career\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"first cap\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"career\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"first cap\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
