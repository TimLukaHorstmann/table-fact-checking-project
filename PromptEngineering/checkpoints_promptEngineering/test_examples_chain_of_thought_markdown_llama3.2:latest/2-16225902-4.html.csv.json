    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the claim means. It says that Tiger Woods' score is only 2 shots better than third place.\n2. According to the table, there are three players in third place with a score of 68.\n3. We need to check if Tiger Woods' score (66) is indeed 2 shots better than any one of these third-place scores.\n4. To do this, we can calculate the difference between Tiger Woods' score and each of the third-place scores:\n\t* 68 - 66 = 2\n\t* 68 - 68 = 0\n\t* 68 - 68 = 0\n\t* 68 - 68 = 0\n5. As we can see, only one of these differences is equal to 2, which is the case for the first player in third place (Fred Couples).\n6. Since there are multiple players in third place with the same score, and Tiger Woods' score is indeed 2 shots better than one of them, it doesn't mean he's 2 shots better overall.\n7. However, if we look at the table again, we can see that all three players in third place have the same score (68), but they are not tied with a lower number since no other player is below those scores - only above. Thus Tiger Woods' score of 66 being two shots better than any one of them makes it true.\n8.

First, let's analyze the claim: \"Mark Hensby be the only player to score 5 under par in the 2005 open championship\".\n   We need to check if Mark Hensby scored exactly 5 under par and see if he is indeed the only one.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we find that there are multiple players (Fred Couples, Luke Donald, Retief Goosen, Trevor Immerman, Peter Lonard, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, Eric Ramsay(A), Chris Riley, Tino Schuster, and Scott Verplank) who all scored 68. Since 68 is 4 under par, this means that at least these players did not score exactly 5 under par.\n\n3. Now we need to verify if Mark Hensby indeed scored exactly 67.\n   According to the table, Mark Hensby's score was 67 which is 1 under par. This does not match our initial claim of a 5-under-par score.\n\n4. Given that there are players with scores below 68 (such as Fred Couples with a score of 67) and none of them scored exactly 5 under par, Mark Hensby's single-digit under-par score cannot be the only one.\n   Furthermore, since we found at least one player who also scored a single digit under par in 2005 open championship (Fred Couples), it means that the claim is not true.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Check if Mark Hensby scored exactly 5 under par\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Verify if Mark Hensby's score was indeed 67\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Find players with scores below 68 that did not score exactly 5 under par\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Conclude the claim is false\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to identify the number of players tied for third place. To do this, we can look at the column labeled \"to par\", which shows all the scores. The row with a score of 68 has 6 rows below it (t3), indicating that there are 6 players tied for third place.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine how many of these 6 players are from Australia. To do this, we can look at the column labeled \"country\", which shows the nationality of each player.\n\n3. We know that one of the players (Peter Lonard) is from Australia. Since there are 6 players tied for third place and only one is from Australia, we need to find out how many other players are also from Australia in the list of ties.\n\n4. Upon inspecting the table again, we see that Peter Lonard is not the only Australian player listed under \"t3\", actually three players (Peter Lonard, Mark Hensby and Peter Lonard) are tied for t3 and two  are from Australia\n\n5. Since there are indeed 3 players from Australia among the 6 tied for third place, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the number of players tied for third place.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Look at the column labeled 'to par' to find all scores.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine how many of these players are from Australia.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Look at the column labeled 'country' to find each player's nationality.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify that three players are indeed from Australia.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Inspect the table again and count the number of Australian players under 't3'.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    } \n  ]\n}",
