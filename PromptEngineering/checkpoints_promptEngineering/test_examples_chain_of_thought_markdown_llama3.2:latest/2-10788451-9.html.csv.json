Compare these averages to 14.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculations:\n\n#### Collingwood\nThe away team score is listed in column 'away team score'. The home team is 'collingwood' which appears in the same row as the away team's score, so we don't need that value for collingwood.\n```markdown\nAway Team Score: 12.14 (86)\n```\nAverage Away Score = Total Away Score / Number of Games Played by Collingwood\n= 86/1 \n= 86\n\n#### St Kilda\nThe away team score is listed in column 'away team score'. The home team is 'st kilda' which appears in the same row as the away team's score, so we don't need that value for st kilda.\n```markdown\nAway Team Score: 18.14 (122)\n```\nAverage Away Score = Total Away Score / Number of Games Played by St Kilda\n= 122/1 \n= 122\n\n### Comparing to 14:\n- Collingwood's average away team score is 86, which is greater than 14.\n- St Kilda's average away team score is 122, which is also greater than 14.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince neither Collingwood nor St Kilda have an average away team score below 14, the statement in question is FALSE.",
