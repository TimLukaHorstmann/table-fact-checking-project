Then count how many times a race with the Judd V8 engine was used.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the relevant data in table\nThe entrants listed are:\n- SASOL JORDAN YAMHA (used jordan 192 and yamaha v12)\n- LEYTON HOUSE (used march 881, march cg891, leyton house cg901 and ilever wasnt on engine but judd v8) \n\n### Step 5: Count how many times a race with the Judd V8 engine was used by Mauricio Gugelmin\nLooking at row 1989 we see that 2 races (1 for \"LEYTON HOUSE RACING\" using March 881 and one using march cg891 ) were held, both using Judd v8 engines.\nLooking at row 1990 we see that a race was held by LEYTON HOUSE with Judd v8.\nWe can find out the row of Mauricio Gugelmins entry to this table as he only had one and his engine was also judd V8\n\n### Step 6: Count how many total races are there for Mauricio Gugelmin \nMauricio Gugelmin made a total of three entries.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the answer\nWe can see that out of his three entries, two races used Judd V8 engines ( row 1989 with March cg891 and row 1990).

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to check if Maruicio Gugelmin scored 5 points in his first race in 1988. We can find the relevant information by looking at the \"year\", \"entrant\", and \"pts\" columns.\n\n   - In the given table, there is a row for 1988 with entrant \"leyton house march racing team\" and pts 5.\n   \n2. Next, we need to check if Maruicio Gugelmin never scored 5 points again. We can do this by looking at all the other rows in the table where the entrant is \"leyton house march racing team\", \"leyton house\", or any other relevant entries.\n\n   - In row 1989 for \"leyton house racing\" with chassis March CG891 and engine Judd V8, pts are 4.\n   \n3. We also need to check the points scored by Maruicio Gugelmin in subsequent races.\n\n   - There is no other entry with the name Maruicio Gugelmin that we can find relevant information for.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the claim says \"Maruicio Gugelmin score 5 point in his first race in 1988 and never score 5 point again\", it's impossible to confirm whether he scored a total of 5 points ever. However, since he did not score any 5-point races (only one), we can say that the claim is mostly TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the chassis used by Gugelmin in each year\nTo verify the claim, we need to find out which chassis was used by Gugelmin in each year from 1988 to 1992.\n\nLooking at the table, we see that:\n- In 1988, the entrant is Leyton House March Racing Team with chassis March 881.\n- In 1989, there are two entries for Leyton House Racing: one with chassis March 881 and another with chassis March CG891.\n- Since Gugelmin only competed in the 1990s, we can ignore the entry from 1988.\n- In 1990, the entrant is Leyton House with chassis Leyton House CG901.\n- In 1991, the entrant is Leyton House with chassis Leyton House CG911.\n- In 1992, the entrant is Sasol Jordan Yamaha with chassis Jordan 192.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if Gugelmin's chassis changed from March 881 to Jordan 192\nWe need to check if the chassis used by Gugelmin in each year forms a chain of changing chassis. The claim states that it starts with the March 881 and ends with the Jordan 192.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the sequence of chassis\n- The initial chassis is indeed March 881 (1988).\n- In 1990, the chassis changes to Leyton House CG901.\n- In 1991, the chassis changes again to Leyton House CG911.\n- However, in 1992, there is no entry for Gugelmin or any other driver with the chassis March 881 or Leyton House CG... , but there is a Jordan 192.\n\nThe sequence of chassis does not exactly match the claim: it starts with March 881 and ends with Jordan 192. However, in 1992, we have a \"Jordan\" chassis instead of another Leyton House CG... chassis as would be expected if following the March 881 to CG911 progression.\n\n\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if the sequence matches the claim\nSince Gugelmin did not use a \"Leyton House CG...\" type chassis in 1992 but instead used a Jordan 192, we can conclude that his chassis does change throughout, but it does not follow exactly as stated by the claim.\n\n\n\n#### Step 5: Identify relevant cells for JSON output\nThe following cells are relevant for verifying the chain of thought:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n    ]\n}\n\nThe final answer is: \n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Claim Analysis\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find Maruicio Gugelmin's entry details for 1988 and 1991.\n   - For the year 1988, we see that Maruicio Gugelmin is an entrant of \"leyton house march racing team\" with a chassis of \"march 881\", engine as \"judd v8\".\n   - For the year 1991, we see that Maruicio Gugelmin is an entrant of \"leyton house cg911\" with an engine of \"ilmor v10\".\n\n2. Next, let's find out if Maruicio Gugelmin scored a total of 5 points in both years.\n   - In the year 1988, he scored 5 points.\n   - In the year 1991, he did not score any points (0).\n\n3. Now we can check if our findings match the claim that Maruicio Gugelmin scored 5 points in his first race in 1988 and then again in 1991.\n\n#### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on our previous steps, we see that:\n- Maruicio Gugelmin scored a total of 5 points only in the year 1988.\n- There is no indication that he scored another 5 point score in 1991.\nTherefore, the claim does not hold true.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"entry\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"points\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"year\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"pts\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that Gugelmin's auto stays with the same chassis, March 881, over the years.\n2. Looking at the table, we need to check if there are any instances where Gugelmin's entry uses a different chassis than March 881.\n3. In 1989, there is an instance where Gugelmin's team is listed as \"Leyton House Racing\", but with a chassis of \"March CG891\". Although the team name remains the same, this shows that the chassis has changed in one instance (even though we are comparing to Gugelman, not gugelmen).\n4. Looking at 1990 and 1991, Gugelmin's entries use different chassis: \"Leyton House CG901\" and \"Leyton House CG911\", respectively.\n5. However, in the claim only 1988 is given for this question (and we should be looking at how he went from there to 89).\n6. In 1989, Gugelmin's entry uses a chassis of March 881 (the first time) and then later on March CG891. So, Gugelmen goes from the 881 to the CG891 in that year.\n7. Looking at how it went into the next year, as seen in the table we can see that Gugelman stays with 881 for one more year (the last known entry).\n8. Since he does not move away from March 881 after staying on March 881 for one full year and changing to 891 from it, this supports the claim of him sticking to the same chassis for a couple of years in succession.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"reasoning\": \"The claim states that Gugelmin's auto stays with the same chassis, March 881, over the years.\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\", \"reasoning\": \"Looking at the table, we need to check if there are any instances where Gugelmin's entry uses a different chassis than March 881.\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\", \"reasoning\": \"In 1989, there is an instance where Gugelmin's team is listed as \\\"Leyton House Racing\\\", but with a chassis of \\\"March CG891\\\".\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\", \"reasoning\": \"Although the team name remains the same, this shows that the chassis has changed in one instance (even though we are comparing to Gugelmen, not gugelmen)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\", \"reasoning\": \"Looking at 1990 and 1991, Gugelmin's entries use different chassis: \\\"Leyton House CG901\\\" and \\\"Leyton House CG911\\\", respectively.\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\", \"reasoning\": \"However, in the claim only 1988 is given for this question (and we should be looking at how he went from there to 89).\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\", \"reasoning\": \"In 1989, Gugelmin's entry uses a chassis of March 881 (the first time) and then later on March CG891.
