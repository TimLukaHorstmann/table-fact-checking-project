According to the table, Tomasz Sikora's event is \"1994 lillehammer\", and his individual result in the sprint is listed as 32nd. Since 32nd is above 32nd place, this row does not support the claim.\n4. Next, we look at the other rows: Tomasz Sikora finished 28th at the 1998 Nagano - nozawa event (below 32nd), 31st at the 2002 Salt Lake City event (above 20th but below 32nd), and 29th at the 2010 Vancouver event (above 20th).\n5. We also notice that Tomasz Sikora finished 18th at the 2006 Turin event (below 20th) and 25th at the 2002 Salt Lake City event does not count because it was in pursuit, so it can be excluded.\n6. Also there is no data of Tomasz Sikora in the relay section. Therefore, we only need to consider the individual, sprint, and pursuit sections.\n7. We have found two rows that contradict the claim: 1998 Nagano - nozawa (28th) and 2006 Turin (18th).
