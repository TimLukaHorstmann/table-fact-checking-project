Since there are indeed 3 games played at Busch Stadium (i), this part of the claim is true.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the attendance data matters for the claim\nThe claim does not mention anything about attendance, so we can ignore that column for this specific question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Count the total number of games played at Busch Stadium (i) in October\",\n      \"analysis\": \"Counting games played at Busch Stadium (i)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Identify the relevant games played at Busch Stadium (i)\",\n      \"analysis\": \"Identifying games played at Busch Stadium (i)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Count the number of relevant games\",\n      \"analysis\": \"Counting the number of games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 4: Check if the claim is true\",\n      \"analysis\": \"Checking if the claim is true\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
