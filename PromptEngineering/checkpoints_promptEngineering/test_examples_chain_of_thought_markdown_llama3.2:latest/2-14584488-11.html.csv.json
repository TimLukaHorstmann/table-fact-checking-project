    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the column of interest**: The claim mentions \"attendance\", so we need to focus on the \"attendance\" column.\n2. **Locate all relevant cells for attendance**: We will examine each row in the table where there is a mention of \"attendance\". This includes rows 5, 27, 16, 9, 6, and 17.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n]\n```\n\n3. **Find the highest attendance value**: The values in the \"attendance\" column are 2420, 6855, 15339, 32896, 82752, and 89874.\n\n4. **Determine if the highest attendance was at the game against Middlesbrough**:\nWe need to compare this highest value with the \"attendance\" value in row 9 (the game against Middlesbrough).\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n],\n{\n  \"highest_attendance_value\": 89874,\n  \"relevant_attendance_value\": 32896\n}\n```\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the highest attendance (89874) was at a different game than Middlesbrough (32896), the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column of interest: attendance\",\n    \"Locate all relevant cells for attendance: rows 0-5\",\n    {\n      \"highest_attendance_value\": 89874,\n      \"relevant_attendance_value\": 32896\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Find the relevant cells in the table:\n   - For the attendance at the Hereford United game: `6855`\n   - For the attendance at the Wolverhampton Wanderers game: `15339`\n3. Compare the values to evaluate the claim:\n   - The attendance at the Hereford United game (`6855`) is less than the attendance at the Wolverhampton Wanderers game (`15339`).\n4. Conclusion based on comparison:\n   - Since the attendance at the Hereford United game is lower, the claim that \"the attendance at the Hereford United game be higher than the attendance at the Wolverhampton Wanderers game\" is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Find the relevant cells in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Compare the values to evaluate the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion based on comparison\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
