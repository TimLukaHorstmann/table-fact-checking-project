The relevant rows are:\n\t* row_index 1 (row 1): reece gaines\n\t* row_index 2 (row 2): kiwane garris\n\t* row_index 3 (row 3): pat garrity\n\t* row_index 4 (row 4): chris gatling\n\t* row_index 5 (row 5): drew gooden\n\t* row_index 6 (row 6): marcin gortat\n\t* row_index 7 (row 7): horace grant (first occurrence)\n\t* row_index 8 (row 8): horace grant (second occurrence)\n5.

According to the table, Pat Garrity played for the Magic from 2001-2003 and previously played for the Orlando team during a 9-year period.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate total time with Orlando Magic\nLooking at the table, we see that Pat Garrity's second stint with the Orlando Magic (2001-2003) lasted 2 years. His first stint, although not explicitly listed, is mentioned in another row as part of a longer 9-year period before joining the team.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if Pat Garrity's first stint is within the same time frame\nPat Garrity's first stint with the Orlando Magic started in 2001 and ended in 2003. This means he was there for approximately 2 years, but we need to compare this to his longer tenure before joining the team.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the duration of Pat Garrity's stints with Orlando Magic\nPat Garrity played a total of 9 years with the Orlando team before and after his first stint. To determine if the claim is true, we must check that the longest time span he was associated with the Orlando team indeed covers 9 consecutive years.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the answer to the claim\nThe first mention in the table indicates Pat Garrity played for Orlando between \"1994 - 1999\" (5 years) and a second stint from \"2001-2003\" which is 2 more years. This means his two stints together cover a total of 7 years, not 9.\n\n### Step 6: Output the final answer in JSON format\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract relevant information from the table\",\n      \"description\": \"Looking at the given data to determine Pat Garrity's time with Orlando Magic\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate total time with Orlando Magic\",\n      \"description\": \"Total years Pat Garrity played for Orlando Magic is 2 (from 2001-2003) plus some before that which also ended in orlando team.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if Pat Garrity's first stint is within the same time frame\",\n      \"description\": \"Looking into previous stints before joining and to confirm how long his first stint was\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the duration of Pat Garrity's stints with Orlando Magic\",\n      \"description\": \"Determining if two stints added up indeed make 9 years which the question asked about.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the answer to the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"Based on calculations and information gathered, determine whether the claim is true or false\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
