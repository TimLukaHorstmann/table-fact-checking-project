However, considering the phrasing \"there be 2 successor in congress,\" it could imply a specific period or event rather than an absolute count of separate terms starting within that timeframe.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The original claim might be too broad to confirm as false given our finding of at least one successor (Fitzpatrick), even if only for part of the specified period. Without clear guidance on what \"between 1855 and 1857\" means in terms of time for successors starting their terms, we lean towards it being somewhat true.\n\nHowever, given this analysis is based on specific rules rather than inclusive language around successor start dates and the phrasing might imply a need to count only those strictly between or after these dates, our confidence increases that there indeed were at least two successors but remains cautious in directly affirming \"there be 2 successor\" due to ambiguity.\n\nGiven the data, it's reasonable to conclude:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
