    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to identify which beers from West Berkshire Brewery won awards between 1995 and 2009.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there are three different beers from West Berkshire Brewery: \"good old boy\", \"maggs magnificent mild\", and \"dr hexter's healer\".\n\n3. We will examine each of these beers to determine if any of them won a single award between 1995 and 2009.\n\n4. Starting with \"good old boy\", we find that it won an overall winner award at the Camra White Horse Branch Beer Festival in 1995. So, one award has been found for \"good old boy\".\n\n5. Next, we check \"maggs magnificent mild\". It appears that this beer won a gold medal at several different awards between 2002 and 2006. Therefore, three awards have now been found.\n\n6. Finally, we look at \"dr hexter's healer\", which won a gold medal at both the Camra Reading Branch Beer Festival in 2008 and the Camra London and South East Regional Competition in 2009. So, another award has been found for \"dr hexter's healer\".\n\n7. Having checked all three beers from West Berkshire Brewery, we can conclude that indeed three of their beers each won a single award between 1995 and 2009.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"beer name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"prize\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"beer name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"prize\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the Claim to be Verified\nThe claim states that West Berkshire Brewery's 'Dr Hexter Healer' beer won 3 gold medals between 1995 and 2009.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Relevant Information from the Table\nTo verify this claim, we need to find the rows in the table where 'Dr Hexter Healer' appears as both the beer name and the prize (gold medal), specifically within the years specified (1995-2009).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Rows for the Claim\nLooking at the table:\n- In 2002, 'Dr Hexter's Healer' won gold medals in two categories ('best bitter' and 'mild and porter'), but no overall or beer of the festival win is mentioned.\n- In 2003, there is no mention of 'Dr Hexter's Healer'.\n- In 2004, there is a win in the 'overall winner' category for 'Maggs Magnificent Mild', not 'Dr Hexter's Healer'.\n- In 2005, 'Dr Hexter's Wedding Ale' won third place in the 'best bitter' category, but this does not match our claim.\n- However, in 2006 and 2008 and 2009:\n    - There is no 'Dr Hexter's Healer' mentioned as a prize winner. Instead, these years mention 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' as the beer name with gold medals won.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the Claim is True or False\nThe only year that directly matches part of the claim (winning multiple golds) involves 'Dr Hexter's Healer', but this occurs in a different context than described by the claim. There is no instance where 'Dr Hexter's Healer' appears both as a beer name and a prize winner across three separate years between 1995 and 2009.\n\n### Step 5: List Relevant Cells\nSince there isn't a direct match to the claim in any of the provided years, and some calculations or verifications were necessary:\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Identify the claim to be verified\",\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Locate relevant information from the table\",\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Analyze rows for the claim\",\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Determine if the claim is true or false\",\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Identify the claim to be verified\",\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Locate relevant information from the table\",\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Analyze rows for the claim\",\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Determine if the claim is true or false\",\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We will start by looking at the table for any information related to this beer.\n\n3. The relevant data points are:\n   - 1997: Dr Hexter 's healer (runner up, not a silver medal)\n   - 2002: Dr Hexter 's healer (gold medal and silver medal in different categories)\n   - 2008: Dr Hexter 's healer (gold medal in two categories)\n\n4. Based on this information, we can see that the beer has won gold medals, but also a total of at least one silver medal.\n\n5. To determine if it's only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009, we need to check for any other relevant data points within this time period (excluding 2002 where it had both gold and silver medals).\n\n6. Looking at the years from 1995 to 2002:\n   - No other direct data point is available for 'Dr Hexter Healer' that shows a medal of silver during these years.\n\n7. However, in 2009, we see Dr Hexter 's healer receiving gold medals in two categories but no information about a single silver medal for the year between 1995 and 2002 can be found.\n\n8. From 2003 onwards:\n   - The beer receives multiple bronze medals.\n   - There is also one instance of it being in the \"in category\" section which might suggest a specific award, however there isn't enough information provided to determine if this is considered as separate from other awards.\n\n9.

Out of these categories, there are 7 where it won a gold medal: \n    - Camra Great British Beer Festival (Best Bitter)\n    - Bracknell Blues and Real Ale Festival (Beer of the Festival)\n    - Camra Reading Branch Beer Festival (Mild, Overall)\n    - Siba South East Region Beer Competition (Gold Medal for Mild & Porter, Overall)\n3. Given that there are 7 gold medal wins out of 13 total prizes won by Maggs Magnificent Mild between 1995 and 2009, it does not meet the criteria of winning a gold medal in every single instance where it won a prize.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"beer name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"prize\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2002, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2003, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2004, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2005, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim we need to verify: \"west berkshire brewery 's maggs magnificent mild 2 time receive a bronze award at the siba national beer competition between 1995 and 2005\"\n\n2. Determine what information is required to verify this claim:\n   - Is Maggs Magnificent Mild brewed by West Berkshire Brewery?\n   - Has it received a Bronze Award at SIBA National Beer Competition?\n\n3. Find relevant data in the table:\n   - Check if 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' is mentioned as being brewed by 'West Berkshire Brewery'. This requires examining all beers with this name.\n   - Look for instances where 'bronze award' is given to any beer named 'Maggs Magnificent Mild', specifically from a competition called 'SIBA National Beer Competition'.\n\n4. Analyze the years mentioned in the claim (1995-2005) and cross-reference them with the data found:\n   - Verify that all relevant bronze awards for 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' occurred between 1995 and 2005.\n\n### Chain of Thought:\n\nTo verify if West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild has received a Bronze Award at SIBA National Beer Competition, we must ensure two conditions are met: \n1. The beer is brewed by West Berkshire Brewery.\n2. It has won a bronze award from the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005.\n\n**Step 1:** Ensure 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' is indeed brewed by West Berkshire Brewery.\n\n- Looking at the table, under columns where \"beer name\" equals \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\", verify if there's an entry indicating the brewery as West Berkshire.\n- Upon reviewing the table for this specific beer, it appears that all relevant instances indicate 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' is brewed by West Berkshire Brewery.\n\n**Step 2:** Verify that Maggs Magnificent Mild has won a bronze award at SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005.\n\n- Now, we need to verify if there are any records of Maggs Magnificent Mild receiving a Bronze Award specifically from the SIBA National Beer Competition during the years specified.\n- After reviewing the table for such instances:\n  - In 2003, 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' receives a silver medal, not bronze.\n  - There is no explicit mention of winning a Bronze Medal in any year between 1995 and 2005 that matches our criteria.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can conclude that while Maggs Magnificent Mild from West Berkshire Brewery does appear to be recognized within the competition, there's an absence of direct evidence supporting its receipt of a bronze award specifically at SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005 as claimed.\n\nTherefore, based on our step-by-step analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Verification that Maggs Magnificent Mild is brewed by West Berkshire Brewery\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Confirmation of Bronze Award at SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object explains the reasoning steps taken to verify the claim and concludes that the claim provided is FALSE.",
