For \"le4\", the imperial value is \"~0.2133 dr\", and for \"fan1\", it's also \"~0.2133 dr\".\n\n3. Now, we can see that the claim states that the imperial values for both \"\u5398\" and \"\u5206\" are approximately equal to ~0.2133 dr.\n\n4.

To do this, we will check the values in the table for \"relative value\".\n3. For the row \"lei4\", the relative value is 1 / 1600. This matches our claim.\n4. Now we need to verify if there's another matching value in a different row.\n5. We can see that for the row \"fan1\", the relative value is also 1 / 1600, which is the same as the value in row \"lei4\".\n6. Since both \"liz\" and \"condorim\" have a relative value of 1 / 1600, we need to verify if this value also matches for \"\u5206\".\n7.

The same applies to the \u201c \u65a4\u201d character with its respective unit, as specified under \u201crelative value\". Thus two different characters do indeed have their value measured in gram.\n\n\nStep 5: Verify if there are any other characters with metric values in grams.\nAfter checking all relevant data, we see that there isn't any further case where \"character\" is either \"\u9322\" or \" \u65a4\" and both the relative value and metric value are in grams. Hence, no extra information was needed to verify this specific claim.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Generate response based on verification.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Observe the claim to be verified.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Look at the table structure to understand what each column represents.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant data for the claim.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check which characters have metric values in grams.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Verify if there are any other characters with metric values in grams.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Generate response based on verification\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"relative value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"relative value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"relative value\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
