Next, we compare the value in this cell under the \"govt salary\" column with the highest values in other rows related to other individuals. However, without going through each individual, we can first identify the top 2 salaries by comparing the values under \"govt salary\" for all relevant entries:\n   - hk134150 appears three times which means it is tied as one of the highest salaries.\n   - The value hk149055 and hk163960 also appear in more than one row.\n\n3. Now, to determine if Katherine Ng Kit - Shuen's salary (hk163960) is indeed higher than any other \"govt salary\" mentioned:\n\n4. From the data:\n    - hk134150 is tied three times.\n    - hk149055 appears once with a lower value than hk163960.\n    - hk163960 appears once with a higher value than hk149055 and all instances of hk134150.\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Identify the column related to age: The column is called \"age at appointment\".\n2. Find the row of Victor Lo Yik - Kee's information in the table:\n   * Row index can be found by locating \"lo yik - kee, victor\" in the markdown table.\n   * The corresponding row index is 4.\n3. Get the value for age at appointment from that row:\n   * Value is located in the cell with column name \"age at appointment\".\n   * Value is 55\n4. Identify if Victor Lo Yik - Kee's age is the youngest in the table:\n   * To do this, compare his age to other values in the same column.\n   * The relevant cells for comparison are those in rows 1 through 7, except row 4 (Victor Lo Yik - Kee).\n5. Determine if Victor Lo Yik - Kee's age is indeed the youngest based on step 4:\n   * If there are no younger entries than his age, he would be the youngest.\n   * Upon inspection of rows 1 through 7, except row 4 (Victor Lo Yik - Kee), we can find that Victor Lo Yik - Kee's age (55) is not less than any other entry in that column. For instance:\n    + Row 1 has an age of 28.\n    + Row 2 has an age of 46.\n    + Row 3 has an age of 37\n    + Row 5 has an age of 35\n    + Rows 6 and 7 have ages of 34 and 31, respectively.\n    From this comparison we can conclude that Victor Lo Yik - Kee's age is not the youngest in that column based on the other entries (except row 4).\n6. Conclude whether or not the claim about Victor Lo Yik - Kee being the youngest when he was appointed:\n   * Since Victor Lo Yik - Kee's age is not less than any other entry for his respective group, it can be concluded that the statement in the question (\"victor lo yik - kee be the youngest when he be appoint\") is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identify the column related to age: The column is called \\\"age at appointment\\\".\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Find the row of Victor Lo Yik - Kee's information in the table: Row index can be found by locating \\\"lo yik - kee, victor\\\" in the markdown table.
