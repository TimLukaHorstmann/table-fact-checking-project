    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, let's identify the relevant information for the claim about Jim McKenzie and Jackson Penney being from the same team:\n   - We need to find both players in the table.\n   - We need to check if they are from the same team.\n\n2. Let's start by looking up Jim McKenzie in the table:\n   - Row index: 73\n   - Column name: position\n   - Team: Hartford Whalers (WHL)\n\n3. Now, let's look up Jackson Penney in the table:\n   - Row index: 80\n   - Column name: team\n   - Team: Boston Bruins (NHL)\n\n4. Since Jim McKenzie played for the Hartford Whalers and Jackson Penney played for the Boston Bruins, we can conclude that they are not from the same team.\n\n5. However, looking at the table again, we notice a different team mentioned for both Jim McKenzie:\n   - Row index: 73\n   - Column name: college / junior / club team\n   - Team: Victoria Cougars (WHL)\n\n6. Similarly, let's look up Jackson Penney in the WHL column:\n   - Row index: 80\n   - Column name: college / junior / club team\n   - Team: Victoria Cougars (WHL)\n\n7. Since both players were actually from the same team - Victoria Cougars (WHL), we can conclude that our initial assumption was incorrect.\n\n8. Let's double-check the claim again:\n   - Jim McKenzie and Jackson Penney are indeed from the same team, but it is not stated in any of their individual rows as \"Victoria Cougars\".\n   - Instead, both players were listed under different categories (NHL for McKenzie, NHL for Penney), however the key category that corresponds to Jim's position is actually mentioned: WHL.\n   - However, looking at the relevant row index and column name:\n     * Row index 80\n     * Column name: nhl team \n     - This matches Penneys information. It does not match McKenzies as his NHL Team is listed as Los Angeles Kings.\n\n9. We can now confirm that Jim McKenzie and Jackson Penney are indeed from the same team, which is Victoria Cougars (WHL).\n\n10. However, there is one more relevant piece of information that needs to be checked in order to fully assess whether this claim is true or false:\n     * Row index 73\n     * Column name: nhl team \n     - Team: Hartford Whalers \n\n11. Since Jim McKenzie's NHL team is listed as Hartford Whalers, and the Victoria Cougars are actually his WHL team then it can be said he does indeed play for the same organization.\n\n12. However Jackson Penney's NHL team also plays in Boston which means he also represents the same organization.\n\n13. Therefore, our initial conclusion was correct that both Jim McKenzie and Jackson Penney were from the same team.\n\n\n### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 73,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 80,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 73,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 80,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 80,\n      \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 73,\n      \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 73,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 80,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 80,\n      \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 73,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the column headers in the table that correspond to the claim: \"position\", \"nationality\", and \"college / junior / club team\".\n2. Look for the specific row index mentioned in the claim (64-84) to find relevant information about goal tender position players.\n3. In the specified range of rows, identify which player is listed as a goaltender (\"goal tenders\" or variations like \"goaltender\").\n4. If no goal tenders are found, check if there's any variation in spelling (e.g., \"G\") for a goalkeeper.\n5. Verify that the player identified in step 3 has a position listed as \"goalie\".\n\nNow, let's perform these steps with the provided table:\n\n1. The column headers matching the claim are:\n   - \"position\"\n   - \"nationality\"\n   - \"college / junior / club team\"\n\n2. We will examine each row from index 64 to 84 to find relevant information about goal tender position players.\n\n3. Looking at the rows in the table, we see that there are several players with positions like \"goaltender\" or variations of the word for goaltenders:\n   - Row 69: \"allain roy\" is listed as a \"goaltender\".\n   - Row 83: \"andre racicot\" is also a \"goalie\".\n\n4. Based on our findings, we can now evaluate whether there's only one goal tender position player in the specified range.\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Count the number of Canadian players in rows 64-84:\n   - Row 64: Brent Grieve (Canada)\n   - Row 68: Niklas Andersson (Sweden), but there are also more Canadian players listed after this row, so we should count them as well.\n   - Row 69: Allain Roy (Canada)\n   - Row 70: Robert Reichel (Czechoslovakia) is not Canadian\n   - Row 72: Reid Simpson (Canada)\n   - Row 73: Jim McKenzie (Canada)\n   - Row 75: J F Quintin (Canada)\n   - Row 76: Eric Dubois (Canada)\n   - Row 77: Doug MacDonald (Canada)\n   - Row 79: Todd Nelson (Canada)\n   - Row 80: Jackson Penney (Canada)\n   - Row 82: Trent Klatt (United States) is not Canadian, but Ryan O'Leary (United States) is not either\n   There are only 9 rows with a \"canada\" nationality listed. So there should be less than 10.\n\n2. Count the number of US players in rows 64-84:\n   - Row 64: Mark Browneschidle (USA)\n   - Row 65: Brent Grieve (Canada), but then comes another row for Jim Cummins (USA) and after this, Matt Martin (USA)\n   - Row 66: Matt Martin (USA)\n   - Row 67: Jim Cummins (USA)\n   - Row 68: Niklas Andersson (Sweden) is not US\n   - Row 69: Allain Roy (Canada), but then comes another row for Jim Maher, so it has to be US. And after this row, there are J F Quintin and Eric Dubois listed as Canadian players but they have a US junior team too. However the next player will be Trent Klatt that is also a US player\n   - Row 70: Robert Reichel (Czechoslovakia) is not US.\n   - Row 71: Brett Hauer (USA)\n   - Row 72: Reid Simpson (Canada), but then comes another row for Jim McKenzie which has to be USA, however, the next one is Trent Klatt which again is a US player\n   - Row 73: Jim McKenzie (USA) \n   - Row 74: Sergei Fedorov (Soviet Union) is not US.\n   - Row 75: J F Quintin (Canada)\n   - Row 76: Eric Dubois (Canada)\n   - Row 77: Doug MacDonald (Canada)\n   - Row 78: Josef Beranek (Czechoslovakia) is not US\n   - Row 79: Todd Nelson (USA)\n   - Row 80: Jackson Penney (USA)\n   - Row 81: Jim Maher (USA)\n   - Row 82: Trent Klatt (USA)\n   There are at least 12 rows with a \"usa\" nationality listed. However we will not count the following players that have both US and Canadian teams.\n   The first player to be counted as US is Brent Grieve, then Matt Martin, Jim Cummins, Robert Reichel, Brett Hauer, Jim McKenzie, Todd Nelson, Jackson Penney, Jim Maher, Trent Klatt, so there are 11 rows with a \"us\" nationality listed.\n\n3. Determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n   Since there are more US players (at least 11) than Canadian players (only 9), we have to determine how many of those \"US\" players actually were US players before their junior teams were considered. There are 5 rows with both a \"canada\" and \"us\" nationality, so the count should be reduced by this number.\n   The number of rows that contain only a \"us\" nationality is then 11 - 5 = 6\n   Since there are more than 6 US players, the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. Determine which cells from the table we need to output in our answer:\n   We will count all rows with a \"canada\" nationality and rows that have both \"us\" and \"canada\" nationality, as well as the row for each of the Canadian players listed before their junior teams were considered.\n   The following rows should be counted: 64 (Brent Grieve), 68 (Niklas Andersson), 69 (Allain Roy), 72 (Reid Simpson), 73 (Jim McKenzie), 75 (J F Quintin), 76 (Eric Dubois), 77 (Doug MacDonald), 79 (Todd Nelson), 80 (Jackson Penney), 82 (Ryan O'Leary).\n   The following rows should be counted as well: 65 (Brent Grieve), 66 (Matt Martin), 67 (Jim Cummins), 71 (Brett Hauer), 78 (Josef Beranek)\n   But because there was already a \"US\" nationality listed in the row for Jim Cummins, Matt Martin and Brett Hauer. Therefore we have to make sure that the rows for these players are not counted again.\n   The following rows should be counted as well: 68 is excluded from this list because Niklas Andersson has no US nationality.\n   The following rows should be counted as well: 69 is excluded from this list because Allain Roy was already counted above, and also Josef Beranek should not be included as he has a \"Czechoslovakia\" nationality\n   Therefore, the total number of Canadian players listed is 9 + 8 = 17.\n   The following rows should be counted: 64 (Brent Grieve), 65 (Brent Grieve), 66 (Matt Martin), 67 (Jim Cummins), 68 (Niklas Andersson), 69 (Allain Roy), 70 (Robert Reichel), 71 (Brett Hauer), 72 (Reid Simpson), 73 (Jim McKenzie), 75 (J F Quintin), 76 (Eric Dubois), 77 (Doug MacDonald), 79 (Todd Nelson), 80 (Jackson Penney), 82 (Ryan O'Leary)\n   The number of rows that have a \"US\" nationality is then: 11 - 5 = 6\n   The following rows were not counted before and have been included in our list for the US players because they had to be reduced. However, we did count them above.\n   We will now make sure there are no duplicates.\n\nHere are the cell numbers that should be included in the answer:\n   There are more than 6 \"US\" rows and less than or equal to 9 \"canada\" rows, therefore the claim is FALSE.\n   The following cells for the players with only a US nationality should be counted: 65 (Brent Grieve), 66 (Matt Martin), 67 (Jim Cummins), 71 (Brett Hauer), 73 (Jim McKenzie) and 78 (Josef Beranek).\n   There are no \"canada\" rows that have not been included already.",
