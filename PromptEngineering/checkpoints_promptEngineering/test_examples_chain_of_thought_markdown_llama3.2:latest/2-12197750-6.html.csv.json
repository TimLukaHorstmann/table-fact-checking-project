    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that 5 schools are located in the Norsewood area.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check which rows from the table have 'norsewood' as their 'area'.\n3. Looking at the table, the relevant cells for Norsewood area are:\n   ```\n   | column_name     |\n   |-----------------|\n   | roll            |\n   | woodville       |\n   | norsewood       |\n   | woodville school |\n   | n/a             |\n   ```\n4. Among these, we can see that only one row has 'norsewood' in its 'area' cell which is:\n   ``` \n   | area         |   row_index |\n   |--------------|------------|\n   | norsewood    | 7          |\n   ```\n5. Another relevant cell for Norsewood area is:\n   ```\n   | column_name     |\n   |-----------------|\n   | woodville       |\n   ```\n   This is because the claim mentions '5 school be locate in the norsewood area' which includes both 'norsewood' and 'woodville'.\n6. There are more than one row for woodville schools so it's not included.\n7. After checking all relevant rows, we can conclude that there are indeed 2 school located in the Norsewood area.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 5 schools be locate in the norsewood area.
