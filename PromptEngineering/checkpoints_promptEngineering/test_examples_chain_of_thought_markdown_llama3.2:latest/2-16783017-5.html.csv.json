We can only analyze based on the given information.\n\n6. **Check if players from row 11 and relevant other rows meet nationality condition**:\n    Row 11: 'canada'\n    No rows for picks 1-10 are Canadian because they all come from different countries (USA & West Germany)\n   \n7.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that \"the flame have a total of 11 draft picks.\" To determine if this is true, we need to first identify which team \"The Flame\" refers to.\n2. Looking at the table, there are no teams directly named as \"The Flame\". However, there is a team called \"London Knights (OHA)\" associated with player Brad Marsh (D) in round 1.\n3. The OHA stands for Ontario Hockey League. Based on this information, we can infer that \"The Flame\" likely refers to the Calgary Flames, which was a major junior and professional ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta.\n4. With this understanding, our task is now to verify if the Calgary Flames have 11 draft picks.\n5. Looking at the table again, we see that there are indeed several players associated with the Calgary Flames' name or initials (\"calgary wranglers (wchl)\" and \"university of michigan (ncaa)\") in different rounds.\n6. However, I need to double-check if there's a total count of 11 draft picks for the Calgary Flames across all mentioned teams, as some players on the team may have been drafted by other organizations or colleges that aren't included here (like NCAA).\n\nStep #4 was based upon a incorrect understanding. \n\nGiven the information provided in cell |   college / junior / club team      | , I will reevaluate this.\n- The \"calgary wranglers (wchl)\" is indeed associated with Calgary Flames name, but \"university of michigan (ncaa)\" isn't as player from Michigan isn't a draft pick for the \"Calgary Flames\" in round 10.\n7. Looking at the table again, we see that there are indeed several players associated with the Calgary Flames' name or initials (\"calgary wranglers (wchl)\") in different rounds: \n    - Round 8 has dave morrison (rw) which was selected by calgary\n    - Round 9 has doug todd (rw) which was also selected by calgary. \n8. Lastly, there is a player from Calgary who was drafted in round 5 and also another who played for the team before joining university: gord wappel (d) but he plays for regina pats now.\n9. I must calculate the total number of draft picks from Calgary Flames:  \n    - Round 4 has jim macrae (f)\n    - Round 1 has brad marsh (d)\n    - Round 5 has gord wappel (d)\n    - Round 8 has dave morrison (rw)\n    - Round 9 has doug todd (rw) \n\nThe total number of picks is indeed five.\n\n10. Finally, we can verify if this total count of 11 draft picks for the Calgary Flames matches the claim.

There is indeed one person whose full first name starts with Bern:\n\n\n```markdown\n|   round |   pick | player                    | nationality   | college / junior / club team      |\n|--------:|-------:|:--------------------------|:--------------|:----------------------------------|\n|      12 |    196 | bernhardt engelbrecht (g) | west germany  | landshut ev ( bundesliga )        |\n```\n\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nBased on the reevaluation of our rules and data from the table, we have one player with a last name 'Bernhardt' but also another whose first name starts with \"Bern\".

Tim Bernhardt is listed as a player from Cornwall Royals, so this condition is met.\n\n4. **Identify any additional conditions in the claim:** The claim states \"2 of the first 3 draft picks come from the Cornwal Royals\". Since we've already established that at least one of these three players was drafted from Cornwall Royals, and since there's no indication that only two can be true (the claim could simply mean any two or all three), this condition is met.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Given that we have identified two instances where the first 3 draft picks are indeed Canadian and at least one of them is from Cornwall Royals, the claim \"2 of the first 3 draft picks come from the Cornwal Royals\" can be considered as true based on these conditions.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}",
