To determine if the claim is true, we need to compare this value with the capacities of other stadiums in Europe that are part of the NFL league.\n3. From the table, we can see that there is only one stadium mentioned as being part of the NFL league: Wembley Stadium.\n4. Since we are looking for the largest capacity among all NFL stadiums in Europe, we need to check if there are other stadiums with capacities greater than 80000.\n5. After reviewing the table again, I noticed that some columns do not have data (such as \"opened\" and \"city\"). This does not affect our analysis of the claim, so we can ignore those for now.\n6. Looking at the stadium capacity column again, we see that there is another team, \"berlin thunder\", with a capacity value greater than 80000: row_index 11, column_name 'capacity' has a value of 76000.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim is about Wembley Stadium's capacity at row_index 12, column_name 'capacity'.\",\n    \"We need to compare this value with the capacities of other NFL stadiums in Europe.\",\n    \"After reviewing the table again, we found another stadium with a greater capacity: berlin thunder at row_index 11, column_name 'capacity' has a value of 76000.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that the \"arena aufschalke\" was open 3 years before the \"aol arena\".\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - For the claim to be true, we need to find two arenas in the table where one is open for exactly 3 more years than the other.\n   - We also need to ensure that both arenas are indeed opened within the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Find Arena Aufschalke Open Year and AOL Arena Open Year**:\n   - From the table, we can see that \"arena aufschalke\" was opened in 2001.\n   - The \"aol arena\" has a different capacity column value for two rows, but they are both opened in 1925.\n\n4. **Calculate Time Difference**:\n   - If \"aol arena\" is considered as the starting point (open year), we need to find an arena that was open exactly 3 years later.\n   - This would mean the open year of \"arena aufschalke\" should be either 3 or 5 years before \"aol arena\"\u2019s open year.\n\n5. **Check Time Difference with Arena Aufschalke Open Year**:\n   - Since \"aol arena\" is opened in 1925, if we subtract 5 from this date (as that would give us a more plausible date for \"arena aufschalke\"), we get 1920.\n   - However, there's no match in the table where an arena was opened exactly at 1920.\n\n6. **Check Time Difference with AOL Arena Open Year**:\n   - If we subtract 3 from the open year of \"aol arena\" (which is 1925), we get 1922.\n   - There\u2019s also no match for an arena being opened in 1922 within the table, but it does seem to hint that there might have been some confusion or missing data in calculation.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on available information and assuming a typo, no direct evidence supports the claim as given (\"arena aufschalke\" was open 3 years before \"aol arena\").\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"The claim states that arena aufschalke be open 3 year before aol arena\"},\n    {\"step\": \"We found that 'aol arena' is opened in 1925\"},\n    {\"step\": \"If we subtract 3 from the open year of 'aol arena', we get 1922.
