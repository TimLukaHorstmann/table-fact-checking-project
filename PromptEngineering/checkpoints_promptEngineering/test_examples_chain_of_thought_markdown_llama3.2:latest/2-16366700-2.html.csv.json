    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to verify if Bobby Hull played for the Chicago Blackhawks.\n   - The table shows a list of players with their years played and stats. We will look at bobby hull's row in the table.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate Bobby Hull's total playoff goals.\n   - According to his row in the table, Bobby Hull played from 1957-1972 and scored 62 playoff goals.\n\n3. Now that we know Bobby Hull played for the Chicago Blackhawks, we can verify if he has the most playoff goals among all Chicago Blackhawks players.\n   - To do this, we will compare Bobby Hull's total playoff goals (62) to each of the other players' totals in the table.\n\n4. We need to find a way to access and compare these values without leaving this response. Because, unfortunately I can't view images or execute external code. Hence I'll list the relevant cell details that would be needed for comparison:\n\n   - For comparison, we will look at the following cells: \n       * Steve Larmer's row (row_index = 2): years = 1981-1993, regular season = 406, playoffs = 45, total = 451\n       * Denis Savard's row (row_index = 4): years = 1980 - 1990, 1995-1997, regular season = 377, playoffs = 61, total = 438\n       * Stan Mikita's row (row_index = 2): years = 1959 - 1979, regular season = 541, playoffs = 59, total = 600\n       * Hubert Pit Martin's row (row_index = 6): years = 1967-1977, regular season = 243, playoffs = 26, total = 269\n\n5. Now we can make a comparison between Bobby Hull's total playoff goals (62) and each of the other players' totals:\n   - Stan Mikita played for 21 years and scored 600 total playoff goals.\n   - Denis Savard played for 11 years (combined) and scored 438 total playoff goals.\n   - Steve Larmer played for 12 years and scored 451 total regular season goals, but only 45 total playoff goals.\n   - Hubert Pit Martin played for 2 years and scored 269 total playoff goals.\n\n6. Since none of the other players scored more playoff goals than Bobby Hull (62) during their time with the Chicago Blackhawks, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"Verify if Bobby Hull played for the Chicago Blackhawks\"},\n    {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"Calculate Bobby Hull's total playoff goals\"},\n    {\"step\": 3, \"description\": \"Compare with other players' totals\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The claim is related to the regular season scores, so we need to look at the \"regular season\" column.\n\n2. **Check each player's score**: We will go through each player in the table and check if their regular season score is less than 300 goals.\n\n3. **bobby hull**: 604 (greater than 300), so this claim does not apply to him.\n\n4. **stan mikita**: 541 (less than 300) - this meets the condition of the claim.\n\n5. **steve larmer**: 406 (less than 300) - this also meets the condition of the claim.\n\n6. **denis savard**: 377 (greater than 300), so this claim does not apply to him.\n\n7. **dennis hull**: 298 (less than 300) - another player who meets the condition of the claim.\n\n8. **jeremy roenick**: 267 (less than 300) - yet another player meeting the condition.\n\n9. **tony amonte**: 268 (less than 300), so this also applies to him.\n\n10. **hubert pit martin**: 243 (less than 300), and finally, a player who meets the claim's requirement.\n\n11. **bill mosienko**: 258 (greater than 300), and we see that there is one exception, but all players except this one met the condition.\n\n12. **ken wharram**: 252 (less than 300) - yet another player meeting the condition of the claim.\n\n13. **Review the results**: We have found at least five out of six players who meet the claim's requirement.\n\n14. **Conclusion**: Since we were asked to determine if all players in the regular season scored less than 300 goals, and there is only one exception among the listed players who score more than 300 goals, we can conclude that this statement is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n  ]\n}",

If we find a match, then the claim is false.\n\n### Step 5: Check for duplicate totals\nAfter re-examining the table, I found that there are indeed duplicate totals:\n- denis savard's total (438) matches ken wharram's total (268).\n- hubert pit martin's total (269) matches bill mosienko's total (268).\n\n### Step 6: Determine if the claim is true or false\nSince we found at least two players with the same total, the claim that \"no 2 player have score the same total number of goal\" is false.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Looked at each row of the table and compared totals.\",\n    \"Found no match for bobby hull's total.\",\n    \"Found a match between denis savard's total (438) and ken wharram's total (268).\",\n    \"Found another match between hubert pit martin's total (269) and bill mosienko's total (268).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}",
