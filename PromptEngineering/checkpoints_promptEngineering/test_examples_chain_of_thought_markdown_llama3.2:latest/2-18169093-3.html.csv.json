Since no one is mentioned as having a score exactly equal to their par, we'll have to find rows with scores less than the par for each respective hole.\n\n### Step 3: Find the specific column and row values needed\nWe need to look at rows for t1, t3, t9 to check if any of them finished under par. Since no one has a score equal to their par (e.g., \"70\" for holes with \"par 71\"), we must assume that none of these players have scores less than the par.\n\n### Step 4: Find specific rows and calculate\nLooking at t1, all three scores are tied at 70. This is not under par because it's one stroke above par (e.g., 70 for holes with a par of 71). Therefore, no player in the t1 row finished under par.\n\n### Step 5: Continue examining rows\nMoving on to t3 and t9, we see that every score on each respective hole is exactly equal to the par. Since none of these players' scores were below their par (because they both scored a \"71\" for holes with a \"par 71\"), no one finished under par in these groups either.\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate all possible results\nGiven our analysis, we can conclude that no player on t1, t3, or t9 finished their round of golf under par.

This means they are not tied for 9th.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if there are multiple rows with the same score as in the 9th place row\nSince all players in the 9th place row have a unique score, we need to verify if there are any other rows where all players have the same score.

The \"e\" symbol indicates that the player achieved par, while a \"+\" or \"-\" sign indicates overage or underage of par respectively.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the claim made about the table\nThe claim states that there was no player who achieved their position alone in the 1981 Open Championship. Instead, it claims there must have been a tie at every position because multiple players share the same place.\n\n#### Step 3: Look for any evidence of ties in the \"place\" column\nTo verify this claim, we need to check if any two or more players share the same position. If such instances are found, it supports the claim that there were ties at every position.\n\n#### Step 4: Examine specific positions from the table to support or refute the claim\nFor instance, checking the \"place\" column for each row shows multiple instances where different players occupy the same rank position (e.g., t3, t9). This indicates that indeed, no player achieved their position alone; there were ties at every position.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclude based on evidence found in the table\nGiven the presence of shared positions among multiple players across the leaderboard, it's clear that there were indeed ties at every position in the 1981 Open Championship.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. First, let's identify the number one players who participated in the 1981 Open Championship. To do this, we need to find out which player has the lowest score and check if their country is in the list of countries whose top players are frequently mentioned or have a strong golfing reputation.\n\n2. Looking at table | t9 |, we see that there are seven well-known number one players who participated in the 1981 Open Championship: Arnold Palmer (USA), Ben Crenshaw (USA), Greg Norman (Australia), Jack Nicklaus was not included however nick job of england did finish 2nd in order to identify this 1 player - England had two other great golfers, Bill Rogers and David Jagger. \n\n3. According to the table, the number one players from each country are: \n- Argentina: Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez (70) \n- Australia: Greg Norman (72)\n- England: Nick Job (70), Bill Rogers (72), David Jagger (72)\n- Japan: Isao Aoki (71)\n- New Zealand: Simon Owen (71)\n- Scotland: Sam Torrance (72)\n- United States: Ben Crenshaw (72), Arnold Palmer (72), Greg Norman (72), and Bill Rogers (72) \n\n4. Now, let's analyze the statement in the claim to determine if it is true or false:\n\"In 1981 no number 1 player achieved their position alone , except Argentina\"\n\n5. Looking at table | t9 |, we can see that only one number 1 player from each of Australia and England finished below par but not alone (they had teammates). However in the case of Argentina, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez achieved his score \"e\" meaning one under par - implying that he did achieve their position alone. The claim is false.\n\n\n6. There are no other number one players from any other country that could have been mentioned.\n\n7. Therefore our answer to this problem is FALSE\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Check the Year of the Open Championship\nFirst, we need to verify if the claim refers to the correct year of the Open Championship, which is a part of the table. The claim mentions \"1981 open championship\", so we need to check if this information is available in the table.\n\n#### Step 2: Look for the Score and Ties\nNext, we should look for the score mentioned in the claim (72) and see if there are any ties for that score. According to the table, the score of 72 has multiple players tied with a \"+2\" difference from par.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify Isao Aoki's Score\nWe need to verify if Isao Aoki indeed scored 71 at the Open Championship in question. Since there is no direct information about Aoki's score in the table, we can infer that his actual score might not be relevant.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify David Graham's Score\nSimilarly, we should check David Graham's score as well since he is mentioned in the claim alongside Isao Aoki. However, just like with Aoki, there is no direct information about Graham's score in the table.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the Claim and Table\nGiven that multiple players are tied at a certain score (72), it seems plausible for two of these players to be Isao Aoki and David Graham. The issue here lies in the fact that while both could theoretically have a +1 difference from par, the actual score recorded for each is 71, not 72.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that there's enough evidence in the table to claim two players tied for a score of 72 but since neither player scored exactly 72 due to all of them having a +1 difference from par, the original statement provided seems incorrect\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the Year of the Open Championship\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Year\"]}\n    ],\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look for the Score and Ties\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"]},\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify Isao Aoki's Score\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"]} ,\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify David Graham's Score\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"]} ,\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze the Claim and Table\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"]},\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"claim\"]}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
