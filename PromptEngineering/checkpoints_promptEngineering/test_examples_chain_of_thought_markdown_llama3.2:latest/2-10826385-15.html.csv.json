To verify this, we need to compare the scores of Melbourne as an away team with the other teams.\n3. Looking at the table, there are three instances where Melbourne is the away team:\n\t* Match 1: Melbourne (away) vs Footscray\n\t* Match 2: Melbourne (away) vs North Melbourne\n\t* Match 3: Melbourne (away) vs Collingwood\n4. We need to compare the score of Melbourne in these matches with the lowest score among all away teams.\n5. Checking the scores, we can see that:\n\t* In Match 1, Footscray's score (65) is lower than Melbourne's score (58)\n\t* In Match 2, North Melbourne's score (66) is higher than Melbourne's score (58)\n\t* In Match 3, Collingwood's score (73) is also higher than Melbourne's score (58)\n6. Since Footscray has the lowest score among all away teams in these matches, the claim that Melbourne have the lowest score when playing as the away team is FALSE.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}",

Next, we need to extract all the scores from this column. The scores are: 91, 110, 90, 128, 128, and 73.\n\n3. Now, let's calculate the average of these scores. To do this, we will sum up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.\n\n   Average = (sum of scores) / (total number of scores)\n   \n4. Sum of scores = 91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73\n               = 610\n    \n5. Total number of scores = 6\n   \n6. Now, we can calculate the average:\n   Average = 610 / 6\n           = 101.6667\n\n7. Since our claim is that the average of all home team scores be less than 12, and our calculated average (101.6667) is greater than 12, our reasoning process leads to a contradiction with the claim.\n\n8. However, we must determine if the claim was true or false based on the data provided in the table. Since there are multiple instances of home team scores exceeding 12, we must assess whether this makes the claim entirely false. \n\n9. As it turns out, at least one instance (the score of 101.6667) is greater than 12, but more than half of the games were lost by the home team or had a margin of 2 points, with only 1 game exceeding this threshold.\n\n10. Since we cannot conclude that all home teams scored less than 12 based on this data, it may be possible for some home teams to have scored less than 12. We should look at each score individually to confirm:\n\n    - Footscray: 91\n    - Fitzroy: 110 (This one is definitely greater than 12)\n    - Essendon: 90\n    - Carlton: 128\n    - Hawthorn: 128\n    - Collingwood: 73\n\n11.
