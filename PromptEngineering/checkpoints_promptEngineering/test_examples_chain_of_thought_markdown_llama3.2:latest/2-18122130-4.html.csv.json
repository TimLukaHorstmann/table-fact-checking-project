In row 7 of the table:\n   ```markdown\n| place   | player                | country       |   score | to par   |\n|:--------|:----------------------|:--------------|--------:|:---------|\n| t5      | nick faldo            | england       |      66 | - 5      |\n```\n   This is not relevant either.\n\n6. In row 8 of the table:\n   ```markdown\n| place   | player                | country       |   score | to par   |\n|:--------|:----------------------|:--------------|--------:|:---------|\n| t5      | lee janzen            | united states |      66 | - 5      |\n```\n   This is not relevant.\n\n7. Now, we come to rows containing Ian Woosnam and Craig Parry:\n\n   In row 3 of the table:\n   ```markdown\n| place   | player                | country       |   score | to par   |\n|:--------|:----------------------|:--------------|--------:|:---------|\n| t3      | gordon brand , jnr    | scotland      |      65 | - 6      |\n```\n   This is relevant because it states that Gordon Brand, Jnr is in position 't3'.\n\n   In row 9 of the table:\n   ```markdown\n| place   | player                | country       |   score | to par   |\n|:--------|:----------------------|:--------------|--------:|:---------|\n| t9      | craig parry           | australia     |      67 | - 4      |\n```\n   This is relevant because it states that Craig Parry is in position 't9'.\n\n8. We can now compare these positions to determine if the claim holds true:\n   - Ian Woosnam's position 't3' appears before both Craig Parry and Gordon Brand, Jnr.\n   - According to the claim, we are looking for whether Ia n Woosnam's place is higher than that of both Craig Parry and Gordon Brand , jnr.\n\n9. Based on our observation in step 8:\n    - The claim \"ian woosnam place higher than craig parry and gordon brand , jnr\" holds true.\n\n### JSON Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Understand the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Examine relevant columns for position comparison\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Check positions of the three players in question (Woosnam, Parry and Brand)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"Compare Ian Woosnam's position with Craig Parry's and Gordon Brand , jnr\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states \"craig parry in t5 finish 4 under par\". This means we need to check if Craig Parry's score at T5 is indeed 4 strokes under par.\n\n2. **Locate relevant information in the table**: We can find this information by looking for Craig Parry's row in the table and verifying his score and the par value for the T5 event.\n\n3. **Verify Craig Parry's score and par value for T5**:\n   - Looking at the table, we see that Craig Parry is indeed from Australia (not under the United States), which makes this step important.\n   - For the T5 event, Craig Parry has a score of 67, and his score is stated as being \"4 strokes under par\". However, according to the table's format for 'to par', it should be in the format '-x' where x is the difference between the player's score and the par value. Therefore, the statement should read \"-67\" (indicating 17 over par), but it can't be because we're told that Craig Parry finished \"4 under\". This could indicate an error or a typo.\n\nHowever, if we look closer at \"to par\" for T5: \n- The score is indeed 67. \n- Since \"t5\" denotes the fifth place in a tournament typically denoted as the Masters (in the context of golf major championships - although not specifically stated here), and the par value for the 5th hole or position would be '6' because par values are given relative to each other, that means Craig Parry indeed finished with \"4 under par\".\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate relevant information in the table\",\n      \"cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 14,\n        \"column_name\": \"score\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify Craig Parry's score and par value for T5\",\n      \"cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 14,\n        \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
