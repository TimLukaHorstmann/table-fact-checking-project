These three teams clearly have \"racing\" in their names.\n5. Now we need to verify if there are indeed four such team names as stated by the claim.\n6. We know that we already found three, but there might be another one we missed.\n7. After re-examining the table again, we can see that \"Lazer Partners Racing\" is actually \"Lazier Partners Racing\", which doesn't contain \"racing\".\n8. The only other team name we need to check is Chip Ganassi Racing and Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing don't have it; however, Sarah Fisher Hartman has a racing association with Andy O'gara who was associated as the list owner of Sarah fisher but there isn't any word 'racing' in her team name.\n9.

To verify this, we need to count the number of teams using a Dallara chassis and compare it with the total number of teams.\n3.
