The relevant column for crowd size is `crowd`.\n\n### Step 3: Locate the row(s) with the highest crowd size\nWe can do a simple sort on the `crowd` column to find the highest value.\n\n```markdown\n| home team       | home team score   | away team       | away team score   | venue         |   crowd | date         |\n|:----------------|:------------------|:----------------|:------------------|:--------------|--------:|:-------------|\n| geelong         | 13.6 (84)         | north melbourne | 4.3 (27)          | kardinia park |   21555 | 28 june 1980 |\n| footscray       | 10.13 (73)        | melbourne       | 6.7 (43)          | western oval  |   11785 | 28 june 1980 |\n| hawthorn        | 21.17 (143)       | fitzroy         | 8.7 (55)          | princes park  |    8209 | 28 june 1980 |\n| richmond        | 9.19 (73)         | collingwood     | 7.22 (64)         | mcg           |   64054 | 28 june 1980 |\n| south melbourne | 5.9 (39)          | carlton         | 10.18 (78)        | lake oval     |   12362 | 28 june 1980 |\n| st kilda        | 7.11 (53)         | essendon        | 6.12 (48)         | vfl park      |   20485 | 28 june 1980 |\n```\n\nBy looking at the `crowd` column, we can see that the venue with the highest crowd size is indeed MCG with a crowd of 64054.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the claim\nSince MCG had the highest crowd participation in the 1980 VFL season, and this contradicts the claim, we need to check if there were other venues that had higher crowds but got missed due to some other criterion used by the person making the claim. In fact there is no indication of anyone else having a higher attendance than MCG.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven the data provided in the table and our evaluation above, we can conclude that the original claim \"during the 1980 VFL season , mcg be not the venue with the highest crowd participation\" is false.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\"},\n    {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"Determine the relevant data for comparison\"},\n    {\"step\": 3, \"description\": \"Locate the row(s) with the highest crowd size\"},\n    {\"step\": 4, \"description\": \"Evaluate the claim\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Determine the total number of crowd values in the table.\n   * We know there are 6 games, so we must have at least 6 crowd values.\n   * The crowd values are: 21555, 11785, 8209, 64054, 12362, and 20485.\n\n2. Find the third highest value of the crowd in the table to determine top3 crowd venue. To find this we must first arrange our list from greatest value to smallest. \n   * First: 21555\n   * Second: 64054\n   * Third: 20485\n\n3. Check if VFL Park and Lake Oval are included in the top three according to step 2.\n   * Since both values are lower than the third highest, then they don't belong among the top three.\n\n4. Make conclusion based on steps 1-3:\n   * We can now see that Vfl park is not among the top three crowd venue and neither is Lake Oval.\n\n5.
