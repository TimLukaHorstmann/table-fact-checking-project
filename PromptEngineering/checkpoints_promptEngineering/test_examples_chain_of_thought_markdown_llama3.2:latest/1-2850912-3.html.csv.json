    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps for the claim:\n\n1. To determine if the claim \"5 player list be from the united state\" is true or false, we need to identify the players from the United States.\n\n2. Let's look at each row in the table:\n   - Row 46: ken hodge , jr is listed as being from the United States.\n   - Row 50: toby ducolon is listed as being from the United States.\n   - Row 56: alan perry is listed as being from the United States.\n   - Row 62: jeff norton is listed as being from the United States.\n\n3. We have identified 4 players from the United States so far, but we need to check if there are exactly 5 players from the United States in total.\n\n4. To do this, let's look at every row again and count how many times \"united states\" appears as an entry for nationality:\n   - The claim is saying that 5 of them be from the united state, so we need to find another one.\n   - Row 46: \"united states\"\n   - Row 50: \"united states\"\n   - Row 56: \"united states\"\n   - Row 62: \"united states\"\n\n5. It looks like there are indeed exactly 4 players with United States as their nationality, and we haven't found any player from Canada or Czechoslovakia with the same label.\n\n6. Now let's look for rows that have a different value in the \"nationality\" column.\n   - Row 46: \"united states\"\n   - Row 50: \"united states\"\n   - Row 56: \"united states\"\n   - Row 62: \"united states\"\n\n7. There is no row with United States, however there are indeed other rows that have this nationality.\n\n8. Given the lack of information we cannot determine if it's true or false but given the claim stated that exactly 5 be from united state let us assume the opposite in order to complete the task.\nSo lets look at another case for a different nationality and see how many total players are there that are not \"united states\" from the \"nationality\" column.\n\n9. Row 43: canada\n10. Row 44: canada\n11. Row 45: canada\n12. Row 47: canada\n13. Row 48: canada\n14. Row 49: czechoslovakia (different country)\n15. Row 51: canada\n16. Row 52: canada\n17. Row 53: canada\n18. Row 54: canada\n19. Row 55: canada\n20. Row 57: canada\n21. Row 58: canada\n22. Row 59: czechoslovakia (different country)\n23. Row 60: canada\n24. Row 61: canada\n25. Row 62: united states\n\n26. In the \"nationality\" column we have seen that there are indeed more countries than just United States, but we still need to verify if this player list has exactly 5 from \"united states\".\n\n27. From step 6 and onwards we saw that there is no row with the \"united states\" label in the nationality column.\n\n28. Now we know that 4 of the players were from the United States, so let's go back to our claim and assume it is false since it says exactly 5 be from united state but we only found 4 players who are from this country.\n\n\n\nHere's a JSON output with the chain of thought:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if there are any other countries besides United States in the player list\",\n      \"text\": \"Look for rows that have a different value in the \\\"nationality\\\" column\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Assume there is no row with the \\\"United States\\\" label in the nationality column\",\n      \"text\": \"Given the lack of information we cannot determine if it's true or false but given the claim stated that exactly 5 be from united state let us assume the opposite in order to complete the task.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check how many total players are there that are not \\\"United States\\\" from the \\\"nationality\\\" column\",\n      \"text\": \"Look at every row and count how many times a different nationality appears\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find out how many player are from United States and other countries\",\n      \"text\": \"We have identified 4 players from the United States, but we need to check if there are exactly 5 players from the United States in total.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 46,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 50,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 56,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 62,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We will go through each player's row in the table and check if their corresponding value in the \"college / junior / club team\" column contains the words \"whl\".\n3. If we find any row where this condition is true, we can say that at least one player comes from the WHL Hockey League.\n4. We will count how many rows meet this condition.\n5. Since there are 63 players in total, if only 4 of them come from the WHL Hockey League, then our claim can be said to be false.\n\nNow let's find out which players come from the WHL hockey league.\n\nStep 1:\nThe relevant cells that indicate player's junior leagues are rows 43, 45, 55 and 59.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers made 6 picks in the range show. To verify this, we need to identify all the players selected by the Philadelphia Flyers from the table.\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant cells\nWe will focus on rows where the NHL team is \"Philadelphia Flyers\". This means we are interested in rows 43 and 47, as these are the only two rows where the team matches this condition.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers made 6 picks in the range show.\",\n    \"We will check if row 43 (David McLay) is indeed a pick by the Philadelphia Flyers.\",\n    \"We also need to verify if row 47 (John Stevens) is another pick by the same team.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\nAfter examining rows 43 and 47, we see that both are indeed players picked by the Philadelphia Flyers. However, this does not necessarily mean they were selected in a \"range show\", which is an event where teams pick multiple players consecutively based on their order of selection.\n\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the information given in the table and understanding what a \"range show\" entails, we cannot confirm if these picks occurred during such an event. Therefore, without further details about the event structure or the team's draft process, we cannot definitively say the Philadelphia Flyers made 6 consecutive picks.",
