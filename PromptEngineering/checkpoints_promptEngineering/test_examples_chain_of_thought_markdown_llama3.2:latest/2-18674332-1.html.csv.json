The difference between November 19 and December 10 is 17 days (December 3 is the first day of the next month).\n6. Since 17 days does not equal 1 week (7 days), it seems unlikely that the two games are one week apart, but further analysis is needed to confirm.\n7. However, looking at the table again, we can see that both games were played on different weeks. The first game was played during week 15 and second game was played in week 16 for the Lions and week 15 for the Buccaneers respectively.\n8.
