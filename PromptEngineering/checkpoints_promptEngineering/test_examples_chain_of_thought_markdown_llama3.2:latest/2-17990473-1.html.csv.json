To verify this claim, we will look for the row in the table that matches both conditions:\n   - `result` is 'w 27 - 21' \n   - `attendance` is '70012'\n   - `opponent` should match with \"Oakland Raiders\".\n\n3. Looking at the table data, we can find a match by examining each row.\n   The 11th row in the table has: \n   * `week` = 11\n   * `date` = November 22 , 1999\n   * `opponent` = Oakland Raiders\n   * `result` = w 27 - 21\n   * `attendance` = 70012\n\n4.
