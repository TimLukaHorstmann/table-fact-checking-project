This can be found by subtracting the total number of lost games from 103 (the total number of games played) because all-time is represented in row 19.\n\n3. **Find the Number of Wins for Frank McGuire**: Frank McGuire's team won 142 games according to the information provided in column `lost` and row 16 in the table.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Games Played by Frank McGuire**: Since Frank McGuire coached from 1964-1980, we can calculate his total number of games played as follows: The years range from 1964 to 1980. This means he coached for a total of 16 seasons (from row 15 to row 30). As each season represents one year in the table and has an average of five games per season, we multiply the number of seasons by 5.\n\n5. **Compare Frank McGuire's Wins with Other Coaches**: We can determine if Frank McGuire holds the record for most wins by comparing his total number of wins to that of other coaches who have played more than one season (as calculated in step 4).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: If Frank McGuire has more wins than any coach listed in row index 16 or lower, then we can conclude that he indeed is the coach with the most wins.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns for Final Answer**: The answer to whether Frank McGuire holds the record for the most win can be found by comparing his wins (in column \"lost\") to other coaches' wins in rows 15 through 19.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, this does not confirm that Frank Martin is indeed the only one still coaching. Instead, we must verify if there's any other coach whose last season began after 2012.\n\n5. **Verify Frank Martin\u2019s position in the table**: As per the claim, he should be the only active coach at the moment, which means any other row with a similar 'lost' or 'pct' column might have a different time frame for their coaching career.
