    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the claim to be verified\nThe claim is \"the opponent in 2005 was Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova, and in Rome in 2003, the opponent was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\"\n\n### Step 2: Extract relevant information from the table for year 2005\nFor the year 2005:\n- Outcome: Winner\n- Championship: Miami (hard)\n- Partner: Alicia Molik\n- Opponents: Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs\n\nThis matches the claim that the opponent in 2005 was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the claim for year 2003 and Rome\nFor the year 2003 and Rome:\n- Outcome: Winner\n- Championship: Rome (clay)\n- Partner: Martina Navratilova\n- Opponents: Jelena Doki\u0107, Nadia Petrova\n\nThis matches part of the claim that in Rome in 2003, the opponent was indeed a combination of two players.\n\n### Step 4: Assess if both opponents listed for 2005 are correct\nThe table lists Nadia Petrova as an opponent in the year 2005 match against Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs. The claim lists Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova, but since Jelena Doki\u0107 is not an opponent in any of the provided 2005 matches, it seems there might be a mistake or misinterpretation regarding Jelena Doki\u0107 in this context.\n\n### Step 5: Assess if both opponents listed for Rome in 2003 are correct\nThe table lists Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova as opponents in the year 2003 match against Martina Navratilova. The claim correctly lists these two players as opponents in Rome in 2003.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the overall truth of the claim based on the analysis\nGiven that part of the claim is verified (the opponent in 2005 was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs) and another part has a discrepancy regarding Jelena Doki\u0107, the claim cannot be entirely confirmed as true without further clarification or correction.\n\n### Step 7: Output the final answer in JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be verified\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"cell_match\": [\n        \"Outcome: Winner\",\n        \"Championship: Miami (hard)\",\n        \"Partner: Alicia Molik\",\n        \"Opponents: Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs\"\n      ],\n      \"description\": \"Extract relevant information from the table for year 2005 and verify it matches the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"cell_match\": [\n        \"Outcome: Winner\",\n        \"Championship: Rome (clay)\",\n        \"Partner: Martina Navratilova\",\n        \"Opponents: Jelena Doki\u0107, Nadia Petrova\"\n      ],\n      \"description\": \"Verify the claim for year 2003 and Rome matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"reasoning_note\": \"Potential error in listing opponents for 2005 match against Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"cell_match\": [\n        \"Outcome: Runner-up\",\n        \"Championship: Indian Wells (hard)\",\n        \"Partner: Elena Likhovtseva\",\n        \"Opponents: Virginia Ruano Pascual, Paola Su\u00e1rez\"\n      ],\n      \"description\": \"Additional context not directly relevant to the claim's verification but clarifying opponent combinations\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"reasoning_note\": \"Claim cannot be confirmed as true due to discrepancy and potential error regarding Jelena Doki\u0107 in 2005's opponent listing\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. To verify the claim, we need to check if the partner for Martina Navratilova was indeed correct in both 2003 at the Toronto Championship and 2004 at the Indian Wells Championship.\n2. From the table, we can see that in 2003, the partner for Martina Navratilova at the Rome Championship is listed as \"jelena doki\u0107 nadia petrova\", not Lisa Raymond.\n3. In contrast, the table states that the partner for Martina Navratilova at the Toronto Championship in 2003 was indeed Lisa Raymond.\n4. Moving on to 2004, we can see that the partner for Elena Likhovtseva (not Martina Navratilova) at the Indian Wells Championship is listed as \"virginia ruano pascual paola su\u00e1rez\".\n5. Again, in contrast, the table states that the partner for Martina Navratilova at the Indian Wells Championship in 2004 was indeed Martina Navratilova.\n6. Since we have found a discrepancy between what the claim states and what the table actually says (i.e., Lisa Raymond as the partner for Martina Navratilova at the Toronto Championship in 2003, but not at the Indian Wells Championship), the chain of thought is:\n \n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"step1: Claim about the claim stated that the partner for Martina Navratilova was correct at the Toronto Championship in 2003 and Indian Wells Championship in 2004.\",\n    \"step2: The table states that in 2003, the partner for Martina Navratilova at the Rome Championship is listed as \\\"jelena doki\u0107 nadia petrova\\\", not Lisa Raymond.\",\n    \"step3: In contrast, the table states that the partner for Martina Navratilova at the Toronto Championship in 2003 was indeed Lisa Raymond.\",\n    \"step4: Moving on to 2004, we can see that the partner for Elena Likhovtseva (not Martina Navratilova) at the Indian Wells Championship is listed as \\\"virginia ruano pascual paola su\u00e1rez\\\".\",\n    \"step5: Again, in contrast, the table states that the partner for Martina Navratilova at the Indian Wells Championship in 2004 was indeed Martina Navratilova.\",\n    \"step6: Since we have found a discrepancy between what the claim states and what the table actually says, the chain of thought concludes that the claim is False.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
