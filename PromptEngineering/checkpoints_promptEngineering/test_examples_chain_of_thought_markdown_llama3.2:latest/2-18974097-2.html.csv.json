Next, we need to verify if there are exactly two schools with this classification.\n   - To do this, we will look at the number of schools that have a \"aaa\" classification and compare it to the claim that there are only 2 such schools.\n   - There is one other school besides Mitchell's in the table that has an IHSAA class of AAA: mitchell.\n\n3. We now need to confirm that no other schools besides these two are classified as AA.\n   - This can be checked by examining each school listed under \"ihsaa class\" and verifying if they match the claim.\n   - There are multiple schools with an AA classification, however this is not directly relevant to our answer but it confirms we should look only at AAA for the 2-schools claim.\n\n4. If two schools indeed exist in the list as per point 1 and their IHSAA class matches \"aaa\" from step 2 (which was confirmed), then the statement can be considered true.\n   - Based on step 3, there is more than one AA classification not relevant to this problem but it shows there's no other AAA besides mitchell.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"Mitchell has an IHSAA class of 'aaa'\"},\n    {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"There is only one other school with the same classification ('aaa')\"},\n    {\"step\": 3, \"description\": \"There are multiple schools with an AA classification, but it confirms our focus should be on AAA for this problem\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to determine the size of Orleans and Mitchell schools from the table.\n2. The size of Orleans school is 258 (in the \"size\" column) and the size of Mitchell school is 620 (in the \"size\" column).\n3. Next, we calculate half the size of Mitchell by dividing its size by 2: 620 / 2 = 310.\n4. Now, we compare the size of Orleans to half the size of Mitchell: 258 < 310\n5. If true, then Orleans is less than half the size of Mitchell.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n  ]\n}",
