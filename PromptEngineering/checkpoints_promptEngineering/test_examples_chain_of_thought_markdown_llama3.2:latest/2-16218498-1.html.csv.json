We will then compare these values to determine which team has the lowest value.\n3. If we find a team with an aggregate score that is lower than the current lowest score, we update our answer to TRUE.\n4. If not, we continue searching for a team with a lower score until we have checked all teams.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the values of `agg` are as follows:\n- botswana defence force xi: 1 - 2 = 3\n- arsenal (maseru): 4 - 0 = 4\n- cd el\u00e1 nguema: 2 - 6 = 8\n- lprc oilers: 2 - 3 = 5\n- asc police: 2 - 2 = 4 (but also has a higher score of 5 in another row)\n- port autonome: 0 - 0 = 0\n- saint - george sa: 2 - 4 = 6\n- saint - louis fc: 2 - 7 = 9\n- sahel sc: 4 - 2 = 6\n- tourbillon fc: 1 - 1 = 2\n\nThe lowest `agg` score is 0, which belongs to the team port autonome.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{\n\"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"list all values of agg\",\n    \"compare these values to determine which team has the lowest value\",\n    \"check all teams\"\n],\n\"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n]",
