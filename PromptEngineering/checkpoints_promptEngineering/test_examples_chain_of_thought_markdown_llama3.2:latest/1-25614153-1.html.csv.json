Compare this count to the total number of songs in the album.\n\nHere's how I'd reason step by step:\n\n- The table only lists one support vocalist for each song, and that is never Darlene Zschech.\n- In fact, when looking at column 'supporting vocal', it can be observed that there are always two artists listed as \"none\" in the majority of songs. This suggests a common pattern in all songs but indicates that Darlene Zschech does not appear in any row of the table.\n- There is only one instance where Darlene Zschech appears in column 'supporting vocal'. She doesn't have an artist listed with her, so this actually means she never had to share her role as support vocalist for the album. The actual information indicates that she has no co-support vocals listed, which can be verified by simply looking at row 6 of the table.\n- Counting the total number of songs in the table is irrelevant because Darlene Zschech was never used as a support vocalist according to our data analysis.\n- Comparing this count to the total number of songs is also not necessary. The fact that Darlene Zschech has no support vocals means the claim must be false.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"supporting vocal\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"supporting vocal\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that 5 songs on the album \"Con Todo\" come from an original album called \"This Is Our God\".\n2. First, we need to find out how many songs are actually on the album \"Con Todo\". Looking at the table, we can see that there is only one song with the title \"Con Todo\", which is not directly related to our claim.\n3. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that there are two other songs with titles containing \"Con Todo\": \"Desde mi interior\" and \"Poderoso para salvar\". These songs might be related to our claim because they have a similar title structure.\n4. Next, let's look at the column for the original album, which is located in the same row as each song title. We can see that the songs \"Con Todo\", \"Desde mi interior\", and \"Poderoso para salvar\" all come from the original album \"This Is Our God\".\n5. However, we still need to determine if there are three more songs on the album \"Con Todo\" that also come from the same original album.\n6. Upon re-examining the table again, we notice that none of the other song titles contain \"Con Todo\". Therefore, it is likely that only these three songs (\"Con Todo\", \"Desde mi interior\", and \"Poderoso para salvar\") are related to our claim.\n\nNow let's output a final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"original album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"con todo\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"poderoso para salvar\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Unnamed: 0\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original album\"}\n  ]\n}",

Since there are a total of 13 songs on the album \"con todo\", we need to check if all songs with duration >= 7 minutes were correctly counted.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the completeness of the count\nUpon re-examining the data, it is clear that not all songs over 7 minutes are listed. For instance, Row 4 (\"desde mi interior\") and Row 9 (\"soy libre\") do meet the criteria. Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that two more entries also qualify.\n\n### Step 6: Correct the count to reflect the full set of qualifying songs\nCorrecting the oversight means recognizing that there are indeed 7 entries in the table exceeding or meeting the duration requirement.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Start by examining the claim about the album \\\"con todo\\\" and identifying relevant information from the provided table.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"Unnamed: 0\", \"song\", \"original album\", \"composer\", \"worship leader\", \"duration\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Locate the duration column to identify songs over 7 minutes in length.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"duration\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Count how many of these entries have a duration greater than or equal to 7 minutes, and determine if all qualifying songs were correctly listed.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"Unnamed: 0\", \"song\", \"duration\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{TRUE}$",

Looking at the table, the original album is mentioned for each song. We can identify these albums by looking at the columns that contain this information.\n3. The relevant columns are:\n   - `original album`\n   - `composer` (which in some cases also mentions the original album)\n4. From the table, we see that songs 1, 2, 8, and 13 have \"This Is Our God\" mentioned as their original album.\n5. This means at least four songs on the album come from this specific album.\n6. However, the claim states that only one song comes from an original album called \"This Is Our God\", which contradicts our observation of multiple songs sharing the same original album name.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant columns in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Look for songs that have their original album as \\\"This Is Our God\\\"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count how many songs share this original album name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare the count to the claim's assertion that only one song comes from \\\"This Is Our God\\\"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"original album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"original album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"original album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"original album\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
