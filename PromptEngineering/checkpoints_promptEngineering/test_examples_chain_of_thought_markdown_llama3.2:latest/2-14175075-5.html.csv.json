Locate the sport with the latest date: Since we're asked about softball, we need to find the row for the \"softball\" sport and verify that it has the latest date among all sports in the table.\n\n3. Find the relevant rows for softball: Looking at the table, there is only one row where the sport is listed as \"softball\", which is on April 1, 2008.\n\n4. Check if April 1, 2008 is the latest date among all sports: We need to verify that the date in this softball row (April 1, 2008) is indeed the latest among all dates in the table.\n\n5. Compare with other dates: Other relevant dates for comparison are:\n   - December 9, 2007 (wrestling): This date is earlier than April 1, 2008.\n   - March 7, 2008 (gymnastics): This date is also earlier than April 1, 2008.\n   - February 22, 2008 (gymnastics) and other dates: These are even earlier.\n\n6. Conclusion: Since there are no later dates for softball compared to the latest found so far (which isn't actually needed since we've already established the sport's row is not among the earliest), the claim that \"softball be the sport with the latest date\" can only be true if all other sports do not have a later date than April 1, 2008. However, given our search for softball shows us there are no dates beyond April 1, 2008 in any row we need to compare it against for this task.\n\n### Final Answer JSON:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the column for sport:** We need to find which sports are mentioned in the table.\n   The relevant cells for this step are:\n   - `row_index`: 0\n   - `column_name`: \"sport\"\n   ```\n{\n  \"row_index\": 0,\n  \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n}\n```\n\n2. **Extract dates that occurred in 2008:** We need to determine which sport has the latest date in the year 2008.\n   The relevant cells for this step are:\n   - `row_index`: Any row where the date falls within 2008 (we will find these later)\n   - `column_name`: \"date\"\n   ```\n{\n  \"row_index\": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],\n  \"column_name\": \"date\"\n}\n```\n\n3. **Find the sport with the latest date in 2008:** We need to find which row has a later date than all others in 2008.\n   First, we need to extract dates from 2008:\n   - `row_index`: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n   - `column_name`: \"date\"\n   ```\n{\n  \"row_index\": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],\n  \"column_name\": \"date\"\n}\n```\n\n4. **Extract the date from each row in 2008:** Now that we know which rows correspond to dates in 2008, let's extract these specific values:\n   - `row_index`: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n   - `column_name`: \"date\"\n   ```\n{\n  \"row_index\": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],\n  \"column_name\": \"date\",\n  \"dates_in_2008\": [\n    \"september 8 , 2007\",\n    \"november 10 , 2007\",\n    \"december 5 , 2007\",\n    \"december 7 , 2007\",\n    \"december 8 , 2007\",\n    \"february 22 , 2008\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n5. **Find the latest date in 2008:** Determine which of these dates is the most recent.\n   Looking at these, `february 22 , 2008` is later than the others.\n   The relevant cells for this step are:\n   - `row_index`: 6\n   - `column_name`: \"date\"\n   ```\n{\n  \"row_index\": 6,\n  \"column_name\": \"date\",\n  \"latest_date_in_2008\": \"february 22 , 2008\"\n}\n```\n\n6. **Check if the sport for that date is wrestling:** We must confirm that the sport corresponding to this date is indeed 'wrestling'.\n   Looking at `row_index`: 7 and column_name: \"sport\" gives us:\n   ```\n{\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"sport\",\n  \"latest_date_sport\": \"wrestling\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],\n      \"column_name\": \"date\",\n      \"dates_in_2008\": [\n        \"september 8 , 2007\",\n        \"november 10 , 2007\",\n        \"december 5 , 2007\",\n        \"december 7 , 2007\",\n        \"december 8 , 2007\",\n        \"february 22 , 2008\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\",\n      \"latest_date_in_2008\": \"february 22 , 2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\",\n      \"latest_date_sport\": \"wrestling\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\",\n      \"latest_date_in_2008\": \"february 22 , 2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\",\n      \"latest_date_sport\": \"wrestling\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
