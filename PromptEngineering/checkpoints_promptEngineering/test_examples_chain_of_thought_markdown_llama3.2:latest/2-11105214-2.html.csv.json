We need to check if every constituency has \"snp 's place 2003\" as its 2nd column value.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that for each constituency, the \"snp 's place 2003\" is indeed listed as the second-to-last column (except for row 1 and 10 which do not have this information).\n4. However, the claim requires the 2nd value in the \"snp 's place 2003\" column to be exactly \"2nd\".\n5. Rows 8-11 do show a value of \"2nd\", but rows 1 and 9 and 10 actually have values for their SNP places but with an \"n/a\" entry.\n6. Despite this, none of the constituencies listed as having SNP 's place 2003 in row 1 or row 10 have the second cell's value marked down to \"2nd\".\n7. For the remaining rows, all but one (row 4) indeed show a value for their SNP places with \"n/a\" entry.\n8. Only in Row 4 do we see an actual SNP 's place 2003 value of \"2nd\".  \n9. In row 11 as well, there is an actual SNP 's place 2003 value of \"2nd\".\n10.

This means we need to find the smallest value in the \"swing to gain\" column (column D) for the year 2007.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the relevant cells\nLooking at the table, the \"swing to gain\" column contains values that are not present for all parties. The only party with a swing percentage of 0.17 is the Conservative Party in constituency Galloway & Upper Nithsdale (rank 1). Therefore, we need to check if this value is the lowest among those mentioned.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the value with other relevant values\nComparing the swing percentage of 0.17 for the Conservative Party in Galloway & Upper Nithsdale (rank 1) with the values in the \"swing to gain\" column for other constituencies, we find that all other swing percentages mentioned are greater than 0.17.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nSince there is no lower value of swing percentage than 0.17 in any of the relevant cells (Galloway & Upper Nithsdale), and considering that a \"hold\" implies no change (i.e., the party remains in the same position), it can be inferred that the swing percentages mentioned are for changes from other parties to Labour, not the Conservative Party directly.\n\nHowever, there is one case where the swing percentage of 0.17 occurs: in constituency Galloway & Upper Nithsdale for the Conservative Party (rank 1) in the year 2003.
