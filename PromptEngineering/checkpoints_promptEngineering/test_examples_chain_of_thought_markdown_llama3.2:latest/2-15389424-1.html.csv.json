We can do this by looking at the \"lost\" column in the table. Specifically, we will compare the number of losses for Minas Gerais with other teams.\n3. The relevant cells are:\n   - `row_index` 7\n   - `column_name`: lost\n4. According to the table, Minas Gerais has 10 losses. We need to check if any other team has more than 10 losses.\n\n### Relevant Table Cells:\n\n| row_index | column_name          |\n|-----------:|----------------------|\n|         2 | drawn               |\n|         3 | lost                |\n|         4 | lost                |\n|         5 | lost                |\n|         6 | lost                |\n|         7 | lost                |\n|         8 | lost                |\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Minas Gerais has 10 losses. However, Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP also has 3 losses, and AA das Palmeiras has 7 losses. Neither of these teams has more losses than Minas Gerais.\n\nHowever, looking at position 8: \"aa s\u00e3o bento lost\" we can see that this team has 11 losses which is actually higher than the amount of losses the other team has (AA das palmeiras and Minas gerais). Therefore we conclude that this claim is FALSE.\n\n\n\n### JSON Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant cells are row_index 8, column_name lost. According to the table, AA S\\u00e3o Bento has 11 losses, which is higher than the amount of losses the other team (AA das Palmeiras and Minas Gerais) have. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's find the number of drawn games for each team.\n   - For Paulistano: `drawn` cell in row 4 = 2\n   - For S\u00edrio: `drawn` cell in row 3 = 4\n\n2. Now, we need to compare these values. If Paulistano drew as many games as S\u00edrio, then the difference should be zero.\n   - The difference between drawn games of Paulistano and S\u00edrio is `4 - 2 = 2`. This means that Paulistano did not draw as many games as S\u00edrio.\n\n3. Since the difference is not zero, we can conclude that the claim \"paulistano lost as many game as s\u00edrio draw\" is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Find the number of drawn games for each team.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Compare these values and calculate the difference.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion based on comparison\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
