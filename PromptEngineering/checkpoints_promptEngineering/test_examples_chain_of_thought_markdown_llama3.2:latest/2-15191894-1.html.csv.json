    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that Benny Friedman of Michigan played the quarterback position, while Edward L. McMillan of Princeton played the center position.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant data points in the table**:\n   - To verify the claim about Benny Friedman playing quarterback for Michigan, we need to look at the row with \"quarterback\" as the value in the \"name\" column and \"michigan\" as the value in the \"school\" column.\n   - To verify the claim about Edward L. McMillan playing center for Princeton, we need to look at the row with \"center\" as the value in the \"position\" column and \"princeton\" as the value in the \"school\" column.\n\n3. **Check the data points**:\n   - For Benny Friedman: The row with \"quarterback\" as the position value and \"michigan\" as the school value is found, confirming that he played quarterback for Michigan.\n   - For Edward L. McMillan: The row with \"center\" as the position value but no match in the school column can be confusing, since there's a \"no\" on both lines when considering his entry as center (meaning we're looking at other aspects). However, if we strictly follow the provided claim without further context about why \"princeton\" should not apply to the center role for McMillan, it suggests an error in how the table is interpreted based on the given instructions. \n\n4. **Conclusion**: The initial interpretation of the data shows that Benny Friedman played quarterback for Michigan, but there's a contradiction with the claim about Edward L. McMillan due to misinterpretation of his row as center.\n\n5. **Adjust Conclusion Based on Strict Interpretation**:\n   - Upon further review, recognizing an oversight in the initial step-by-step reasoning where I didn't clarify why \"princeton\" was mistakenly considered as not fitting for a center position based solely on its presence without context, the error lies more fundamentally with how we approach the claim about McMillan rather than a factual mismatch of his row. Therefore, strictly speaking, Edward L. McMillan's entry does indeed match the criteria provided by the table for someone playing \"center\" at Princeton.\n\n6. **Finalize Conclusion**:\n   - Given that there is no direct factual error in the data provided but an oversight in interpreting \"no\" and \"yes/no\" correctly across multiple lines for McMillan, the correct interpretation of the claim as per the provided instructions should focus on factual accuracy regarding position roles without misinterpreting \"unanimous,\" \"no,\" or \"yes/no\" across different lines. Thus, the strict adherence to table content reveals that Benny Friedman indeed played quarterback and Edward L. McMillan played center for their respective schools.\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The claim states that Friedman plays fullback, which means we need to check if there is any record of Benny Friedman playing fullback in the table.\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there is a row for \"fullback\" with a name \"ernie big dog nevers\". This suggests that there is no evidence that Friedman played fullback.\n3. Next, we need to check if McMillan plays quarterback. According to the claim, this should be true if Friedman does not play fullback and the other conditions are met.\n4. Looking at the table again, we see that there is a row for \"quarterback\" with a name \"benny friedman\". However, we also need to check if McMillan plays quarterback when considering all other parts of the claim as TRUE (unanimous yes on tackles and halfbacks).\n5. Given that there's no unanimous yes on tackles and halfbacks and there are rows for both tackle and quarterback players which include McMillan under different player roles, we can infer that while McMillan plays under two roles he does not exclusively play only one of them as required by the claim.\n6.
