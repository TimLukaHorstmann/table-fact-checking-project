    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's find the dates of the Spanish Grand Prix and the South African Grand Prix.\n   The date for the Spanish Grand Prix is 12 May, and the date for the South African Grand Prix is 01 January.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the gap between these two dates in months and days.\n   To do this, we'll convert both dates to a format that's easy to work with (days since epoch).\n   However, as this data is historical, it isn't actually available. So instead, we can simply perform the calculation manually:\n   January has 31 days, so from 01 January to the end of January is 30 days.\n   February has 28 or 29 days, but for simplicity, let's assume a non-leap year (which is what most historical Grand Prix dates would fall under).\n   So, from the end of January to the end of February is 28 days.\n   March has 31 days, so from the end of February to the end of March is 31 days.\n   April has 30 days, so from the end of March to the end of April is 30 days.\n   May has 31 days, so from the end of April to the end of May is 31 days.\n\n   Total days in these four months is: 30 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 119\n\n   Since the Spanish Grand Prix was on 12 May, and we've already accounted for the first four months, there are now only 11 days left until the end of May.\n   Therefore, the gap between 01 January and 12 May is 119 + 11 = 130 days.\n\n3. Next, let's look at the dates for the South African Grand Prix (01 January) and the Spanish Grand Prix (12 May).\n   The given claim states that the Spanish Grand Prix is 4 months and 11 days after the South African Grand Prix.\n\n4. Since we've already calculated this gap to be 130 days, let's compare it with the claim.\n   If the claim were true, then 130 days should equal 4 months and 11 days.\n   \n5. Now, let's convert both times into a format that can be compared (days).\n   Four months is equivalent to 1 * 30 + 1 * 31 + 1 * 28 + 1 * 31 = 120 days.\n   Eleven days will be added on top of this, so we get: 120 + 11 = 131 days.\n\n6. Comparing the calculated gap (130 days) with the claim's gap (131 days), they are not equal.\n\n7. Therefore, since the calculated gap is less than the claimed gap, the claim cannot be true.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"find dates for Spanish Grand Prix and South African Grand Prix\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"calculate gap between these two dates in months and days\",\n      \"result\": 130\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"convert both times into a format that can be compared (days)\",\n      \"claim\": \"131\",\n      \"calculated\": \"130\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"compare the calculated gap with the claim's gap\",\n      \"result\": \"they are not equal.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"since the calculated gap is less than the claimed gap, the claim cannot be true.\",\n      \"result\": \"the claim cannot be true\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Compare this count with the total number of races in the table.\n\nNow, let's list the results for each step:\n\n- Step 1: \n    The British Grand Prix was not won by a constructor affiliate with Ford (it was won by Lotus - Ford). All other races were won by a constructor affiliate with Ford. Thus we can identify the following winners: Spanish Grand Prix (Lotus-Ford), Monaco Grand Prix (Lotus - Ford), Belgian Grand Prix (Mclaren - Ford), Dutch Grand Prix (Matra - Ford), Italian Grand Prix was not won by Matra - Ford (but only G) but Matra affiliate had won one race and other affiliates like Ferrari who were not with ford also won, so lets assume it is not the case. French grand prix was won by jacky ickx who was driving for ferrari ,so its not included here . canadian grand prix was not won by Mclaren - Ford (G) but rather by Mclaren affiliate,  United states grand prix was not won by matra - ford (D) but Jack Stewarts was a Matra - Ford Driver and so is the case with mexican grand prix.\n\n    So only Spanish Grand Prix was won by an affiliate of Ford who's construction was Lotus-Ford. Thus for now, we can say that this constructor affiliate has won 1 race.\n\n- Step 2: \n   The French Grand Prix was not won by a constructor affiliate with Ford (it was won by Ferrari).\n\n- Step 3:\n   Since there are a total of 15 races in the table, and we have identified only 1 race where an affiliate with Ford was the winner, it is not true that this constructor affiliate has won all but 2 races.\n\n- Step 4: \n   As stated above we found out the number of wins for the relevant constructor.

List relevant cells in the table to support our reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify Chris Amon's pole positions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if Chris Amon has 3 consecutive pole positions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Evaluate the claim based on our findings\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"pole position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"pole position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output shows the reasoning steps, the final answer as JSON, and the relevant cells from the table that support our reasoning.",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that the person with the fastest lap will always be the same as the winning driver.\n2. To verify this, we need to examine the table for each race and check if there is a match between the winner and the fastest lap driver.\n3. We can start by looking at the first row of the table: south african grand prix.\n4. The fastest lap driver in this row is Jim Clark, who won the race as well.\n5. This suggests that the claim may be true for some races.\n6. However, we need to examine all rows to confirm if there are any instances where the winner and the fastest lap driver are different.\n7. Let's move on to the next row: spanish grand prix.\n8. The fastest lap driver in this row is Jean-Pierre Beltoise, but Graham Hill won the race.\n9. This shows that the claim may not be true for all races.\n10. We need to examine the rest of the rows to see if there are any instances where the winner and the fastest lap driver match or don't match.\n\n#### Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"The claim states that the person with the fastest lap will always be the same as the winning driver.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"To verify this, we need to examine the table for each race and check if there is a match between the winner and the fastest lap driver.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"We can start by looking at the first row of the table: south african grand prix.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"The fastest lap driver in this row is Jim Clark, who won the race as well.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"This suggests that the claim may be true for some races.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"However, we need to examine all rows to confirm if there are any instances where the winner and the fastest lap driver are different.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Let's move on to the next row: spanish grand prix.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"The fastest lap driver in this row is Jean-Pierre Beltoise, but Graham Hill won the race.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 9,\n      \"description\": \"This shows that the claim may not be true for all races.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 10,\n      \"description\": \"We need to examine the rest of the rows to see if there are any instances where the winner and the fastest lap driver match or don't match.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
