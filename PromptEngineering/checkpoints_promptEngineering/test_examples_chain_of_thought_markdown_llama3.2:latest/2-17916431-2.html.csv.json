This will be our second metric.\n5. **Compare the metrics**: If both metrics (number of tied games and number of 5-0 games) are greater than or equal to 3, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given data:\n\n**Step 1: Identify games with 0 - 0 result**\n\nRelevant cells:\n* row_index 2, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 0'\n* row_index 11, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 0'\n* row_index 21, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 0'\n* row_index 26, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 0'\n* row_index 27, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 1' (exclude)\n* row_index 28, column_name \"result\" = '2 - 0' (exclude)\n* row_index 31, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 0'\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of tied games**\n\nThere are 5 games with a tie.\n\n**Step 3: Identify games with 5 - 0 result**\n\nRelevant cells:\n* row_index 35, column_name \"result\" = '5 - 0'\n* row_index 36, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 3' (exclude)\n* row_index 39, column_name \"result\" = '0 - 1' (exclude)\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of 5-0 games**\n\nThere are 2 games with a margin of five goals.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the metrics**\n\nThe claim states that exactly 3 of the games should end with a tie and 3 games should have a result of 5 - 0. Based on our count, there are 5 tied games (not 3) and 2 games with a margin of five goals (not 3). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify games with 0 - 0 result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of tied games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Identify games with 5 - 0 result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of 5-0 games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Compare the metrics\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
