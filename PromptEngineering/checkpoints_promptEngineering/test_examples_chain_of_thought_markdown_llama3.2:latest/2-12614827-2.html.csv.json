    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that Rob Emerson has the highest win record of 13 - 10 in his MMA career.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check the table for the number of wins and losses recorded by each fighter.\n3. We will start by checking the row with \"res\" = \"win\" and \"record\" = \"13 - 10 (1)\" which corresponds to Rob Emerson's record.\n4. Since there is only one instance where Rob Emerson has a win record of 13-10, we need to verify that he indeed has this highest win record in his MMA career.\n\n#### Relevance of Table Cells:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"res\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"record\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n5. Now, we need to compare Rob Emerson's record with the records of other fighters in the table.\n6. We will iterate through each row and check if there are any other instances where a fighter has a higher win record than Rob Emerson.\n7. After checking all rows, we can conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n\n#### Relevance of Table Cells (continued):\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"record\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"record\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"record\"\n  },\n  // ... other rows ...\n]\n```\n\n8. Upon reviewing all records, we find that there is indeed another fighter with a higher win record.\n9. For example, in row 2, the fighter has a win record of 12-10 (1), which is higher than Rob Emerson's 13-10.\n\n#### Relevance of Table Cells (continued):\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"record\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 9,\n    \"column_name\": \"record\"\n  },\n  // ... other rows ...\n]\n```\n\n10. We conclude that the claim is FALSE, as there is another fighter with a higher win record.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify the claim that Rob Emerson has the highest win record of 13 - 10 in his MMA career.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check Rob Emerson's record for the number of wins and losses.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare Rob Emerson's record with other fighters' records to see if there is a higher record.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"res\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Counting these, we find that there is only one match against him with a decision (split).\n4. **Check Other Opponents' Decision (Split) Matches:** We need to see if other opponents have 3 more matches with decision (split) method.\n5. **Count Decision (Split) Matches for Ourselves and Other Opponents:** Checking all rows, we find that there are indeed 4 instances of decision (split), but one instance does not involve Eric Reynolds. The second row involving Eric Reynolds is actually a win against Rodney Rhoden with tko (punches).\n6. **Conclusion Based on Count:** Since we found only 1 match for Eric Reynolds and three more matches involving other opponents also had decision (split) method, it means the claim is false.\n\n#### Final JSON Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",

Since we're looking for a specific claim about not playing at UFC 87, we can focus on rows related to this event. We find that there's no relevant information about Rob Emerson in the winning row.\n\n#### Step 3: Look for the row with \"res\" as \"loss\" and check the event name\nWe search for a row in the table where the \"res\" column value is \"loss\". Since we're looking for a specific claim about not playing at UFC 87, we can focus on rows related to this event. We find that there's a row with a loss, but it does not indicate Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if the table provides any information about Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87\nWe cannot find any information in the table that suggests Rob Emerson fought at UFC 87. However, we need to ensure that there is no other row indicating a loss or draw for Rob Emerson in this event.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify that the claim is not true because of an absence of data\nSince the table does not provide explicit information about Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87, and considering he was indeed involved in the card as indicated by his record (win-loss), but we don't have any direct connection to event UFC 87 from the provided table that we can draw upon for conclusive evidence either way. However, we can verify that there is no loss or draw entry with a specific date for Rob Emerson at this event.\n\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze other events to confirm absence at UFC 87\nTo completely validate the claim, let's see if Rob Emerson was involved in any other UFC events which could prove he didn't participate in UFC 87. Since we cannot see every single result of him in UFC that would show absence from UFC 87 but we do know there is no entry for a loss or draw specifically at this event which would mean he either fought there and won, lost by decision, had the fight go to a draw (no contest), or was involved in some other capacity.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nSince there's no direct information about Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87, but also because the table entries do not show any evidence of him losing a fight against another competitor on this date which would have confirmed he did participate. Therefore we can reasonably say that since there is absolutely no record to confirm or deny, our knowledge of his participation in UFC 87 relies solely upon absence of data.\n\n\n\n#### Step-by-step reasoning as required\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Analyzing table for Rob Emerson's performance at UFC 87\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Looking for relevant row with 'res' as 'win'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Looking for relevant row with 'res' as 'loss'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Verifying absence of information in table about Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Analyzing other events to confirm absence at UFC 87\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": -1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
