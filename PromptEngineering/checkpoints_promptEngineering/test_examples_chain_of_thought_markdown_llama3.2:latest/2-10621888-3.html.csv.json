    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the total run time of all episodes:\n   The total run time can be found by adding up the individual episode run times.\n\n2. The formula for average is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this case, we need to calculate the sum of the \"run time\" column and then divide it by the total number of rows (episodes).\n\n3. Since the claim states that the average run time is 5:25, we can set up an equation using the formula for average:\n   Average = Sum of all values / Number of values\n\n4. We know that the sum of all values (run times) divided by the number of values should be equal to 5:25. However, since there are different time formats in the table, we need to convert them into a uniform format for easier calculation.\n\n5. After converting the run times into hours and minutes, we can calculate their total sum:\n   Sum = (6+7) + (4+16)/60 + (5+49)/60 + (4+59)/60 + (5+48)/60 + (4+59)/60 + (5+51)/60 + (5+4)/60 + (6+13)/60 + (5+52)/60 + (6+31)/60 + (5+1)/60\n   Sum \u2248 12.33 hours\n\n6. Since the table has 13 episodes, we can divide this sum by the number of rows to find the average run time in hours and minutes:\n   Average \u2248 0.95 hours or 57 minutes\n\n7. Comparing our calculated average (57 minutes) with the claimed average (5:25), we see that they are not equal.\n\n8. Therefore, since our calculation does not match the claim, we can conclude that the statement \"the average run time for all episodes is 5:25\" is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"episode number\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"podcast date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"run time\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"run time\", \"value\": 0.95},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"run time\", \"value\": 6.07},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"run time\", \"value\": 4.16},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\", \"value\": 4.49}\n  ]\n}",
