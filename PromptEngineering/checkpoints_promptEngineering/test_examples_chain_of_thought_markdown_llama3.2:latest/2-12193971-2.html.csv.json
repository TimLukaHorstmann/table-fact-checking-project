The relevant cell can be found at position (1,5) because it corresponds to the column labeled \"points\" in the first row.\n\n#### Step 3: Extract the value from the relevant cell\nFrom the table, the value for Real Murcia at position (1,5) is \"47 + 9\". This means that the team has scored a total of 56 points.\n\n#### Step 4: Compare with other teams' point values\nWe need to check if any other team has scored more than 56 points. We can do this by comparing the \"points\" column of each row.\n\n#### Step 5: Identify rows with higher or equal points\nRows (2,5) and (3,5) have values greater than 56 (45+7 = 52 and 44+6 = 50 respectively), so they cannot be considered as having more points. Row (4,5) has a value of 42 + 4 = 46 which is less than Real Murcia's points.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclusion\nAfter comparing all teams' point values, we can conclude that the claim \"Real Murcia have the highest amount of point\" is FALSE because they do not have the most points among all teams.\n\n#### Step 7: Output final answer in JSON format\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be verified\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Locate the relevant cell in the table\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Extract the value from the relevant cell\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Compare with other teams' point values\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 5,\n            \"description\": \"Identify rows with higher or equal points\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 6,\n            \"description\": \"Conclusion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"points\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
