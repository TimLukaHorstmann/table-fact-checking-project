    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the claim's condition**: The claim states that Keiko Tamai loses two times after winning her first match.\n\n2. **Locate relevant information in the table**:\n   - First, we need to find out if Keiko Tamai has a record of having won her first match. This can be determined by finding the row with \"win\" in the \"res\" column and looking at the preceding rows for any matches where the opponent is not marked as being a future or current opponent.\n\n3. **Find subsequent losses after winning that first match**:\n   - After verifying she has won her first match, we will then locate all subsequent matches where Keiko Tamai loses.\n\n4. **Check loss frequency and count them**: We need to verify if these subsequent losses occur two times after the win of the first match.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The table shows that Keiko Tamai won her first match against Etsuko Kato with a submission (armbar) in 2:11 minutes, under \"res\" as \"win\".\n   \n2. Now we check if there are two subsequent losses after this win.\n\n3. Upon examining the table, Keiko Tamai loses to Kazue Terui, Yuiga Yuiga, and Mika Harigae.\n\n4. Since she lost three times following her first match, not just two, our reasoning is that the claim is false.\n\n5. Now we identify all relevant cells for reference:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Keiko Tamai wins the first match.\",\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"res\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Two subsequent losses, Kazue Terui and Yuiga Yuiga followed by Mika Harigae.\",\n      \"row_index\": [21,20],\n      \"column_name\": [\"opponent\", \"res\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The JSON output is formatted strictly as per the instructions provided.",

Specifically, we are looking for a record of \"10 - 6\".\n\n### Step 3: Locate relevant rows in the table that meet the condition\nWe will search for rows where the opponent is Keiko Tamia and the method is \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\n### Step 4: Inspect each row to see if it matches the claimed record of 10 - 6\nOnce we find a row meeting the first part, we need to check if Keiko Tamia's record in that match was indeed 10 - 6.\n\n### Step 5: Confirm or deny the claim based on the findings from step 4\nIf we confirm the record is 10 - 6 for one of the unanimous decisions matches involving Keiko Tamia, then the claim is true.

However, upon closer inspection of other rows that don't immediately disqualify them as relevant due to their own reasons, we see there's an oversight in the initial assessment: There actually isn't a match where Keiko Tamia had a unanimous decision against anyone with a record ending in \"10 - 6\".\n```\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 15,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 16,\n    \"column_name\": \"method\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, due to the oversight in step 5's explanation and upon reviewing again, it becomes clear there is no direct match that fulfills all conditions provided. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 4 involved an initial oversight leading to not directly identifying a row that meets both conditions of being against Keiko Tamia with a unanimous decision outcome AND having the record 10 - 6, indicating a more thorough check is needed for accurate conclusion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
