First, we need to find the score for September 28, 2003, from the table.\n   - Looking at the relevant row (week 4), we see that \"result\" is \"w 24 - 20\", which means the Houston Texans scored 24 points.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the score for November 16, 2003, from the table.\n   - Looking at the relevant row (week 11), we see that \"result\" is \"w 12 - 10\", which means the Houston Texans scored 12 points.\n\n3. Now that we have both scores, we can determine if the claim is true by comparing them.\n   - The score on September 28, 2003 was 24 points, and the score on November 16, 2003 was 12 points.\n   - Since 24 > 12, the Houston Texans scored more points on September 28, 2003 than on November 16, 2003.\n\n4. Lastly, we need to identify which cells contain relevant information for our comparison and provide it in JSON format.\n   - The relevant rows are:\n     ```json\n{\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}\n```\n\n     and\n     ```json\n{\n    \"row_index\": 11,\n    \"column_name\": \"result\"\n}\n```\n   \n5. After comparing the scores, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n   - Since the score on September 28, 2003 was higher than on November 16, 2003, the claim that \"the houston texans score more point on september 28 , 2003 than on november 16 , 2003\" is TRUE.\n\n#### Final JSON Output:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 11,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 11,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
