We find that game #63 is the only one with \"warriors\" spelled correctly as part of the team name in its original form, although some games have other city names as part of the team's full name.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the win-loss record from the table\nIn game #63, the Warriors' final score was w 95 - 85 (ot), indicating a win. Therefore, we can infer that their overall win-loss record is at least 31-42 as of game #73 and does not go beyond this.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the specific claim matches any part of our analysis\nThe claim states \"6 and 11\", which exactly matches our calculated records from March 8th to March 29th for Golden State Warriors games.
