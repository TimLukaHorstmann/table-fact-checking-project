We have identified 6 such companies so far.\n\n4. **Consider the Claim**: The claim states that there are 5 headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. Based on our previous step, we know that there are indeed more than 5 headquarters in Stockholm, but this is not relevant to the truth of the claim.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate Claim**: Since the table lists the same company (Ericsson) with a different rank (2), it's clear that the table contains multiple entries for the same location.

If the number of employees of Volvo is greater than 40000 plus the number of employees of Sandvik, then the claim is FALSE. Otherwise, it is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between the number of employees of Volvo and the threshold of 40000:\n98162 - 40000 = 58162\n\nSince this difference is not zero, we know that Volvo has more than 40000 employees.\nHowever, the claim states that Volvo has \"over\" 40000 employees. This implies that we need to check if Volvo has at least 40001 employees.\n\nSince Volvo has 98162 employees and Sandvik has 50030 employees, which is less than half of Volvo's employee count, the statement does indeed hold true as a comparison but with much lower threshold.\n\n\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

To verify this, we need to compare the number of employees at Sandvik with another company's employee count.\n\n### Step 2: Identify a comparison group for Sandvik\nSince the claim mentions \"over 40,000 more employee\" compared to Sandvik, we can look at companies with fewer or similar numbers of employees as potential comparisons. Given that the table ranks companies by size (employees), we'll compare Sandvik's number of employees (50030) against a larger company.\n\n### Step 3: Find a relevant comparison in the table\nWe need to find another company with more than 40,000 employees to directly compare with Sandvik's employee count. The only company that fits this criteria and has enough employees to make for a direct comparison is Ericsson (104525 employees), as it has significantly more employees.\n\n### Step 4: Verify if the claim holds true\nGiven that Sandvik has fewer than 40,000 employees, we can compare its number of employees with that of another company like Ericsson.
