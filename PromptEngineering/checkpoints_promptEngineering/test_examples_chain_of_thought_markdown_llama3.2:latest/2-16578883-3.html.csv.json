Row 1 does not have that rank, but we are looking at the rank with an index of one (thus it is actually the number 1).\n\n5. **Check the value in the relevant cell**:\n   - According to the table, the value for 2009 in row 1 (Lake Buena Vista, Florida, USA) was indeed $14721000.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the location of the number 1 rank amusement park matches what is stated by the claim and its value for 2009 does match as well, we should look further into if the location can be confirmed.\n\n7. **Locate an other row with same information**:\n    - Row 2 has a value in column \"2009\" which is $15900000.\n    - Since that is larger than what is stated by the claim ($14721000), this means there must be two rows (rank one and rank two) with values of $14721000. However, row three also matches.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both rank 1 and 2 and 3 have a value that matches what's claimed, we should determine the relevance to see if any further conclusions can be made regarding its accuracy.\n\n9. **Re-evaluate location of number one amusement park based on relevant cells**: \n    - The claim states \"the number 1 rank amusement park was located in Orlando\", Florida, USA.\n    - However, row 1 (index 1) has a value of $14721000, indicating that the first ranked amusement park is indeed located at Lake Buena Vista, not Orlando.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate answer**: \n     - Based on step 9, we can conclude that the claim is false because it misidentifies the location of the number 1 rank amusement park.\n\n11. **List relevant cells**: \n     ```\n [\n       {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\":\"location\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 2,\"column_name\":\"location\"}\n     ]\n    ```\n\n### Final Answer\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Verify the location of the number 1 rank amusement park\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if this location matches the claim's location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Verify the value of 2009 for the number 1 rank amusement park\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Consider if there is any other cell where this value could exist\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Check the value in the relevant cell\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 9,\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 10,\n      \"description\": \"Re-evaluate location of number one amusement park based on relevant cells\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 11,\n      \"description\": \"Re-evaluate answer\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2,\"column_name\":\"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
