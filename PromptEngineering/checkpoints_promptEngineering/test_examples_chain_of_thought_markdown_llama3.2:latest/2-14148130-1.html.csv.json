We are looking for a row where the points difference is exactly 0.\n\nStep 2: Check the value of drawn and lost games in that row.\nOnce we find the row with points difference 0, we need to check if both the \"drawn\" and \"lost\" values match the claim. According to the claim, when the points difference is 0, the number of drawn games should be 3 and the number of lost games should be 5.\n\nStep 3: Verify that no other rows with a points difference of 0 have different numbers of drawn and lost games.\nWe need to confirm that there are no other rows in the table where the points difference is 0, but either the \"drawn\" or \"lost\" values do not match the claim.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision about the truth value of the claim based on our findings.\nBased on steps 1-3, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false. If all conditions are met in one row and none other rows meet these conditions then claim is TRUE else FALSE.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Find the row with points difference of 0\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check drawn and lost values in that row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Verify that no other rows meet these conditions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Make a decision about the truth value of the claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The relevant cells are in row index 8 because the table has no other rows that have points difference equal to zero.",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Check if there are any draws more than 3: Looking at the table, we see that there is a row with \"drawn\" equal to 0, which is less than or equal to 3. However, for completeness, let's check all rows.\n   - For row 7 (games=7, drawn=0): This value of drawn is indeed less than 3, but this isn't the only one where it could be used as a counterexample.\n\n2. Check if there are any losses more than 7: Looking at the table, we see that in all cases where 'loss' was recorded it was less than or equal to 7.\n\n3. Now let's check for row where 'drawn' is greater than 3 and/or 'lost' is greater than 7:\n   - For row 1 (games=7, drawn=0): This value of drawn is not more than 3.\n   - For row 2 (games=7, lost=2): This value of loss is less than 7.\n   - For row 3 (games=7, lost=2): Same as above for the 'lost' column.\n   - For row 4 (games=7, lost=2): Same as above for the 'lost' column.\n   - For row 5 (games=7, lost=3): This value of loss is less than 7.\n   - For row 6 (games=7, lost=5): This value of loss is indeed more than 7.\n\n4. Since there is a case where the 'lost' column has a value greater than 7, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if there are any draws more than 3\",\n    \"There isn't\",\n    \"Check if there are any losses more than 7\",\n    \"There isn't, but we need to check for rows where 'drawn' is greater than 3 and/or 'lost' is greater than 7\",\n    \"There isn't for the first 5 cases, but row 6 has a loss of 5, which is more than 7\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"lost\"}\n  ]\n}",
