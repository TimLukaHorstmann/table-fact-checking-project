We will check if hawthorn won (score > away team score) and compare their scores in this specific match.\n3. Then, we'll verify that the date mentioned in the claim is indeed April 29th, 1939.\n\n### Relevant Data:\n| home team       | home team score   | away team       | away team score   | venue                 |   crowd | date          |\n|:----------------|:------------------|:----------------|:------------------|:----------------------|--------:|:--------------|\n| hawthorn        | 17.13 (115)       | north melbourne | 11.11 (77)        | glenferrie oval       |   11000 | 29 april 1939 |\n| fitzroy         | 14.18 (102)       | st kilda        | 20.14 (134)       | brunswick street oval |   15000 | 29 april 1939 |\n| essendon        | 19.21 (135)       | melbourne       | 21.15 (141)       | windy hill            |   20000 | 29 april 1939 |\n| richmond        | 20.19 (139)       | footscray       | 17.8 (110)        | punt road oval        |   26000 | 29 april 1939 |\n| south melbourne | 15.17 (107)       | collingwood     | 21.20 (146)       | lake oval             |   17000 | 29 april 1939 |\n| geelong         | 14.8 (92)         | carlton         | 11.13 (79)        | corio oval            |   15000 | 29 april 1939 |\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. Hawthorn's home team score is 115, and north melbourne's away team score is 77. Since hawthorn scored more than north melbourne, the claim that \"hawthorn destroyed north melbourne\" seems to be true.\n2.

Now, let's compare this value with other attendances in the table: \n    * Essendon vs Melbourne has an attendance of 20000\n    * Richmond vs Footscray has an attendance of 26000\n    * South Melbourne vs Collingwood has an attendance of 17000\n    * Geelong vs Carlton has an attendance of 15000\n4.

We need to verify if this information is correct by checking the attendance figures for all games.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see the attendance figure for each game:\n\t* Essendon vs. Melbourne (20000)\n\t* Fitzroy vs. St Kilda (15000)\n\t* South Melbourne vs. Collingwood (17000)\n\t* Geelong vs. Carlton (15000)\n4. We notice that there are two games with 15000 attendance: Fitzroy vs. St Kilda and Geelong vs. Carlton.\n5. Since the claim specifically mentions Essendon vs. North Melbourne, we need to verify if their game had the lowest attendance.\n6. According to the table, the attendance figure for Essendon vs. North Melbourne is indeed 11000.\n7. Comparing this with the other games, we can see that 11000 (Essendon vs. North Melbourne) is less than 15000 (Fitzroy vs. St Kilda and Geelong vs. Carlton).\n8. Therefore, the claim that the lowest attended game was between Essendon and North Melbourne, with 15000 in attendance, is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Claim states that the lowest attended game was between Essendon and North Melbourne, with 15000 in attendance.\",\n      \"result\": \"Essendon vs. North Melbourne has lower attendance than other games.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Verify if this information is correct by checking the attendance figures for all games.\",\n      \"result\": \"Attendance figures are provided in the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Looking at the table, we can see the attendance figure for each game.\",\n      \"result\": \"Attendance figures are 20000 (Essendon vs. Melbourne), 15000 (Fitzroy vs. St Kilda and Geelong vs. Carlton), 17000 (South Melbourne vs. Collingwood).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Notice that there are two games with 15000 attendance.\",\n      \"result\": \"Fitzroy vs. St Kilda and Geelong vs. Carlton both have 15000 attendance.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"5: Check if Essendon vs. North Melbourne has the lowest attendance.\",\n      \"result\": \"Attendance for Essendon vs. North Melbourne is 11000.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"6: Compare with other games.\",\n      \"result\": \"11000 (Essendon vs. North Melbourne) is less than 15000 (Fitzroy vs. St Kilda and Geelong vs. Carlton).\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
