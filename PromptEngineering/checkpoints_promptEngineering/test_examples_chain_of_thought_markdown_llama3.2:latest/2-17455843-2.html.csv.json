Check if the score in the 8th row is indeed the highest among all teams.\n5. Verify that there are no other rows with a higher score.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the table, Lincoln City's score of 8-3 in the match against Barrow on November 29, 1930, appears to be one of the highest scores in the FA Cup during that season. However, without reviewing every single row and comparison, we cannot confirm if this is the absolute highest scoring game.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's look at other high-scoring games:\n- Gillingham scored 7-2 against Guildford City.\n- Fulham scored 1-6 against Ilford in a replay.\n- Southend United did not have a high score that could rival Lincoln City's 8-3.\n\nWithout explicit evidence of higher scores, we can conclude that the claim \"Lincoln City have the highest scoring game within the 1930 - 31 FA Cup\" is likely to be TRUE.",

For replay match #15: `wombwell` vs `wellington town`, `wombwell` won (score not relevant).\n    \n    b. For replay match #18: `lancaster town` vs `accrington stanley`, `lancaster town` won.\n    \n    c. For replay match #20: `coventry city` vs `northampton town`, `coventry city` lost.\n    \n    d. For replay match #22: `exeter city` vs `northfleet united`, `exeter city` won.\n    \n    e. For replay match #23: `new brighton` vs `carlisle united`, `new brighton` won.\n    \n    f. For replay match #25: `taunton town (1)` vs `crystal palace`, `taunton town (1)` lost.\n    \n    g. For replay match #26: `torquay united` vs `southend united`, `torquay united` lost.\n    \n    h.

For replay match #33: `rotherham united` vs `newark town`, `rotherham united` lost.\n    \n    o. For replay match #34: `peterborough & fletton united` vs `aldershot`, `peterborough & fletton united` won.\n\n3. **Count the total number of times the away team lost**: From the analysis above, we can see that the away team lost in 4 out of the 6 replay matches.\n4. **Determine if the claim is true or false**: The claim states \"of the 6 replay match , 3 of the 6 game be lose by the away team\". Since we found that the away team lost in exactly half (4/6) of the 6 replay matches, the claim seems to hold true.\n5. **Identify relevant cells for analysis**: The table has many rows and columns; however, our steps were only necessary for cells containing information relevant to our reasoning process.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"total number of replay matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"number of times the away team lost in each match\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"total number of times the away team lost in all matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"determine if claim is true or false based on count of losses\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 34,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
