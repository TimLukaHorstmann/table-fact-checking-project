    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the least attended game\nFirst, we need to identify which games had the lowest attendance during the 1953 season. The claim suggests that this would be on September 27, 1953, against the Chicago Cardinals.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the relevant game in the table\nThe game played by the Washington Redskins (Chicago Cardinals were actually a different team name for a team based in what is now Washington D.C.) on September 27, 1953 needs to be found. We should check if this was indeed their lowest attendance of the season.\n\n### Step 3: Find the attendance for the specified game\nLooking at the table, we see that there is no direct information about the Washington Redskins; however, it's stated that the \"chicago cardinals\" played them on September 27, 1953. To find the correct data we should look at the team name more closely and refer to any team playing in what is now D.C. as the washington redskins. Since there is no information directly about the Washington Redskins in this table and their attendance would be lower than other teams that played them during that time frame.\n\n### Step 4: Verify if it's the lowest attendance for Washington Redskins\nGiven the absence of data directly related to Washington Redskins, we should verify that they were indeed playing on September 27 against Chicago Cardinals. According to historical records in NFL, Chicago Cardinals became Washington Redskins in 1937. But since this event did not happen until the following year so we can safely assume they are the same team for our purpose.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nWe see from the table that the attendance at Chicago Cardinals vs Washington Redskins on September 27, 1953 is indeed lower than any other game played by Washington Redskins during that season since their data cannot be verified. Therefore, this claim seems true based on given information.\n\n\n\n### Chain of Thought\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the least attended game\",\n    \"Step 2: Locate the relevant game in the table\",\n    \"Step 3: Find the attendance for the specified game\",\n    \"Step 4: Verify if it's the lowest attendance for Washington Redskins\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Since none of these teams have \"Washington\" as part of their name, we must assume that the correct team should be either Chicago Cardinals or Chicago Bears (as both are mentioned in the table) for the purpose of evaluating the claim.\n\n2. **Determine which games have scores within 3 points**: We will consider the first option and look at the Chicago Bears' games as they are the ones that would be closest to being associated with Washington. \n\n   - November 15 , 1953: Loss by 3 points (27-24)\n   - December 13 , 1953: Loss by more than 1 point (14-13) is not within the 3-point limit.\n\n3. **Evaluate if both losses are by 3 point or less**: The Bears lost exactly one game by 3 points, so there's at least two games that do not meet this criteria.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate claim with another team to consider**: Since only the Chicago Bears have scores within 3 points of a loss, we should confirm if this is indeed close enough and see how many of those losses are by exactly 3 points or less.\n\n   - November 15 , 1953: Loss by 3 points (27-24)\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there's only one game where the Bears lost by more than 3 points, the claim that \"the Washington Redskins lose 2 game by 3 point or less during their 1953 season\" is actually incorrect because it was Chicago Bears who had a loss by exactly 3 points.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the team mentioned in the claim.

First, we need to understand the claim: \"the washington redskins play the pittsburgh steelers 1 more time than they play the baltimore colt during their 1953 season\". This means that for each opponent, if Washington Redskins played them more times than Baltimore Colts, the claim is true.\n\n2. Check how many times Washington Redskins play Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts:\n   - From table 12, we see that Washington Redskins played Pittsburgh Steelers twice.\n   - From table 5 and 6, we see that Washington Redskins played Baltimore Colts three times.\n\n3. The problem statement does not give information about Washington Redskins playing the Baltimore colts or any other team called \"Washington Redskins\". Therefore we have to consider if they play the pittsburgh steelers more times than baltimore colts considering only data from 1953 season\n\n4. Since data shows that Washington Redskins played Pittsburgh Steelers twice and played baltimore Colts three times, and this is a single season, it is impossible for them to play Pittsburgh Steelrs one time more than Baltimore colts.\n\n5.
