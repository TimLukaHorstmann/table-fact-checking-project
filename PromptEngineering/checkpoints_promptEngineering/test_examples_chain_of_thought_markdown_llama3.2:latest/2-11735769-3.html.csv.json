    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Analyze the claim: The claim states that Jerry Traino was nominated for the 2008 Australian Kids' Choice Award in two different categories.\n2. Check if there are any records of Jerry Traino being involved in the table:\n   - In 2013, Tuff Puppy is nominated for \"Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program\" (Year: 2013, Work: Tuff Puppy).\n   - There is no information about Jerry Traino in this row. Therefore, I will check another year.\n   - In 2011, Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil has a nominated actor named Jerry Traino for \"Funniest Character\" (Year: 2011, Work: Icarly).\n   - There is no information about Jerry Traino being involved in any other years.\n\n3. Analyze if the claim is true based on the available data:\n   - In the year 2011, Jerry Traino was nominated for \"Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil\" in one category.\n   - The claim states that he was nominated in two categories in 2008 (which does not exist) and at least one other category in another year.\n\n4. Determine if there are any records of Jerry Traino being involved in the table:\n   - In 2010, \"2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards\" has a won actor named Jerry Traino for \"Lol award (shared with ensemble)\" (Year: 2010, Work: Icarly).\n   - There is no information about Jerry Traino being nominated or involved in any other category.\n\n5. Determine if the claim can be verified:\n   - Based on the available data, there are records of Jerry Traino's involvement in 2009 and 2011.\n   - The claim cannot be verified because it mentions a non-existent year (2008).\n\n6. Provide an answer based on the analysis:\n   - The claim is FALSE.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"won\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"won\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
