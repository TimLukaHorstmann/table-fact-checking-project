    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n1. To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to find the points for place 1 and place 15.\n2. The point for place 1 can be found by looking at the cell with row index 1 and column name \"points\". This gives us a value of 5.\n3. Similarly, the point for place 15 can be found by looking at the cell with row index 15 and column name \"points\". This gives us a value of 0.\n4. Now that we have the points for both places, we need to calculate how many points over 45 is higher than those who are in place 15. Since there's no way to be higher by 0 (the number), we will assume it means the answer has to be greater than any positive value that results from adding \"over 45\" to that value.\n5. The statement claims that point for place 1 is over 45 higher than those who are in place 15. Let's calculate how much more point for place 1 (5) is compared to the point for place 15 (0). Since we're assuming it means greater than a certain amount, let's use this value and determine if it meets the claim.\n6. 45 + 0 = 45\n7. 5 - 45 = -40\n8. Because the statement claims \"over\" 45 higher, since that is negative, the point for place 1 is not over 45 higher than those who are in place 15.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Step 1: Determine which cells to find\",},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 2: Find the value of points for place 1 by looking at cell (1, \\\"points\\\")\", },\n    {\"step\": \"Step 3: Find the value of points for place 15 by looking at cell (15, \\\"points\\\")\", },\n    {\"step\": \"Step 4: Calculate how many more than 45 is higher than those who are in place 15\",},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 5: Compare the calculated amount to 45 and determine if the claim is met\",},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 6: The point for place 1 (5) is not over 45 higher than those who are in place 15\",}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
