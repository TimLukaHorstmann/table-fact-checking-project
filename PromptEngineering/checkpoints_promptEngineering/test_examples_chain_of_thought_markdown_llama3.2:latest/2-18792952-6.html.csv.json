This means we are checking if Dan Povenmire is listed as the director in both rows of the table.\n\n2. Let's examine each row individually:\n   - For the first row (\"the whizzard of ow\"), the director is Bret Haaland, not Dan Povenmire.\n   - For the second row (\"museum scream\"), we see that Dan Povenmire is listed as the director.\n   - For the third row (\"hare and loathing in las vegas\"), Peter Shin and Bill Kopp are listed as directors (in a list), but this does not match our claim since Dan Povenmire is not one of them.\n\n3. We need to confirm if Dan Povenmire was the director for \"my generation g - g - gap\". According to the table, Dan Povenmire is indeed listed as the director for \"my generation g - g - gap\".\n\n4. Now we can conclude that only part of our claim (\"Dan Povenmire be the director for my generation g - g - gap\") is true.\n\n5.
