For the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League season, the table states that the first leg result for FC Flora Tallinn is 1 - 0, which does not match the claim's assertion of a 1 - 0 result in favor of Juventus FC (there is no such information in the table).\n4. However, there are multiple instances where FC Flora Tallinn is stated to have played against teams with first leg results of 1 - 0, but all of these instances belong to different seasons.\n5. The claim specifically mentions \"while in the 2011 - 12 season fc flora tallinn have a 1st leg of 1 - 0\", which does not directly match Juventus FC's result but seems to suggest a comparison between the two teams' performances.\n6. To verify if the statement is true or false, we should compare FC Flora Tallinn's first-leg performance in the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League season with Juventus FC's first-leg performance in the same season and verify that FC Flora Tallinn have indeed lost to Juventus.\n\nHowever, the most crucial step of verification would involve checking which team won between FC Flora Tallinn and Juventus FC for this specific match in the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League.

We need to check if there are any instances in the table where the 1st leg is 0 - 1 for Celtic and Ac Omonia separately.\n3. For Celtic: In the table, we find that in the season 1987-88, Celtic played against ac omonia in the first round of the European Cup. The 1st leg was indeed 0-1 for Celtic.\n4. However, there is no instance where Ac Omonia's 1st leg score was also 0 - 1 for that specific season or any other relevant row as per the conditions stated by claim. For the sake of thoroughness in our reasoning let\u2019s see if it was only the first round.\n\n5. Let us further check for both clubs. In table we can find Ac Omonia had 1-1 draw with Celtic in 1966-67 season, which does meet the criteria stated by claim.\n6. In conclusion from our steps above: Celtic meets the condition, but Ac Omonia\u2019s first round score is 0 - 1 only for that particular instance where Celtic also scored 0 - 1.
