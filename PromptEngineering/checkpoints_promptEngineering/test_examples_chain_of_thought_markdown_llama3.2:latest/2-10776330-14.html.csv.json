    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that Geelong be the home team several times.\n2. To verify this, we need to check if Geelong appears as the home team on multiple rows in the table.\n3. We can start by looking at each row and checking the \"home team\" column.\n4. For example, let's look at the first row: Geelong is listed as the home team with a score of 11.7 (73).\n5. Now, let's move to the next row: Fitzroy is listed as the home team with a score of 12.15 (87). Geelong is not in this row.\n6. We continue checking each row until we find more instances of Geelong being the home team.\n\nAfter examining all rows:\n\n- In the first row, Geelong is indeed the home team.\n- In the fifth row, Melbourne is listed as the home team, but Geelong is not.\n- However, in the third row, South Melbourne is listed as the home team and has Geelong on the same date and 29 july 1961 (same row index).\n- Since there are multiple rows where Geelong is the home team (specifically in the first, second, and third row), we can conclude that the claim \"Geelong be the home team several time\" is true.\n\nHere's a final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}]\n}",
