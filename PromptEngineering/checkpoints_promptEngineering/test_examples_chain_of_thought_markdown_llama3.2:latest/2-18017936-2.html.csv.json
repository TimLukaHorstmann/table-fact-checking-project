Next, we need to find the goal difference for each of these clubs in the table:\n\t* For jfk olimps r\u043a\u0430ga, the goal difference is +96 (calculated as goals for - goals against).\n\t* For skonto - 2, the goal difference is +55 (calculated as goals for - goals against).\n3. Now, let's determine if the claim is TRUE by comparing the two goal differences:\n\t* We need to check if the goal difference of jfk olimps r\u043a\u0430ga is twice as much as skonto - 2.\n4. To do this, we'll divide the goal difference of jfk olimps rkaga by the goal difference of skonto - 2 and see if it's equal to 2:\n\t* (+96) / (+55) = 1.76 (not equal to 2)\n5. Since the result is not exactly 2, we need to check if the claim can be TRUE in any other way:\n\t* We'll also check if the goal difference of jfk olimps rkaga is less than twice the goal difference of skonto - 2:\n\t* (+96) < 2 * (+55)\n\t* (+96) < +110\n\t* This inequality is FALSE, so the claim cannot be TRUE.\n6. Since we've checked all possible scenarios and found that the claim is not true, our final answer is:\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"=\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to extract the data from the relevant cells of the table.\n   We can do this by identifying which clubs have a goal difference above 50.\n   From the given table, we see that:\n   - For club jfk olimps r\u043a\u0430ga, the goal difference is +96.\n   - For club fc ditton, the goal difference is +64.\n\n2. Now, let's check if these two clubs are the only ones with a goal difference above 50.\n   We can do this by looking at all other clubs in the table:\n   - For club ventspils - 2, the goal difference is +83, which is higher than fc ditton's and jfk olimps r\u043a\u0430ga's.\n   - The rest of the clubs have a lower goal difference.\n\n3. Since there are two clubs with a goal difference above 50 (jfk olimps r\u043a\u0430ga and fc ditton), but we also found another club that has an even higher goal difference (+83), this means the claim is FALSE.\n\n4.
