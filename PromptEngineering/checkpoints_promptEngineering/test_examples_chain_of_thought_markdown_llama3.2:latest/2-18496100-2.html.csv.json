Hence it is not true that result be counted 5 time in Bhind\n\n5. **Counting in Datia District**:\n   - The claim states to count the result 3 times in Datia.\n   - There are only two constituencies (20 and 21) which have total number of electorates as 130161+139600 = 269761. Hence it is not true that result be counted 3 time in Datia\n\n6. **Check if claim is True or False**:\n   - From step 4 and step 5, we can conclude that the statement \"the result be count in bhind district 5 time and 3 time in datia\" is false.\n\n7. **List Relevant Cells for Conclusion**:\n   ```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the Claim\",\n    \"Find Relevant Data for Bhind District\",\n    \"Counting in Bhind District\",\n    \"Find Relevant Data for Datia District\",\n    \"Counting in Datia District\",\n    \"Check if claim is True or False\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"reserved for\"}\n  ]\n}",

This indicates that counting the result three times in Bhind does not exactly equal its total value, implying a possible misunderstanding or misinterpretation of \"count\" as opposed to \"add up\".\n   - According to the claim, we need to count the result \"5 times\" in Datia district.\n   - The number of electorates for constituency 20 (130161) can be divided by 5: 130161 / 5 = 26032.2, which does not exactly match the requirement because you cannot count a fraction of an electorate.\n   - Similarly, for constituency 21 in Datia, 139600 / 5 = 27920, again not meeting the \"5 times\" criteria perfectly.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the given information and understanding that the claim requires exact multiplications (and not just divisions), we can conclude that the conditions of counting results exactly three times in Bhind and five times in Datia are not fully met due to fractional outcomes from division, suggesting a potential misunderstanding or misinterpretation.\n\n### Final JSON Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"Bhind\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"Datia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"number of electorates (2009)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"number of electorates (2009)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"number of electorates (2009)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
