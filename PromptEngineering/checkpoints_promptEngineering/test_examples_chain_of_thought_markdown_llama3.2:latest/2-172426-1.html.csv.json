    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the date when Princess Mary was born.\n2. Since her birthdate is not explicitly mentioned in the table, we will look for her \"dates\" column, which lists the range of years she was alive (\"1631 - 1660\").\n3. The start year (1631) is likely her birth year, so we can assume that Princess Mary was born around 1631.\n4. Now, let's check if Princess Mary married William II before she turned 12. To do this, we need to find the date of their marriage and her age at that time.\n5. According to the \"date married\" column for Princess Mary (order 1), she was married to William II in 1641.\n6. If we subtract 1641 from 1631, we get -10, which means Princess Mary would have been about 11 years old when she got married to William II.\n7. Since we are checking if she was married before turning 12 and there is no indication that her marriage occurred after she turned 12, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Find Princess Mary's birthdate\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Determine start year from dates column\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Assume birth year is 1631\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Find date of marriage for Princess Mary (order 1)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate age at time of marriage\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Check if she was married before turning 12\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"name dates\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date married\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"dates\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Determine the relevance of the claim**: The claim is about Princess Louise not getting married until she was around 38 years old.\n\n2. **Find the relevant row(s) in the table**: To verify this claim, we need to check the \"date married\" column and find a row where the date matches or exceeds 38 years after 1867 (the birth year of Princess Louise).\n\n3. **Analyze the birth year of Princess Louise**: According to the table, Princess Louise was born in 1867.\n\n4. **Calculate the age at marriage for each relevant row**:\n    - For row 5: The date married is 1889, and her birth year is 1867. She would be approximately 22 years old.\n    - For row 6: There is no information about Princess Louise being married in this row.\n\n5. **Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE**: Based on our analysis, we can conclude that Princess Louise did not get married until she was around 38 years old. The earliest marriage date for her (1889) indicates an age of approximately 22, making it impossible to fulfill the condition of being 38 when married.\n\n6. **Identify the relevant cells**: We need to look at row 5 and 6 for the accurate information of Princess Louise's marital status around the time she reached 38 years old. For this, we should take \"row_index\" = 5 and column name as \"date married\".\n\n7. **Output the answer in JSON format**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim is about Princess Louise not getting married until she was around 38 years old.\",\n    \"Find the relevant row(s) in the table: row 5 and 6 for her marriage date\",\n    \"Analyze the birth year of Princess Louise: born in 1867\",\n    \"Calculate the age at marriage for each relevant row: row 5 is too early (22 years old)\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE: based on our analysis, it's FALSE because she got married before turning 38.\",\n    \"Identify the relevant cells: [\\\"row_index\\\": 5, \\\"column_name\\\": \\\"date married\\\"]\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim is about Princess Louise not getting married until she was around 38 years old.\",\n    \"Find the relevant row(s) in the table: row 5 and 6 for her marriage date\",\n    \"Analyze the birth year of Princess Louise: born in 1867\",\n    \"Calculate the age at marriage for each relevant row: row 5 is too early (22 years old)\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE: based on our analysis, it's FALSE because she got married before turning 38.\",\n    \"Identify the relevant cells: [\\\"row_index\\\": 5, \\\"column_name\\\": \\\"date married\\\"]\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}]\n}",

Identify all princesses on the list: We need to look at the \"order\", \"name\" columns to identify which rows represent princesses.\n2. Filter out non-divorced princesses: Since we're interested in divorce, we should only consider rows where the husband has an end date that is later than the princess's start date or a range with no end date (which would indicate they are still married).\n3. Identify Anne: From step 1 and step 2, identify which row represents Princess Anne.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- Step 1:\n    - For order 7, we have two rows for \"Anne\". We need to check each row.\n    - For order 6, the princess is Mary. She was married from 1922 until her death in 1965. Since there's no end date listed for Anne in this row, we conclude she is still married.\n    - For order 5, the princess is Louise. She was married to Duke of Fife from 1889 until his death in 1912. Since there's an end date, we can assume they are divorced or separated because he died first.\n    - For order 4, the princess is Victoria. Her start and end dates show that she was married for most her life but with her husband dying before her (according to the given information), it is safe to say they are divorced.\n    - For order 3, the princess is Charlotte. She died in 1828 without an end date listed for her marriage, which suggests she might still be alive or at least married until her death. Thus, we cannot conclude divorce here based on data provided.\n    - For order 2, the princess is Anne. Since there's no end date listed for this row, it can't be concluded that they are divorced because he could still be living.\n    - For order 1, the princess is Mary. Her husband died before her (between 1641 and 1660), which means she was a widow rather than a divorced person.\n\n- Step 2: The relevant cells for this step would include information on whether each princess has an end date later than their start date or if they are listed with no end date.\n\n- Step 3:\n    - For Princess Anne (order 7), we see that the \"princess royal from\" range ends in \"present\", meaning she is still married.

To check this, we need to find her date of birth.\n\n3. **Find Prince Mary's date of birth**: Since Prince Mary's dates are given as \"1631 - 1660\", it can be inferred that she was born in 1631 because that is the earlier end of the range. Now we have enough information to assess the claim about Prince Mary dying before age 40.\n\n4. **Evaluate if Prince Mary died before age 40**: Given her birth year as 1631, Prince Mary would have died in 1660.

We will look for divorces.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Princess Anne in the Table\nWe find Princess Anne at row 7 with two entries: \"anne , princess royal 1950 -           | 1987 - present\" and \"anne , princess royal 1950 -           | 1987 - present\".\n\n### Step 3: Check if Any Other Princesses Are Divorced \nLet's look for other princesses who might be divorced by examining each row in the table.\n\n- Row 1: Mary has a single husband, so no divorce.\n- Row 2: Anne is listed twice but the first instance does not have \"divorced\" mentioned and the second instance clearly shows that she was married to her husband until 1992 which indicates a divorce because they separated before 1987. So, we can count on this for a total of two instances where an \"anne\" princess is divorced.\n- Row 3: Charlotte has a single husband, so no divorce.\n- Row 4: Victoria is listed but does not mention divorce, however she does have a first name indicating her title before becoming queen. This instance will also indicate that a princess named \"victoria\" and married to \"frederick iii\", German Emperor, had a marriage status change as indicated by the \"1831 - 1888\" timeframe which signifies a death of her husband.\n- Row 5: Louise has a single husband, so no divorce. The row does not specify a divorce as there is an indication that she died before being divorced (the year 1931) in the table's formatting.\n- Row 6: Mary does not show any change in marriage status and thus could not be divorced by the data provided; however since her information includes a death of her husband it would have been indicated if he were alive past 1965 or at least dead before she was, but this isn't a divorce but rather a death. The indication that \"henry lascelles , 6th earl of harewood\" died in the table indicates his death occurred prior to being divorced; so there is no indication in row 6 for her being divorced.\n- Row 7: Anne at row 7 has two entries. Once she was married from \"1987 - present\", it's clear she was still with him, but as soon as the second entry appears (\"1992\"), this signifies that a divorce had occurred.\n\n### Step 4: Count Divorced Princesses\nWe have found one princess (row 2) whose first name is not specified for both entries, which would be \"anne\" in the table and two other instances of \"anne\". We can count on these for a total of three instances where an \"anne\" princess is divorced.\n\n### Step 5: Determine Claim Validity\nBased on our findings from step 4, we have found that there are indeed at least one (not exactly stated but we can consider it given the information of \"anne\") and then two more, making a total of three instances where an \"anne\" princess was divorced. The only claim is that \"princess anne of elizabeth be 1 of 3 princess on the list who have a divorce\". Given this and that there are indeed 3 rows with Anne being a title for these individuals, we can confidently say that our initial count matches the requirement.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nBased on our step-by-step reasoning above, the answer is:\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"dates\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \n      \"row_index\": 7, \n      \"column_name\": \"husband dates\" \n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2, \n      \"column_name\": \"dates\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"name dates\" \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant cell for the condition**: The claim mentions Princess Mary dying before turning 25, so we need to find her birth date to determine if she died at a young age.\n2. **Extract Princess Mary's birth date from the table**: Looking at the table, we see that there are two rows with \"mary , princess royal\" in the name column. The first row is for Princess Mary (1631 - 1660), so her dates are between 1631 and 1660.\n3. **Determine if Princess Mary died before turning 25**: Given her birth date range of 1631 - 1660, we can assume she was born around 1650-1655. If she died between 1642 and 1660 (her \"princess royal from\" dates), it's possible she died at a young age.\n4. **Check if any other princess royal has a more accurate birth date**: We need to ensure we're not missing another row with a more precise birth date for Princess Mary. Looking through the table again, there is no other row that seems relevant.\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the table and our assumptions about Princess Mary's birth date range, it's likely she died before turning 25.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the relevant cell for the condition\",\n      \"text\": \"The claim mentions Princess Mary dying before turning 25, so we need to find her birth date to determine if she died at a young age.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract Princess Mary's birth date from the table\",\n      \"text\": \"Looking at the table, we see that there are two rows with \\u201cmary , princess royal\\u201d in the name column.
