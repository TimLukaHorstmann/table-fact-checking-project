This means we need to check if Sa\u0161a Starovi\u0107 is indeed NOT part of the M Roma Volley team.\n\n2. Check the table for relevant information:\n   - We are looking for rows related to Sa\u0161a Starovi\u0107 and \"m roma volley\".\n   - In the table, there are multiple entries for Sa\u0161a Starovi\u0107, all belonging to different teams.\n   - However, one of these entries belongs to M Roma Volley.\n\n3. Determine if the claim is true or false:\n   - The claim says \"be not\", which suggests we need to verify that Sa\u0161a Starovi\u0107 is NOT part of the M Roma Volley team in 2008.\n   - Given that there are other rows for Sa\u0161a Starovi\u0107 with different teams, it seems like his affiliation with M Roma Volley cannot be universally denied based on this table alone. However, one specific entry does show him as a member of M Roma Volley.\n\n4. Final analysis:\n   - The claim's \"be not\" phrasing indicates that the truth could depend on whether Sa\u0161a Starovi\u0107 was indeed NOT part of M Roma Volley in 2008.\n   - Since there is at least one row confirming his membership, we should focus on identifying any potential inconsistencies or false negatives within this specific data point.\n\nHere's a JSON output with our reasoning:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Check the claim statement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Look for relevant entries in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim is true or false based on table data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Final analysis: check for inconsistencies\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Looking at the table, there is no clear indication of which players are on a \"female\" team roster. Therefore, I will assume that the claim is referring to players from the club \"Budu\u0107nost Podgorica\", regardless of their gender.\n3. Next, we need to count how many players from Budu\u0107nost Podgorica there are in total.\n4. There are 2 players with the name \"Sas\" and 1 player with the name \"Vlado\". I will assume that both of these names refer to male players (this information might not be explicitly stated in the table).\n5. However, upon re-examining the data, we find that only one other name mentioned in the table is \"Budu\u0107nost Podgorica\": sa\u0161a starovi\u0107.

To verify this claim, I need to determine if there are indeed 2 players on the roster from Budu\u0107nost Podgorica.\n7. After careful examination of the table, we find additional information: a cell titled \"2008 club\" containing the name \"famigliulo corigliano\", which is associated with another player named marko podra\u0161\u010danin (m). Since the \"2008 club\" column does not mention any female players from Budu\u0107nost Podgorica, I can conclude that there are only two male players.\n8.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that only 1 of the 12 players was not in the club VB 2008 tour.\n2. To verify this, we need to check if there are any players who were not part of the VB 2008 tour.\n\n#### Checking the Table:\n- The columns relevant to this task are '2008 club' and 'spike'.\n- We're looking for rows where '2008 club' is different from 'tours vb'.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are 12 players.\n4. Checking each player's '2008 club', we find the following:\n   - nikola kova\u010devi\u0107: rpa perugia\n   - dejan bojovi\u0107: gabeca montichiari\n   - novica bjelica: copra nordmeccanica\n   - bojan jani\u0107: marmi lanza verona\n   - vlado petkovi\u0107: budu\u0107nost podgorica\n   - marko samard\u017ei\u0107: tours vb\n   - nikola grbi\u0107: trentino volley\n   - milo\u0161 niki\u0107: sparkling milano\n   - andrija geri\u0107: lube banca marche\n   - ivan miljkovi\u0107: m roma volley\n   - sa\u0161a starovi\u0107: budu\u0107nost podgorica\n   - marko podra\u0161\u010danin: famigliulo corigliano\n\n5.
