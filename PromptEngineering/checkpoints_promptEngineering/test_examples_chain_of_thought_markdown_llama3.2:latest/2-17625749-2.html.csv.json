This requires checking every row in the table, excluding Barry RFC's row, to see if their 'drawn' cell value is greater than 1.\n\n4. **Verify no other team meets the condition**: Go down each column and check if the 'drawn' values for any other team are equal to or greater than 2 (since more than one game drawn).
