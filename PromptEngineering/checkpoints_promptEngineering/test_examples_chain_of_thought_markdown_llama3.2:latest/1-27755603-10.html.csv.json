However, there are also other indices where they lose (71,72 and 73), showing a total of 5 losses.\n\n### Step 7: Compare the number of losses to the claim.\nThe claim states that the Detroit Pistons lost 6 games during this period.

To verify this, we need to find the games where Rodney Stuckey led the team in points and confirm that it happened only once.\n3. Let's start by finding the rows where Rodney Stuckey leads in points. We can do this by filtering the table on the \"high points\" column and selecting only the rows where the value is not empty (to exclude cases where no one scored a lot of points).\n\n```markdown\n- Filter the table on the \"high points\" column.\n  * Select only rows where the value is not empty.\n```\n\n4.

To verify this, we need to check the \"record\" column in the table, which shows the team's win-loss record for each game.\n3. We can start by looking at the total number of games played and lost by the Pistons during this period. According to the table, the Pistons have played a total of 72 games (rows 62-73).\n4. By counting the number of rows with \"l\" in the score column (i.e., losses), we can determine how many games the Pistons lost. There are 9 rows with \"l\", indicating that the Pistons lost at least 9 games during this period.\n5. Since the claim states that the Pistons lose over 8 games, we need to check if the number of losses is indeed greater than 8.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"number of losses\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"number of losses\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that the Detroit Piston's lowest game attendance during this period occurred on March 20 against Atlanta at Phillips Arena.\n2.

If the attendance at March 20 was indeed lower than any other game during this period, then the claim would be TRUE.\n4. To confirm this, we need to find the highest attendance among all games in the table.\n\nHere are the relevant steps and reasoning:\n\n- For Step 2: The relevant cell is at row index 70 with column name \"location attendance\", which contains a value of 17580.\n- For Step 3:\n  - The relevant cells with the highest attendance values are at rows 68, 69, and 73. Their \"location attendance\" values are 15166, 22076, and 19216, respectively.\n\n5.
