    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about Cho Jae-jin's goals in the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. The first step is to identify the column that contains the score of each player, which is \"score\". However, it seems that the scores are written in a way that the goal scored by Cho Jae-jin is not explicitly mentioned.\n2. To clarify this point, we need to look at the result column (\"result\"). If the result is 5-0 or 7-0, for example, then the score of both teams would be different from what is stated in the \"score\" column.\n3. So, our next step is to look at the relevant rows that could contain Cho Jae-jin's goals. We know he scored a total of x goals based on our claim, so let us check this by comparing all values of \"score\" column with goal value in \"claim\". The score for each player is as follows:\n* 1 goal - Incheon (25 September 2003)\n* 1 goal - Muscat (24 October 2003)\n* 1 goal - Busan (19 December 2004)\n* 1 goal - Hong Kong (1 February 2006)\n* 1 goal - Seoul (11 October 2006)\n* 2 goals - Suwon (6 September 2006)\n* 2 goals - Seoul (5 July 2007)\n\n4. Now let us list the total number of each score:\n- The player with a total of \"1 goal\" has 4 scores.\n- The player with a total of \"2 goals\" has 2 scores.\n\n5. Since we are told in our claim that Cho Jae-jin scored a total of \"10 goals\", which is higher than the sum of all values from steps 3 and 4, it seems like our claim cannot be true based on data shown.\n\n6.

We need to find out how many goals Cho Jae-jin scored in each match and add them up to check if he scored a total of 15 goals.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that there are multiple rows with \"Cho Jae-jin\" as part of the venue name or description, but only one row has his name explicitly mentioned: `19 december 2004  | busan     | 1 goal  | 3 - 1    | friendly match                   | Cho Jae-jin`.\n4. In this row, Cho Jae-jin scored 1 goal.\n5. Since we can't find any other rows with Cho Jae-jin's name and a different number of goals, we will only consider the 1 goal he scored in the mentioned row.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n6. The total number of goals Cho Jae-jin scored is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We can only find one row with Cho Jae-jin's name and a certain number of goals, which is 1 goal. We cannot find any other rows to add up to a total of 15 goals.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to determine which matches are part of the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification.\n   - The relevant cells for this are:\n     ```\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Now, let's verify the score of Cho Jae-jin in these matches.\n   - From the table, we can see that in the first match (date: 25 september 2003), Cho Jae-jin scored 1 goal against Incheon. So far, this is true.\n   - However, since the claim says \"total of 3 goals\", let's move on to the next matches.\n   - In the second match (date: 24 october 2003), Cho Jae-jin also scored 1 goal against Muscat. This adds up to a total of 2 goals so far.\n   - Unfortunately, there is no information about Cho Jae-jin scoring any more goals after these two matches.\n\n3. Finally, let's verify if the claim is true based on our findings:\n   - Since we found that Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 2 goals in the first two matches, and this is less than 3 goals, the claim cannot be true.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
