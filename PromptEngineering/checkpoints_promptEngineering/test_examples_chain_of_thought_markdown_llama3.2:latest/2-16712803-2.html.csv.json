The next step is to verify if this value holds true among all relevant data.\n\nAfter verifying that there are no other rows with lower attendance values for different opponents, we can confidently conclude our final answer.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: St. Louis Cardinals as the opponent at a game with the lowest attendance\",\n    \"Locate the relevant data: Rows 14 and 15 in the table.\",\n    \"Compare with other teams: Check if row 14 has the lowest attendance among all opponents.\",\n    \"Verify if the claim holds true: If only one row has St. Louis Cardinals as an opponent with a lower attendance than any other, then the claim is valid.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, we need to identify the cell in the table that contains the highest attendance.\n   - The relevant cell for this step would be: { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n\n2. Next, we compare the attendance of all games in week 2 with the attendance of all other weeks.\n   - We need to look at cells with row index 2 and column name \"attendance\", as well as cells from other rows where the corresponding column name matches \"week\".\n\n3. After comparing, if we find that week 2 has a game with a higher attendance than any game in any other week, then the claim is true.\n   - For this step, relevant cells would be: { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } and possibly some from weeks 1-15.\n\n4. Since we are tasked to verify if the highest attendance was in week 2 against the denver broncos specifically, we have to make sure that this is indeed a game within week 2.\n   - Relevant cells would be: { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }.\n\n### Chain of Thought:\n\n- First, identify the cell with the highest attendance in week 2.\n- Compare it with all other games' attendance across weeks to see if it's higher than any others.\n- If found, then check if it was against Denver Broncos specifically within that week.\n\n\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, let's find the row with the highest score in the table. The score for a game is determined by the result of the game (e.g., 'w' or 'l') followed by the score of the winning team (if any) separated by a hyphen and then the score of the losing team. For example, the score for the game on week 1 is 'l 47 - 27', where 47 is the score of the Kansas City Chiefs and 27 is the score of our team.\n\n2. Looking at row 1, we have 'l 47 - 27'. This means that our team scored 27 points, while the opposing Kansas City Chiefs scored 47 points.\n\n3. The highest score in week 1 belongs to the Kansas City Chiefs who scored 47 points against our team.\n\n4. Now let's check if this is indeed true by verifying the dates of games in weeks 1 and 14.\n\n5. Week 1 has a date of \"september 8 , 1985\" while week 14 has a date of \"december 8 , 1985\".\n\n6. Since september comes before december, we can confidently conclude that the highest-scoring game for our team did not occur during week 14.\n\n7.

This can be done by looking at the \"week\" column in the table. The last two weeks will have values of 15 and 16.\n\n### Step 2: Check if both games ended with a loss against an opponent in their home stadium\nNext, we need to check if both games (weeks 15 and 16) resulted in losses for the team against opponents in their own home stadium. This means we need to verify that the \"result\" column is 'L' (loss) and that the \"opponent\" column has a different value from the original team.\n\n### Step 3: Verify game details for week 15\nFor week 15, the team played against San Francisco 49ers in their home stadium. The result was a loss with a score of 31-19. However, this does not match our requirement since the opponent should be different from the original team.\n\n### Step 4: Verify game details for week 16\nFor week 16, the team played against Atlanta Falcons in their home stadium. Unfortunately, the result was also a loss with a score of 16-10, which means they lost to an opponent at home.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze data from step 3 and step 4 to conclude.\nSince only one out of two conditions met (at least one instance of losing to their own opponent), we can't verify that both weeks meet the stated requirement.
