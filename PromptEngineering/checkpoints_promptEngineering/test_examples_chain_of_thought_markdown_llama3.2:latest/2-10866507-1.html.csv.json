However, since the teams were swapped (perth glory as home instead of being the away team), these two rows are actually contradictory to our claim.\n\n4. **Check row 3**:\n   - Row 3 has Perth Glory as the home team.\n   - Given this is incorrect for what we're looking at, it's irrelevant since we already have an error in the date (August) being different than when Perth Glory was the away team on those dates.\n\n5. **Check row 5 and 6**:\n   - Row 5 has the date 4 August 2007 with a crowd of 5967.\n   - This row indeed shows Perth Glory as the home team, meaning they were not away on that specific day, which supports our claim that they did not fulfill the role of being the away team.\n\n6. **Check row 6**:\n   - Row 6 has the date 12 August 2007 and Perth Glory as the away team with a crowd of 9606.\n   - This is the second instance where Perth Glory was indeed the away team on one of the specified dates, supporting our claim that \"perth glory be the away team on 4 august 2007 and on 12 august 2007\".\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\" }\n  ]\n}",
