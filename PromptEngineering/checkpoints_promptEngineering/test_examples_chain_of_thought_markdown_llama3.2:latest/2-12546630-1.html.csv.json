Similarly, on May 11, Alfredo Binda was in second place when Jef Demuysere passed him to become race leader.\n\n3. **Locate the specific dates mentioned in the claim**: The claim states that Ettore Meini won three races \"on May 24th, 25th and 26th\".\n\n4. **Check if Ettore Meini won any of these dates' races**:\n    - On May 24th: In the table, it's mentioned that Ettore Meini was the winner on this date.\n    - On May 25th: The table also shows that Ettore Meini won on this day.\n    - On May 26th: Again, Ettore Meini took first place.\n\n5. **Verify if there were three consecutive race victories for Ettore Meini**: As per the information in step 3 and 4, there are indeed races where Ettore Meini came first on each of these days (24th, 25th, and 26th). However, it would need further confirmation that he didn't lose any race during this period to claim three consecutive wins.\n\n6. **Consider the context of the entire Giro d'Italia**: The table only covers part of the races; a full overview is necessary for accuracy but given, we can only verify based on provided data.\n\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Checking the race leaders' numbers\",\n      \"description\": \"Checking if Ettore Meini won three races consecutively\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Finding Ettore Meini's wins\",\n      \"description\": \"Verifying that he won each of May 24th, 25th and 26th\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is FALSE because there is insufficient data to conclude that Ettore Meini won three consecutive races on May 24th, 25th and 26th in the Giro d'Italia.",
