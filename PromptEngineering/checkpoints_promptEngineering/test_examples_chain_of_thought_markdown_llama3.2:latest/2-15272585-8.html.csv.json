To verify this claim, we need to analyze the table to determine if there's any instance where she won or lost by a difference of exactly 4 points.\n3. We'll start by examining her losses in the table:\n   - In the Tipton tournament (28 January 2003), she lost with a score of 6-4, 4-6, 4-6. This means the total point difference is not 4, but rather 8 points.\n   - In the Mont-de-Marsan tournament (29 June 2003), she won with a score of 6-4, 6-2. This shows she won by a margin of 6 points, not 4.\n   - In the Latina tournament (3 October 2003), she lost with a score of 3-6, 4-6. The total point difference is again not 4, but 9 points.\n   - In the Pittsburgh tournament (8 November 2005), she also lost with a score of 6-7, 4-6. This is another loss where the point difference was not 4, but rather 11 points.\n   - In the Cuneo, Italy tournament (6 June 2006), she won with a score of 6-1, 6-2. The margin of victory is 7 points, which again does not match the claim.\n\n4. From these instances, we can see that Galina Voskoboeva's losses do not show a consistent difference of exactly 4 points.\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that, on average, Galina Voskoboeva loses to only 4 points against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\n\n2. **Find relevant data**:\n   - We need to check the scores of Galina Voskoboeva's matches against both Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\n   - According to the table, the relevant matches are:\n     * Winner: Galina Voskoboeva vs. Oleksandra Kravets on 29 June 2003 with a score of 6-4, 6-2\n     * Runner-up: Galina Voskoboeva vs. Alice Canepa on an unspecified date with an unknown score\n\n3. **Analyze the relevant matches**:\n   - For Oleksandra Kravets, we have one match where Galina Voskoboeva loses 4 points (6-4, 4-6, 4-6).\n   - For Alice Canepa, since there's only information on her being a runner-up and not the score, we cannot directly assess the average number of points lost.\n\n4. **Assess the claim**:\n   - Without the score for Galina Voskoboeva vs. Alice Canepa, we can't make an accurate assessment about the average loss to only 4 points against both opponents.\n   - However, it's clear that there's at least one documented instance of Galina Voskoboeva losing 4 points against Oleksandra Kravets.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the information, we can't make a definitive conclusion about the average loss to only 4 points because crucial data (the score against Alice Canepa) is missing.\n   - However, since one instance exists, we cannot categorically say the claim is FALSE based on available information alone. \n\n6. **Final Judgment**:\n   - Given that at least one documented instance exists and there's no clear evidence to refute it with averages across all matches for both opponents due to lack of data, we have to rely on this singular case.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"1\", \"text\": \"Identify the claim\"},\n    {\"step\": \"2\", \"text\": \"Find relevant data for Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa matches\"},\n    {\"step\": \"3\", \"text\": \"Analyze scores of the relevant matches\"},\n    {\"step\": \"4\", \"text\": \"Assess if we can accurately make a claim without one of the match's score\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",
