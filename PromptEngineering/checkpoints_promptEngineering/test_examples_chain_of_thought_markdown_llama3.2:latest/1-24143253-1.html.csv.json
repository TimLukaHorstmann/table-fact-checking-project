    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to determine if the claim is true:\n\n1. First, we need to find the rows corresponding to Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, and Walter Matthau in the table.\n   - The row index for Jill Ireland is 4 (row_index = 4).\n   - The column name for the year of death for Judy Garland is \"column_name\" = \"year_of_death\", and her value is 2003.\n   - The row index for Walter Matthau is 6 (row_index = 6).\n\n2. Next, we check if the year of death for Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, and Walter Matthau in the table matches the claim:\n   - For Jill Ireland: no match because her value is not 2003.\n   - For Judy Garland: exact match because her value is 2003.\n   - For Walter Matthau: exact match because his value is also 2003.\n\n3. Now, we check if all three individuals have the same year of death:\n   - Since not all three (Jill Ireland and Walter Matthau) have the same year of death, this means that at least two out of three conditions must be met for the claim to be true.\n\n4. Based on step 3, since we know Judy Garland has a match but Jill Ireland does not, the only remaining condition is to check if Walter Matthau also matches:\n   - As seen in step 2, yes, he does.\n   \n5. Since both conditions are met (Judy Garland and Walter Matthau have the same year of death), this means that at least two out of three individuals have the same year of death.\n\n6. Finally, we can conclude whether the claim \"jill ireland , judy garland and walter matthau all die in the year 2003\" is true or false:\n   - The claim is false because not all of the listed celebrities (Jill Ireland) have the same year of death as the other two.\n\nHere's a JSON response that represents our thought process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Step 1\": \"Identify relevant rows\",\n    \"Step 2\": \"Check if Judy Garland matches the year of death\",\n    \"Step 3\": \"Compare Jill Ireland and Walter Matthau to Judy Garland's match\",\n    \"Step 4\": \"Determine if at least two out of three conditions are met\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year_of_death\", \"value\": 2003},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year_of_death\", \"value\": 2000},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year_of_death\", \"value\": 2009}\n  ]\n}\n```",
