    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim about Kristofer Martin being nominated for the 3rd act award in 2012 and winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\n\n2. To verify the claim, we need to check if Kristofer Martin was indeed nominated for a 3rd act award in 2012 and also won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012 or any other year.\n\n3. Looking at the table, there is no row that mentions a '3rd act award' category. However, we can see that the table has awards from different organizations such as Young Critics Circle Awards, PMPC Star Awards for Movies, Famas Awards, and so on.\n\n4. We need to find out if Kristofer Martin was nominated for any of these awards in 2012 and won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\n\n5. The 'German moreno youth achievement award' is mentioned under 'famas awards', which has a column named \"n / a\" for the year, but there is another award called \"german moreno youth achievement award\" with the same information and it shows that Kristofer Martin won this award in 2012.\n\n6. However, we also need to check if Kristofer Martin was nominated for any awards in 2012. Looking at the table again, there are mentions of 'nominated' but only for specific categories like \"best performance\" under The Young Critics Circle Awards and a separate category called \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" under Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards.\n\n7. After rechecking all columns, we see that Kristofer Martin was nominated for the \"best performance\" award but did not win it in 2012. However, he did win another specific award, and there is a row for 2013 where he won multiple awards including \"Honorable mention for best supporting actor\", and also another category called \"new movie actor of the year\".\n\n8. We can now conclude that Kristofer Martin was nominated for some categories in 2012 but did not win any '3rd act award'. He did however win the German moreno youth achievement award.\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"n / a\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To verify this, we need to find all instances where \"Oros\" is mentioned as a nominated work or category.\n\nStep 2: Locate the rows in the table where Oros is mentioned as a nominated work.\nLooking at the table, we can see that there are three instances where \"Oros\" is mentioned:\n- In the 10th Golden Screen Awards row, it says \"best actor in a supporting role\" for Oros.\n- In the 1st Sunday All Stars Awards row, it says \"stand out season performer\" and has no nominated work listed.\n- In the 16th Long Island International Film Expo row, it mentions an honorable mention for best supporting actor for Oros.\n\nStep 3: Verify that these instances are indeed nominations for Kristofer Martin's performance in Oros.\nIn the 10th Golden Screen Awards row, Oros is mentioned as a nominated work. In the 16th Long Island International Film Expo row, Oros has an honorable mention. However, we can't confirm if this was specifically for Kristofer Martin's performance without more information.\n\nStep 4: Check if there are any other rows that could indicate nominations for Kristofer Martin's performance in Oros.\nIn the 1st Sunday All Stars Awards row, it says \"none\" as a nominated work. In the 28th PMPc Star Awards for Movies row, it mentions Tween Academy : Class of 2012 as a nominated category, which is not relevant to Kristofer Martin's performance in Oros.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the claim is true or false based on the verified nominations.\nBased on our analysis, we have found at least two instances where \"Oros\" is mentioned as a nominated work:\n- 10th Golden Screen Awards\n- 16th Long Island International Film Expo\n\nTherefore, the claim that 3 of Kristofer Martin's award nominations are for his performance in Oros seems to be partially true.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

According to the table, this occurs in the following rows:\n- 2013, 10th golden screen awards\n- 2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards\n\n### Step 3: Check the category for each relevant row\nFor the first row (2013, 10th golden screen awards), the category is \"best actor in a supporting role\", which does not seem to be related to performance. However, we need to look at the other rows.\n \n For the second row (2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards), the category is indeed \"best performance\".\n\n### Step 4: Check if Kristofer Martin's nomination for Oros was in any of these categories\nAccording to the table, the award giving body and result do not matter for this question. What matters is whether Kristofer Martin was nominated for his role as Oros.\n\nFrom the two relevant rows, we can see that:\n- In 2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards, Kristofer Martin was indeed nominated for \"best performance\" (category), which is related to performance.\n- However, there is a second relevant row with category standing out season performer but no nomination. \n\nSo, not all of his nominations were for the same role.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, we can see that Kristofer Martin's award nominations did include some performances in Oros, but they were not all for the same performance.\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify column names in table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Determine which row to examine for Kristofer Martin's nominations\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Check category for each relevant row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check if Kristofer Martin's nomination for Oros was in any of these categories\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the award-winning years between 2012 and 2013.\n   Looking at the table, we see that Kristofer Martin won awards in both 2012 and 2013.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine if any of these awards were based on nominations for a specific show.\n   We know from the question statement that if this is true then all his wins between 2012 and 2013 must be based on nominations.\n\n3. Checking Kristofer Martin's award categories in both years:\n   In 2012, he was nominated for \"The Young Critics Circle Awards\" for Best Performance, where he was nominated for a specific show.\n   In 2013, we see that Kristofer won awards at \"16th Long Island International Film Expo\" and \"10th Golden Screen Awards\". \n\n4. After verifying the award categories of both years in question, it is clear that two out of three awards were based on nominations for specific shows: \n   - For 2012 (The Young Critics Circle Awards) where he was nominated for \"Best Performance\", implying a nomination for a show.\n   - And both awards from 2013.\n\n5. Therefore we can deduce that the statement is true since two out of three award-winning years between 2012 and 2013 were based on nominations for specific shows.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identifying years Kristofer Martin won awards in both 2012 and 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Determining the validity of the statement by verifying if all Kristofer's award wins between 2012 and 2013 were based on nominations for specific shows.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Checking Kristofer Martin's award categories in both years: The Young Critics Circle Awards (2012)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Verifying the award categories of both years: 16th Long Island International Film Expo and 10th Golden Screen Awards (2013)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Deducing that the statement is true since two out of three award-winning years between 2012 and 2013 were based on nominations for specific shows.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",
