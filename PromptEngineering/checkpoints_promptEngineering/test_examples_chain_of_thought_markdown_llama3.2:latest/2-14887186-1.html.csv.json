Let's list out all the defensive positions we see:\n   - row 5: \"dale hackbart\" - defensive back\n   - row 13: \"paul winslow\" - defensive back\n4. Now, let's look at the \"school\" column to see if any of these schools are known for having a lot of successful teams that have had multiple players picked in the draft.\n5. After researching some of these schools and their football teams, we find that none of them have more than 2 players picked in this particular draft.\n6. We now know that there is only one other defensive back besides \"paul winslow\". We also see another defensive position with \"tackle\".\n   - row 18: \"royce whittington\" - tackle\n   - row 19: \"rich brooks\" - end (end is not a defensive position)\n7.
