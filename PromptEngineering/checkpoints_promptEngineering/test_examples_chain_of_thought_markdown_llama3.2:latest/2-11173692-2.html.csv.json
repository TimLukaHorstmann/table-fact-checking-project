    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. The claim to be evaluated is \"there be 9 more song do in english than in serbian\".\n2. To verify this, we need to compare the number of songs performed in English with the number of songs performed in Serbian.\n3. First, let's count the number of songs performed in English: \n   - cell (4): 36\n   - cell (7): 96\n   - cell (10): 42\n   - cell (14): 139\n   - cell (15): 27\n   - cell (16): 79\n   - cell (18): 135\n   - cell (19): 156\n   Total English songs: 36 + 96 + 42 + 139 + 27 + 79 + 135 + 156 = 650\n4. Next, let's count the number of songs performed in Serbian:\n   - cell (1): 23\n   - cell (3): 8\n   - cell (13): 72\n   Total Serbian songs: 23 + 8 + 72 = 103\n5. Now we compare the two counts to determine if there are indeed 9 more songs performed in English than in Serbian.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our step-by-step reasoning, since the total number of English songs (650) is greater than the total number of Serbian songs (103), it can be confirmed that there are indeed 9 more songs performed in English than in Serbian. \n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"language\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Determine what to compare with: We need to find out which language(s) have less than 3 song entries.\n3. Sort or filter the data: To do this, we can sort the table by \"points\" in ascending order (since there's no direct comparison for the number of songs in each language).\n\n4. Look at the sorted table:\n|   draw | language                   | artist                | song                     |   place |   points |\n|-------:|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:-------------------------|--------:|---------:|\n|      2 | hebrew , english           | boaz ma'uda           | the fire in your eyes    |       5 |      104 |\n|      7 | english                    | elnur and samir       | day after day            |       6 |       96 |\n|      3 | serbian , german , finnish | kreisiraadio          | leto svet                |      18 |        8 |\n|      9 | english                    | maria haukaas storeng | hold on be strong        |       4 |      106 |\n|     10 | english                    | isis gee              | for life                 |      10 |       42 |\n|     11 | english , french           | dustin the turkey     | irelande douze pointe    |      15 |       22 |\n|     12 | english , catalan          | gisela                | casanova                 |      16 |       22 |\n|     13 | bosnian                    | laka                  | poku\u0161aj                  |       9 |       72 |\n|     14 | english , armenian         | sirusho               | q\u00e9l\u00e9 , q\u00e9l\u00e9 (\u0584\u0565\u056c\u0565 \u0584\u0565\u056c\u0565)  |       2 |      139 |\n|     15 | english                    | hind                  | your heart belongs to me |      13 |       27 |\n|     16 | finnish                    | ter\u00e4sbetoni           | miss\u00e4 miehet ratsastaa   |       8 |       79 |\n|     17 | romanian , italian         | nico and vlad         | pe - o margine de lume   |       7 |       94 |\n|     18 | english                    | dima bilan            | believe                  |       3 |      135 |\n|     19 | english                    | kalomira              | secret combination       |       1 |      156 |\n\n4.5. Check if English has less than 3 song entries:\nEnglish indeed does not have more than 3, however it is also present in many others languages with only one or two entries.\n So we need to look for another language that have the least number of songs.\n\n4.6 Identify a language that has the least number of song entries:\nThe language \"serbian , german , finnish\" (draw #3) and \"bosnian\" (draw #13) both have only 1 entry with some languages having just one or two but no other.",

We will check other rows as well to ensure all possible cases are considered.\n\n3. **Check Each Row for Scores Greater Than 100**:\n   - For each row, we need to verify if the song score exceeds 100 points.\n   - Upon checking, it is noticed that in addition to rows 16 and 17, there are two more values above 100 (rows 13 and 19) which both have a value of 72 and 156 respectively.\n\n4. **Conclude**: Based on our findings from the previous step, none of the song scores exceed 100 points.\n\n5. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found no row with a score above 100, it can be concluded that the claim is correct.\n\n6. **JSON Output**:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Identify relevant cells\",\n      \"description\": \"Looking at table to find rows where song scores are greater than 100\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Find row with score greater than 100\",\n      \"result\": \"Rows 16 and 17 have lower values, 79 and 94 respectively.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check other rows for higher scores\",\n      \"description\": \"Verify all possible cases to ensure accuracy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Rows 13 and 19 also exceed the score of 100 (72 and 156 respectively)\",\n      \"result\": \"Two more values found above 100, confirming previous findings.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"No row exceeds 100 points\",\n      \"description\": \"Given no scores exceed 100\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the total number of rows (song scores) in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 19 rows in total.\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of song scores that are less than 100 points.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the following song scores are less than 100 points:\n- 23 (less than 100)\n- 8 (less than 100)\n- 5 (less than 100)\n- 36 (less than 100)\n- 5 (less than 100)\n- 16 (less than 100)\n- 8 (less than 100)\n- 72 (less than 100)\n- 27 (less than 100)\n- 79 (less than 100)\n- 94 (less than 100)\n- 36 (less than 100)\n\nSo, there are 13 song scores that are less than 100 points.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of song scores that are less than 100 points out of all song scores.\n\nPercentage = (number of song scores less than 100 / total number of song scores) * 100\n= (13 / 19) * 100\n= 68.42%\n\nSince the percentage is more than 50%, it means more than half of the song scores are less than 100 points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations, we can conclude that less than half of the song scores are indeed less than 100 points. The rest score more.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"Total number of rows (song scores)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"Count the number of song scores that are less than 100 points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"Calculate the percentage of song scores that are less than 100 points out of all song scores\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}",
