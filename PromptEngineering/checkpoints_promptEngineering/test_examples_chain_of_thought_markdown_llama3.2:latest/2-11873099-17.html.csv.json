Looking at the table, we can see the date column which lists each match's date.\n3. We'll go through each row in the table and check if the year mentioned in the \"date\" column is 2007.\n4. The rows that have a date in 2007 will be considered as matches played in 2007.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n- **Step 1**: Check the first match's date (28 jul 2006) which is not in 2007, so we move on to the next one.\n- **Step 2**: The second match's date (6 aug 2006) also not in 2007. We keep moving.\n- **Step 3**: The third match's date (9 aug 2006) is still before 2007.\n- **Step 4**: Moving on to the fourth match, its date (12 aug 2006) is again before 2007.\n- **Step 5**: Now we get to the fifth match with a date of 24 apr 2007. Since this is in 2007, it's one of our matches.\n- **Step 6**: We move on to the sixth match, and its date (20 jun 2007) also falls within 2007.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom these steps, we can see that there are indeed two matches played in 2007.
