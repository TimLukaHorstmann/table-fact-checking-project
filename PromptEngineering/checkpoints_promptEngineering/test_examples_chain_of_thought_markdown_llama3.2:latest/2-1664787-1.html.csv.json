    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. To determine whether the claim \"the first qualifying round be reach in the first and last season's\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for information about the first qualifying round.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that there are two columns of interest here: the \"round\" column, which indicates what stage a team was in during each competition, and the \"competition\" column, which identifies the type of competition being referenced. \n\n3. We need to check if any of the records show information about participating in or completing first qualifying round matches for teams in their very first season (2009-10) and last season (2012-13).\n\n4. Examining the table more closely:\n   - For 2009-10, there are indeed references to \"second qualifying round\" but no record of a \"first qualifying round\". This implies that the first qualifying round did not take place in this season's competition.\n   - However, for 2012-13, we see the \"second qualifying round\", which indicates participation in the second round. The claim seems unclear as to whether it should be about reaching the first or last qualifying round, but given what is written, we might assume it seeks information on teams beginning and ending their journey through these rounds.\n\n5. Upon further review of the table:\n   - In 2009-10, the team zrinjski mostar reached \"second qualifying round\", indicating they were still in early stages.\n   - By contrast, for 2012-13 we see that a different team, videoton, was also in a similar stage but this time with no definitive completion date indicated (it is marked as \"(a)\" which signifies an uncompleted match due to circumstances beyond the control of the club. The \"1 pt\" suggests they completed some portion and possibly won this particular game if considering aggregate points.) This does suggest participation, albeit potentially incomplete.\n\n6. Based on these observations:\n   - Since there's no clear data in 2009-10 about teams reaching a first qualifying round (indicating that the rounds typically start after an initial season), we must rely more heavily on the later period to assess the claim.\n   - For 2012-13, despite some ambiguity regarding completion of certain matches due to external factors, there is still evidence of participation in early stages.\n\n7. With these observations in mind:\n   - The table does not explicitly support that any team reached a first qualifying round for their very first season (2009-10) and, on the basis of what's available, does suggest some level of progression during later seasons.\n\n8.
