    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify games where no goal was scored by either side.\n2. We will review the table row by row, examining each game's result.\n3. In a match with \"result\" of 0-0, there is no score for either team, indicating no goals were scored.\n4. For matches with results other than 0-0, we need to verify if both teams did not score any goals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued:\n\n1. Looking through the table, we identify some games where one side scores and the other does not (e.g., a team winning 1-0).\n2. We also find several matches that ended in draws with no clear winner having scored more than the other.\n3. For these draws:\n   * Verify that neither team was ahead at any point during the match.\n   * Confirm there were no red cards or penalties awarded, thus no goals were scored via those means.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Finalized:\n\n1. After reviewing each game's result and ensuring that both teams did not score in these draw scenarios:\n   - We can confidently identify which games had no goal scored by either side.\n2. Count the number of such matches to determine if there are indeed 4 different games where this occurred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Conclusion:\n\n1. After thorough examination, we find that:\n    * There were at least 3 instances where one team won without scoring and the other did not score (due to a draw).\n    * We need to confirm if all these can be attributed to either side failing to score.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Final Answer Calculation:\n\n1. After re-examining the results, we find that indeed there are 3 games with draws where no team scored more than the other.\n2. These include:\n    - Huddersfield Town vs Crystal Palace (0-0 draw).\n    - Grimsby Town vs Queens Park Rangers (0-0 draw).\n    - West Bromwich Albion vs Crystal Palace (0-0 draw).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Final Answer:\n\n1. There are indeed 3 different games with no goal scored by either team in a match, but we were asked to verify if there were exactly 4 such instances.\n2. After verifying, it seems there might have been an oversight initially, as the question specifically asks for \"differnt game\" implying that we need to confirm the count meets the condition of at least 4 games.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Final Answer Conclusion:\n\n1. Based on the final verification:\n    - There are indeed more than the initially found instances.\n2. Specifically, there is another match with a 0-0 result not previously accounted for in our initial finding.\n3. Thus, we can conclude that indeed, there are more than 3 such games but must accurately count them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Final Answer Recount:\n\n1. After re-examining all results carefully:\n    - There is indeed a 4th game where both teams failed to score, adding to the initial count.\n2. The additional match that meets the criteria:\n    - Burnley vs Crystal Palace (1-0 win by Burnley, but this was an error in reasoning initially; however, we're focusing on draws here for the purpose of our answer).\n3. Correcting our approach and focusing strictly on draw outcomes without wins or losses for either team gives us back to 2 such games as initially correctly identified.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Final Answer Conclusion:\n\n1. Upon a thorough recount:\n    - We realized there were indeed only 2 matches out of the initial findings that were accurate in our step-by-step process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Final Answer Correction:\n\n1. Realizing the error in counting and focusing strictly on outcomes where both teams failed to score gives us a clear answer.\n2. The two verified games are:\n    - Huddersfield Town vs Crystal Palace (0-0 draw).\n    - Grimsby Town vs Queens Park Rangers (0-0 draw).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Final Answer:\n\n1. Correctly counting the instances:\n    * There are indeed only 2 different games where no goal was scored by either side.\n2. Therefore, the claim that \"there be 4 differnt game where no goal be score by either side\" is false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify games with no goals scored\",\n      \"description\": \"Review the table for draws and outcomes where one team wins without scoring.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify draw scenarios\",\n      \"description\": \"Ensure neither team was ahead at any point during these matches to confirm no clear winner.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Re-examine initial findings\",\n      \"description\": \"Confirm the number of games meeting the criteria based on detailed review.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Realize undercounting and re-evaluate\",\n      \"description\": \"Acknowledge an error in counting specific outcomes where no clear winner was recorded.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Correctly recount verified matches\",\n      \"description\": \"Ensure accurate counting based on the criteria of both teams failing to score.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Huddersfield Town vs Crystal Palace\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Grimsby Town vs Queens Park Rangers\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identify games with no goals scored\", \"description\": \"Review the table for draws and outcomes where one team wins without scoring.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Verify draw scenarios\", \"description\": \"Ensure neither team was ahead at any point during these matches to confirm no clear winner.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Re-examine initial findings\", \"description\": \"Confirm the number of games meeting the criteria based on detailed review.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Realize undercounting and re-evaluate\", \"description\": \"Acknowledge an error in counting specific outcomes where no clear winner was recorded.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Correctly recount verified matches\", \"description\": \"Ensure accurate counting based on the criteria of both teams failing to score.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Huddersfield Town vs Crystal Palace\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Grimsby Town vs Queens Park Rangers\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

So we are interested in rows that start with:\n19/02/01 - 28/03/01-30/03/01```\n\nStep 3: Check for consecutive matches on the same day \nWe need to check if there is at least one match in March where the difference between two consecutive dates is less than or equal to 1 day. \n\n```markdown\nStep 4: Check for shorter time differences between two matches\nThe condition that must be met for our claim to be true is that the shortest difference between two consecutive matches will be exactly 2 days.\nWe can check this by taking each match and comparing it with all other subsequent matches to see if there are any instances where a date differs by only one day from another. \nHowever, since we know the dates in chronological order are:\n19/02/01-28/03/01, checking every single possible combination will be too long.\n```\n\nStep 5: Check for consecutive matches with a difference of 2 days\nSince March has 31 days and only one match can take place each day, we know that there must be at least one date in March where two consecutive dates differ by exactly 2 days.
