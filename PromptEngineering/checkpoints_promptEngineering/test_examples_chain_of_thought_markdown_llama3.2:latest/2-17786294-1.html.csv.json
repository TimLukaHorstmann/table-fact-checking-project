Then, we will check if As Monaco scored the most goals in the round of 16.\n\nTo do this:\n- We look at the 2nd column (\"score\") and find the value for As Monaco's results in both rounds of 16: \n    - The first round is '2 - 0'\n    - The second round is '4 - 1'.\n3. Now we need to compare these values with those of other teams' results in the same two rounds.\n- For the team \"stade lavallois\" the result was 1-3 in the second round \n    - We can see this value is more than As Monaco's\n- For the team \"fc mulhouse\" the result was 2 - 2 in the second round. \n    - This value is less than or equal to As Monaco's.\n4. Since we did not check every team, it would be best to look at the first round as well. But for this problem only one team will have a higher score and that \"stade lavallois\" has 1-3 in the second round and thus we can conclude he had more goals scored than As Monaco.\n5. Therefore, As Monaco does not have the highest number of goals scored in the round of 16 of the Coupe de France.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In this case, we see that they played in a \"0 - 0\" first round match and ended up with a tie of 4-4 after two rounds.\n\n### Step 3: Check if the score is correct for a tie\nFor two matches to be tied on aggregate, both teams must have scored an equal number of goals. In this case, fc nantes has scored 4 goals, while olympique lyonnais also has 4 goals, so they are indeed tied.\n\n### Step 4: Verify if the claim is correct\nThe claim states that a tie should be decided by the away goal rule. According to this rule, the team that scores first in a match at the opposing team's home ground wins the match. Since both teams have scored an equal number of goals overall, we need to determine if they would still tie if we apply this rule.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the first round match\nIn the first round match, fc nantes and olympique lyonnais played at a neutral location (0 - 0). This result does not provide any information about who scored first in a home ground match.\n\n### Step 6: Draw conclusion\nBased on the given data, we cannot definitively say that fc nantes and olympique lyonnais would tie if we apply the away goal rule. However, since they are already tied on aggregate with no other teams having more goals than them, it is reasonable to conclude that their match should indeed be decided by the away goal rule.\n\n### Step 7: List relevant cells\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that there are two relevant cells, one for each match.",

For this, we'll look at the `score` column and filter rows where the score is greater than 0 (indicating an away team's goal).\n\n3. **Count Away Team Goals**: After filtering the rows, count how many goals were scored by away teams.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.\n| row_index | column_name      |\n|-----------|------------------|\n| 0         | score            |\n| 0         | team             |\n| 1         | score            |\n| 2         | score            |\n| 3         | score            |\n| 4         | score            |\n| 5         | score            |\n| 6         | score            |\n\nThe `score` column contains the score for each match.\n\n2.\n| row_index | team                    | 1st round   | 2nd round    |\n|:----------|:------------------------|:------------|:------------|\n| 0         | rc lens (d1)              | 1 - 0       | 0 - 0       |\n| 1         | fc rouen (d1)             | 1 - 0       | 1 - 3       |\n| 2         | as monaco (d1)            | 2 - 0       | 4 - 1       |\n| 3         | girondins de bordeaux (d1) | 0 - 1       | 2 - 2       |\n| 4         | fc nantes (d1)             | 0 - 0       | 4 - 4       |\n| 5         | as cannes (d2)             | 3 - 0       | 1 - 1       |\n| 6         | sporting toulon var (d1)   | 2 - 0       | 0 - 1       |\n| 7         | fc metz (d1)               | 4 - 0       | 1 - 1       |\n\nFilter rows where `score` is greater than 0.\n\n3.\n| row_index | team                    | 1st round   | 2nd round    |\n|:----------|:------------------------|:------------|:------------|\n| 1         | fc rouen (d1)             | 1 - 0       | 1 - 3       |\n| 2         | as monaco (d1)            | 2 - 0       | 4 - 1       |\n| 5         | as cannes (d2)             | 3 - 0       | 1 - 1       |\n| 6         | sporting toulon var (d1)   | 2 - 0       | 0 - 1       |\n\nCount away team goals in the 2nd round: \n\n- `fc rouen` scored 1 goal.\n- `as monaco` scored 4 goals.\n- `as cannes` scored 1 goal.\n- `sporting toulon var` scored 0 goals.\n\nTotal goals scored by away teams = 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 6\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"Step\": \"Identify the first leg games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step\": \"Filter away teams' scores in the 2nd round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Step\": \"Count away team goals\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, we need to find the highest scoring leg for the match between FC Nantes and Besan\u00e7on RC. We can do this by comparing the scores of each team in both legs.\n\n2. The score for the first leg is 4 - 4 (equal), and the score for the second leg is 1 - 1 (also equal). Since both legs ended with an equal score, we need to look at the aggregate score.\n\n3. To calculate the aggregate score, we add up all the scores from both legs. For FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC, the aggregate score is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n4. Next, we need to find the highest scoring leg in terms of total goals scored by each team in a single leg. Since the first and second legs ended with equal scores (4-4), let's look at other matches.\n\n5. After examining all the matches, it appears that only one match had a higher score than 8 in a single leg.\n\n6. If we go to the column '1st round' we will see what is the highest aggregate from a first round match which can confirm if 4+4 = 8 is indeed the highest score or not\n\n7. Comparing with other columns like '2nd round', '3rd round' and so on in order to check our conclusion about the single leg.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing different rounds will help us determine that the single round with an aggregate of 8 corresponds to a first-round match between FC Nantes and Besan\u00e7on RC. However, since we need to verify if this is the highest scoring leg of a match (i.e., not just the aggregate score), we must compare it with other legs.\n\nGiven the provided table does not specify a higher-scoring leg within the first round for matches other than FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC and 8 total goals from two equal scores indicates an extremely high-scoring tie without more information, our reasoning should consider if 4+4 = 8 is the highest aggregate of any match but that is based on just one pair of teams.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"find the highest scoring leg for FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"compare scores of first and second legs to determine if they ended with equal score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"calculate aggregate score by adding up all scores from both legs\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"compare aggregate score with other matches to see if 4+4=8 is the highest single leg score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"verify conclusion using different rounds\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"1st round\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
