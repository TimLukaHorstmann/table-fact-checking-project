    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the rows in the table where players are mentioned to be part of the club/province Glendale Raptors:\n   The relevant row for Nese Malifa is:\n   ```markdown\n| player           | position   | date of birth (age)       |   caps | club / province   |\n|:-----------------|:-----------|:--------------------------|-------:|:------------------|\n| nese malifa      | fly - half | 24 september 1985 (age28) |     24 | glendale raptors  |\n```\n   And the relevant row for James Paterson is:\n   ```markdown\n| player           | position   | date of birth (age)       |   caps | club / province   |\n|:-----------------|:-----------|:--------------------------|-------:|:------------------|\n| james paterson   | wing       | 11 april 1987 (age26)     |     12 | glendale raptors  |\n```\n\n2. Check if there is any overlap in the clubs/provinces for both Nese Malifa and James Paterson:\n   From step 1, it's clear that both players are part of the club/province Glendale Raptors.\n\n3. Verify if either player is also mentioned to be part of another club/province (Old Blue):\n   For Nese Malifa, no mention of Old Blue in his row.\n   For James Paterson, there is a mention of \"old blue\" as one of his clubs/provinces.\n\n4. Based on steps 2 and 3, the claim appears to be partially correct regarding players playing for both Glendale Raptors and another club (Old Blue), but Nese Malifa is only part of Glendale Raptors, not Old Blue.\n\n\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step_number\": 1, \"text\": \"Identify relevant rows for Nese Malifa and James Paterson\"},\n    {\"step_number\": 2, \"text\": \"Check overlap in clubs/provinces\"},\n    {\"step_number\": 3, \"text\": \"Verify each player's club/province\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",
