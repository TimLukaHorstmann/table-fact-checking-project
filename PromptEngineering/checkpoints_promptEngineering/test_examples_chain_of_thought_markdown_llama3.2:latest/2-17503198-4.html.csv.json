We can do this by looking at the \"round\" column, which seems to indicate the competition level (e.g., \"2008 uefa intertoto cup\", \"2008 - 09 uefa champions league\", etc.).\n\n#### Step 2: Check if there are any matches from the Belarusian Premier League in the table\nUpon examining the table, we notice that there is only one row that corresponds to a competition level related to the Belarusian Premier League: the first qualifying round. Specifically, the rows for \"first qualifying round\" contain teams from Belarus.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if any of these matches have an aggregate score of 4 - 1\nWe can now check the \"agg\" column in the relevant rows to see if there is a match with an aggregate score of 4 - 1. Specifically, we are looking for either a team from Belarus that has won or lost with this score against another team.\n\n#### Step 4: Check each row in the first qualifying round\nIn the \"first qualifying round\" rows, we need to check both legs (1st leg and 2nd leg) to see if any of them have an aggregate score of 4 - 1. Specifically, we are looking for either a team from Belarus that has won or lost with this score against another team.\n\n#### Step 5: Output the result\nAfter checking each row in the first qualifying round, I can conclude that there is indeed only one match where the aggregate score is 4 - 1:\n\n* \"first qualifying round\" -> \"Legia Warszawa\" -> 0 - 0 (1st leg) + 4 - 1 (2nd leg)\n* \"first qualifying round\" -> \"Mtz - Ripo Minsk\" -> 2 - 2 (1st leg) + 0 - 1 (2nd leg)\n\nThe match between Legia Warszawa and Mtz - Ripo Minsk has an aggregate score of 4 - 1. \n\n#### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identify the relevant information\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Check if there are any matches from the Belarusian Premier League in the table\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Check if any of these matches have an aggregate score of 4 - 1\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Check each row in the first qualifying round\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Output the result\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",
