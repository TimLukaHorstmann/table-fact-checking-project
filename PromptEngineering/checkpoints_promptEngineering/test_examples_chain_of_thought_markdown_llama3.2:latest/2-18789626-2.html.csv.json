First, we need to identify which teams joined after 1970.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns for this task are \"year joined\", \"year left\". The team with the most recent year joined will be the one that joined last and thus is likely the only one to join after a certain date. \n\n2. We then look at each row in the table that corresponds to a year greater than 1970, which are rows 13-15.\n\nFor Row 13:\n- \"year joined\" = 1975\n- \"year left\" = 1997\n\nRow 14:\n- \"year joined\" = 1970\n- \"year left\" = 1993\n\nRow 15:\n- \"year joined\" = 1970\n- \"year left\" = 1997\n\n3. Since both row 13 and row 15 are for teams that joined before or at the same year as 1975, which also meets our criteria of joining after 1970.\n\n4. Now we need to confirm if there is another team in the table with a \"year joined\" greater than 1975. This would mean mavericks aren't alone and wouldn't be true.\n\nThe relevant rows are row 12:\n- \"year joined\" = 1947\nRow 11: \n- \"year joined\" = 1948\n\nSince both row 11 and row 12 have years less than 1975, this means that mavericks aren't the only team to join after 1970.\n\n5. The final relevant cells are:\n{\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"year joined\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 14,\n    \"column_name\": \"year joined\"\n},\n{\n    \"row_index\": 15,\n    \"column_name\": \"year left\"\n}\n\n6.

The first step is to identify the year Rossville school joined the conference.\n   - The table shows that the row for Rossville (rossville) has columns for \"year joined\" which is 1947.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out when Rossville left the conference.\n   - Since it was part of the conference from 1947 until a certain year and stays until 1977, it can be deduced that it must have left in 1977 because there's no other specified date after leaving for which the team has been active.\n\n3. Now we check how long Rossville stayed with the league.\n   - We've established it joined in 1947 and left in 1977.\n   - So, to calculate how many years it was in the conference, we take the year it left (1977), subtract it from the year it joined (1947) which is 30.\n\n4. Based on our results:\n   - Rossville school joined in 1947 and stayed for 30 years until 1977.\n   - The claim says it joined in 1958 and left 10 years later.\n   - If we join in the year given by the claim (1958) and calculate how long it stays, adding 10 to that results in 1968.\n\n5. Based on our calculations:\n   - Rossville indeed was part of the conference from its joining in 1947 till it left in 1977.\n   - The claim's timeline does not match as it said leaving 10 years after joining in 1958, which should have been 1968, but we know it stayed until 1977.\n\n6.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Determine the row for Winamac**: To evaluate the claim, we need to find the row for Winamac in the table.\n2. **Identify relevant columns**: We need to identify the year joined (4th column) and year left (6th column) for both Winamac and Southwestern to compare their join times.\n3. **Extract values from Winamac row**:\n\t* Year joined: 1947\n\t* Year left: 1972\n4. **Extract values from Southwestern row**:\n\t* Year joined: 1958\n\t* Year left: 1966\n5. **Calculate the difference in years**: Calculate how many years after joining, Winamac actually left.\n\t* Winamac left: 1972 (12 years after the join year)\n\t* Southwestern left: 1966 (8 years after the join year)\n\t* Difference in years is not calculated here as it would be a calculation of Winamacs actual difference from southwestern. We just need to see if Winamacs time is less than or equal to that, since \"join 10 year after\" indicates we are looking at how many years they left compared to southwestern. Since 12 > 8 then winamac must have joined more recently than southwestern.\n6. **Determine the truth value**: Based on our calculations, Winamac's join time is indeed before Southwestern's join time.\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year left\"}\n  ]\n}",
