First, let's analyze the table to see if Downer Rail was built in 2009.\n   - The column \"built\" contains the year of construction for each company.\n   - In the row corresponding to Downer Rail (row_index=2), the value in the \"built\" column is \"2009\".\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Downer Rail was indeed built in 2009.\n\n2. Next, let's analyze the table to see if Pacific National was built in 2009.\n   - As mentioned earlier, the column \"built\" contains the year of construction for each company.\n   - In the row corresponding to Pacific National (row_index=3), the value in the \"built\" column is \"2009\".\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Pacific National was indeed built in 2009.\n\n3. Finally, let's evaluate the claim by combining our findings from steps 1 and 2.\n   - Since both Downer Rail and Pacific National were built in 2009, we can say that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"built\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"built\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to determine which owners have a better number in class than Downer Rail. To do this, we can compare the values of \"number in class\" for each owner with the value for Downer Rail.\n2. The number for Downer Rail is 9 (ldp001 - ldp009).\n3. Now we need to find which owners have a higher number in class than 9. We will look at the table and compare the values of \"number in class\" for each owner.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant cells:\n\n- sct logistics: 15\n- downer rail: 9 (this is not greater than 15)\n- pacific national: 34\n- whitehaven coal: 3\n- genesee & wyoming australia: 10\n\n4. Based on our comparison, we can see that Whitehaven Coal has the lowest number in class, which is less than Downer Rail's 9.\n\n5. Now let's check the other owners to ensure no one else has a better number. \n\n- sct logistics has 15, which is greater than downer rail's 9\n- genesee & wyoming australia: 10, which is also less than downer rail's 9\n\n6. So, based on our analysis, Whitehaven Coal does have the lowest value of \"number in class\", but we need to compare that with others.\n\nSince sct logistics has a higher number than whitehaven coal and genesee & wyoming australia, none of those three owners has a better number in class than whitehaven coal. \n\n- sct logistics: 15\n- downer rail: 9\n- pacific national: 34 \n- genesee & wyoming australia: 10\n\n7. However, Downer Rail is not the only owner with a lower number of \"number in class\", since we already know that genesee & wyoming australia also has a lower value.\n\n8. Now let's check if any other owners have an even better number than whitehaven coal (which has a lower number).\n\n- sct logistics: 15\n- downer rail: 9\n- pacific national: 34 \n- genesee & wyoming australia: 10\n\n9. The value of \"number in class\" for Downer Rail is indeed the lowest among those we are comparing to Whitehaven Coal.\n\nNow, considering that our claim says whitehaven coal have a better number in class than downer rail, this would be false.\n\nHere's how you can express it as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"number in class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"number in class\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"number in class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"owner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"number in class\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
