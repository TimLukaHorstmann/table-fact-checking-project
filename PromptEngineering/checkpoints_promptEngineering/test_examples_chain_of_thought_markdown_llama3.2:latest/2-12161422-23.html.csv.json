    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about Michael Tuck's career span being 3 years longer than Brad Johnson's:\n\n1. Extract the relevant information for both Michael Tuck and Brad Johnson from the table:\n   - For Michael Tuck: row_index = 1, column_name = \"career span\" -> \"1972 - 1991\"\n   - For Brad Johnson: row_index = 21, column_name = \"career span\" -> \"2011 - present\"\n\n2. Calculate the length of each career span:\n   - Michael Tuck's career span is from 1972 to 1991, which is 19 years long.\n   - Brad Johnson's career span is from 2011 to present, but since we don't know when it ended, let's assume it's an open-ended range. We can only calculate the length of time that has passed since his start date.\n\n3. Compare the lengths of the two career spans:\n   - Since Michael Tuck's career span is shorter than Brad Johnson's (19 years vs unknown), we need to know how long Brad Johnson's actual career span is in order to compare accurately.\n   - However, based on this incomplete data, it appears the claim could be false. But let's proceed with finding out more information.\n\n4. Extract the relevant information for both Michael Tuck and Brad Johnson from the table again:\n   - For Michael Tuck: row_index = 1, column_name = \"career span\" -> \"1972 - 1991\"\n   - For Brad Johnson: row_index = 21, column_name = \"games\" -> 42 (and the corresponding row has \"2012 - present\" under \"career span\")\n\n5. Calculate the length of Brad Johnson's career span:\n   - Since his games played is 42 and he started playing in 2012, we can calculate how many years he has been active: \n     - Assuming he was born around 1980-1985 (a common age for someone with 42 AFL games), let's take the average of those possible birth ranges to make a rough estimate:\n       - Assume he was born at 82.5, so as of now, that makes him around 38 years old.\n       - Subtracting his age from the current year would give us an approximation of how long he has been active: \n         - Let's assume the current year is 2024:\n           - 2024 - 38 = 1986\n           - So, as of now, Brad Johnson's career span should be approximately \"1986 - present\" which makes it around 37-38 years.\n\n6. Compare the lengths of the two career spans again:\n   - Michael Tuck's career span is from 1972 to 1991, which is 19 years long.\n   - Brad Johnson's career span is approximately from 1986 to present, which is around 37-38 years long.\n\n7. Determine whether the claim is true or false based on the comparison:\n   - The difference between Michael Tuck's and Brad Johnson's career spans is at least 18 years (38 vs 19). So, it appears that Michael Tuck's career span was not \"3 year longer\" than Brad Johnson's.",

Now, we need to find a 3-year gap between these two dates by checking if there's another date in Kevin Murray's career span that is at least 3 years after 1964.\n\n5. Since Kevin Murray also has a later range (1967-1974), let's parse this part of his range and check for the same gap.\n\n6. For the first part, 1967 is indeed 3 years after 1964.\n\n7.

For example, for the player at rank 21, their career span ends in the present day (2011 - present), so they are considered active.\n\n8.

To determine if the claim about St Kilda being the club when Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden be the player, we need to check the table for any inconsistencies.\n\n2. We can start by looking at the row where Dustin Fletcher's games are listed as 378 with a career span of 1993 - present, which indicates that he currently plays for Essendon. \n\n3. Next, we look at Simon Madden's row in the table where he also has 378 games played and a career span of 1974-1992. This means that his current club information is not clear from this data.\n\n4. To resolve the ambiguity, we need to find which player actually plays for St Kilda now.

Looking at Dustin Fletcher, he is currently playing for Essendon, not St Kilda.\n\n6.
