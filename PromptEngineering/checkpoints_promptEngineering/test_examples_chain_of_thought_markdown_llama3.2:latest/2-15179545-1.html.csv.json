To determine if this is true, we need to check if all races have a column named \"race track\" with the value \"Circuit des Nations\".\n2. Looking at the table, we see that there are three columns related to \"race track\": race track, circuit des nations, and non-championship.\n3. In the first row, both \"race track\" and \"circuit des nations\" have the same value: \"Circuit des Nations\". This suggests that these two columns might be referring to the same thing.\n4. However, in the subsequent rows, we see that only one of these columns has the value \"Circuit des Nations\". The other column (non-championship) seems to indicate whether it's a non-championship race or not.\n5. Now, looking at the values in the \"race track\" column for each row:\n- Row 1: Circuit des Nations\n- Row 2: Circuit des Nations (but Formula 2 fia, non - championship)\n- Row 3: Circuit des Nations (but Formula 2 fia, non - championship)\n- Row 4: Circuit des Nations (but Formula 1 fia, non - championship)\n6. From the above observations, we can see that while most races do take place at \"Circuit des Nations\", not all of them do.
