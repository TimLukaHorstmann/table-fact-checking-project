The \"total\" column shows us that:\n- Rank 1 has 3 medals\n- Rank 2 has 1 medal\n- Rank 3 has 2 medals\n- Rank 4 and 6 have 1 medal each\nAdding these up, we get 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate more than half of the total number of medals\nNow that we know there are 8 medals in total, we need to find out what \"more than half\" means. Half would be 8 / 2 = 4. So, \"more than half\" would mean anything above 4 medals.\n\n### Step 3: Count the medals won by the first two ranks\nNow we check how many medals were won by the first two ranks (rank 1 and rank 2). Rank 1 has 3 medals, and rank 2 has 1 medal. That means together they have 3 + 1 = 4 medals.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if more than half of the medals were won by the first two ranks\nBased on our calculations in steps 2 and 3, we see that 4 is indeed \"more than half\" of 8 (the total number of medals). Since there are 4 medals for the first two ranks combined, this means the claim that more than half of the medal was won by the first 2 rank is TRUE.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the relevant cells\nThe relevant cells to answer this question are those at row index 1 (\"Rank 1\") and row index 2 (\"Rank 2\"), which have column names \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\" and \"total\".
