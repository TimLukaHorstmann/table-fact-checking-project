This information is found in the \"engine\" column and the corresponding \"points\" column.\n\n### Step 3: Check if \"Sasol Jordan\" used Hart V10 with 1 point\nIn the table, Sasol Jordan's chassis is listed as \"jordan 193\" but this doesn't specify an engine type. However, in the instructions it does say to look for a team tie for the least amount of race, which must mean that there should be another row for the same number of points.\n\n### Step 4: Find other rows with the same points\nThe relevant \"points\" column values are: 0 (for both arrows teams and ligier), 2 (ligier blondes) and 5 and 11 and 27 and 34 and 37. There is no entry for a team using Hart V10 and having 1 point.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nSince there isn't another row with the same amount of races, but also 1 points, we have to look at other teams. The problem asks us to find out if Sasol Jordan be a team tie for the least amount of race with 1.\n\n### Step 6: Find the number of times each team has been used in the table\nThe relevant information is found by looking at how many times each team appears:\n- arrows (2)\n- barclay nordica arrows bmw (2)\n- benetton formula ltd (2)\n- canon williams team/renault (3)\n- ligier gitanes/blondes (3) \n- jordan (1)\n\n### Step 7: Check if Sasol Jordan's races are the least\nSasol Jordan raced only once, and since there is no other team that has raced only once we have to check another column. However, we can't find any other team with a single race.\n\n### Step 8: Output final answer\nSince we know that the claim asks for the teams tie for the least amount of races with 1 point, and there isn't a other team that has had one race, we should be able to conclude that this statement is TRUE.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Sasol Jordan is the team in question\", \"There are other teams which have raced more than once.\", \"No other team uses Hart V10 with 1 point\"], \n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the years with the highest number of races: Looking at the table, we can see that there are multiple years where there seems to be a high number of races, but we need to confirm this by counting the number of entries in each year.\n\n2. Count the number of entries for each year:\n   - 1984 has two entries\n   - 1985 and 1986 have one entry each\n   - 1987 and 1988 have one entry each\n   - 1989, 1990, and 1993 have one entry each\n   - 1991 has two entries\n\n3. Identify the year(s) with the most race that happen: Based on the count in step 2, we can see that both 1991 (2 races) and 1984 (2 races) are tied for having the highest number of races.\n\n4. Check if the races in any of these years occurred on 4 occasions: Looking at the table again, we can see that there is only one instance where a year has two entries (1984). For both 1991 and 1984, this single instance does not occur four times. However, for 1984, there are indeed two instances of the same team in the same year, which was incorrectly counted as separate races.\n\n5. Recount correctly: Correctly recounting that the only true instance where a race happened is the one that both teams had the same chassis in the same year. \n\nSo, we now see 1991 does happen twice and 1984 does also have two instances of the team with different engine but still having the same chassis. Both are tied for most race.\n\n6. Confirm if either of these years occurred four times: Since there is only one year where both teams had the same chassis in each year's instance, we can conclude that this occurs on 2 occasions.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the years with the highest number of races\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of entries for each year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the year(s) with the most race that happen\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the races in any of these years occurred on 4 occasions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Recount correctly\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Confirm if either of these years occurred four times\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1984,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1991,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to determine if this claim is true or false.\n\n2. **Find Relevant Information**:\n   - In the table, we are looking for information about Canon Williams (also known as Canon Williams team) and points earned in the 1989 season.\n   - The relevant cells from the table that could help us answer the question include rows with \"canon williams\" in the 'team' column.\n\n3. **Analyzing Rows**:\n   - Looking at row 8, we see that Canon Williams (also known as canon williams team) had two entries: one for FW12C and another for FW13.\n   - For both of these rows, the points are 37. This indicates that Canon Williams indeed earned 37 points in a race during 1989.\n\n4. **Analyzing Sub-Claims**:\n   - The claim mentions \"2 time earn\", which seems to be referring to the fact that there were two different cars (FW12C and FW13) that both gave the team 37 points.\n   - This is true, as we see in rows 8 and 9.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - To confirm our reasoning, let\u2019s check if any other relevant data exists in the table that could contradict or support our answer.\n   - After reviewing the entire table, we can conclude that no contradictory evidence exists.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis above, we believe that Canon Williams indeed earned 37 points in a race during 1989.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

In this case, it's about Ligier Gitanes earning 37 points in a race during 1989.\n\n2. **Find Relevant Information**:\n   - Look for rows where 'team' is 'ligier gitanes', and 'year' is 1989.\n   - Check the values in the 'points' column for these teams and years to see if any match the claim (37 points).\n\n3. **Analyze Data for Ligier Gitanes in 1989**:\n   - In 1989, there are two rows: one with Ligier Gitanes and engine Hart V10, scoring 0 points.\n   - The other row does not align with the claim since it scores a different number of points.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since only one team (Ligier Gitanes) scored points in 1989 but those points were zero, not 37 points as per the claim.\n\n5. **Finalize Answer**:\n   - The statement about Ligier Gitanes earning 37 points is false because there's no evidence of such a performance in the table for 1989.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify claim\",\n      \"text\": \"Ligier Gitanes earned 2 times, but only one race had 0 points in 1989\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find relevant information\",\n      \"text\": \"Check for Ligier Gitanes and year 1989 to see if there's any data with a score of 37 points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze the data found\",\n      \"text\": \"In 1989, Ligier Gitanes had an engine that scored them 0 points in race.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1991,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1989,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
