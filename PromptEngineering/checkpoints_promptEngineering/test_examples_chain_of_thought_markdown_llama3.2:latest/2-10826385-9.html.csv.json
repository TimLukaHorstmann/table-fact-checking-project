    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Geelong Team's Score**: Find the score for the Geelong team on May 27, 1972.\n\n   The relevant cells are:\n   - `| away team       | away team score   | ...`\n     + \"away team\" = Geelong\n     + \"away team score\" = 16.13 (109)\n\n   Since 16.13 is greater than the scores of all other teams, it confirms that their final score on May 27 was higher.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Team's Scores**:\n   Compare Geelong's final score to every other team to find if there are two teams who scored more points.\n\n   Relevant cells for comparison (excluding Geelong):\n     - `| home team   | home team score   | ...`\n       + For each team, compare \"home team score\" and \"away team score\".\n   It is required to identify which 2 teams scored a higher than Geelong's final score. \n   Upon examination of the table it is clear that there are no other scores greater or equal (in this case) than that of Geelong.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on step 2, since there is only one team that scored more points than Geelong's and only one team that scored less, there isn't exactly two teams that score higher than geelong's but we know the condition stated in the question will be met.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Identify the Geelong Team's Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Compare with Other Team's Scores\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
