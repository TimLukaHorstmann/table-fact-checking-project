Let's count the number of rows in the table up to 2012: \n   - There are no rows for 1960 that match our criteria.\n   - The first win is by Diana Ross in 1973, and there are more after that.\n   - Counting each row, we get: Diana Ross (won twice), Cicely Tyson, Diana Ross again, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg (won once), Angela Bassett, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Pam Grier, Halle Berry, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Hudson (won), Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Viola Davis, Mo'Nique (won), and Gabourey Sidibe.\n\n3. The claim says that black actresses have won only 7 awards before 2012.\n4. Let's list the row for each actress to verify: Diana Ross (nominated), Cicely Tyson (nominated), Oprah Winfrey (nominated), Whoopi Goldberg (won), Angela Bassett (won), Marianne Jean-Baptiste (nominated), Viola Davis (nominated), Mo'Nique (won), Gabourey Sidibe (nominated).\n5.

We will start by identifying the relevant years.\n\n- 1960-1968: Years 1962 and 1968 have been nominated.\n- 1975-1981: Year 1979 has been nominated but no year prior to it within this range.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate drought duration for each identified period\nTo find the longest drought between nominations, we need to determine how many years passed without a nomination in each relevant period.\n\n- For 1960-1968, there are nominations in both 1962 and 1968. Thus, no more than 6 years passed.\n- For 1975-1981, since only one year (1979) within this range was nominated but the last prior to it in 1959 doesn't count for drought calculation as that would be outside of our specified start date (1975), we can calculate from 1979 back to 1975.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if there's a longer drought period\n- From 1960-1968, the drought is less than 6 years.\n- For 1975-1981, starting from 1979 and going back to 1975, we have only 4 years before 1979.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude on the claim based on the calculations\nGiven the calculation that there's a period (1975-1981) with less than 6 years of drought between nominations and another instance where such is true but doesn't surpass in length or even start being true beyond other, we can conclude.\n\n### Step 5: Format answer according to given instructions\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identifying relevant years\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Calculating drought duration for each period\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determining if there's a longer drought period\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion based on calculations\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `chain_of_thought` section provides a step-by-step narrative of how the reasoning unfolded, while the `answer` and `relevant_cells` sections directly output the result as requested.",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the relevant information**: The claim mentions \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress.\" To determine if this is true, we need to analyze the table data related to Black actresses winning Best Actress awards at the Golden Globe Awards.\n\n2. **Analyze the table data**: From the table, we can see that there are several Black actresses who have won Best Actress awards:\n   - Diana Ross (1973) for \"Lady Sings the Blues\"\n   - Whoopi Goldberg (1993 was not Best Actress in musical/comedy but 1997 wasn\u2019t given) for \"Sister Act\" and also won in 1991 for \"Ghost\"\n   - Angela Bassett (1994) for \"What's Love Got to Do with It\"\n   - Halle Berry (2002) for \"Monster's Ball\"\n   - Viola Davis (2012) for \"The Help\"\n\n3. **Determine the frequency of wins**: To check if this is the least common award, we need to compare the number of times a Black actress has won Best Actress against other Golden Globe Awards.\n\n4. **Count the total wins**: In total, 5 Black actresses have won Best Actress awards:\n   - Diana Ross (1)\n   - Whoopi Goldberg (2)\n   - Angela Bassett (1)\n   - Halle Berry (1)\n   - Viola Davis (1)\n\n5. **Check if other awards exist in the table for Black actresses**: In addition to Best Actress, we also need to consider if there are any other Golden Globe Awards won by Black actresses that might be less common.\n\n6. **Compare with other awards**: Looking at the table again, there is another award category called \"New Star - Actress\" which was introduced in 1973 and it seems to have been awarded more frequently than Best Actress, especially since Whoopi Goldberg won this award in 1977.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given that we've identified more instances of awards given to Black actresses (including those who won the New Star - Actress category), winning an Oscar or another prestigious film award does not necessarily imply a \"least common\" event for the stated category but is a different award altogether.\n\n8. **Answer Determination**:\n   - Given that there are indeed multiple awards won by Black actresses in other categories (New Star - Actress), we can infer that winning Best Actress at the Golden Globe Awards isn't the least common award.\n   - Hence, the answer to the claim \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress\" is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"relevant_cells\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"new star - actress\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"best actress - musical or comedy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"best supporting actress\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Identify the relevant column for the award of Best Actress in Musical or Comedy: Look at the table header, we can see that the award of \"best actress - musical or comedy\" is listed under the \"award\" column.\n2. Find the rows where the award is \"best actress - musical or comedy\": We need to look for all rows where the value in the \"award\" column matches this phrase. From the table, we can see that these rows are:\n   | year | actor                    | award                            | motion picture                                 | result    |\n   | 1993 | whoopi goldberg          | best actress - musical or comedy | sister act                                     | nominated |\n   | 1994 | angela bassett           | best actress - musical or comedy | what 's love got to do with it                 | won       |\n   | 1981 | irene cara               | best actress - musical or comedy | fame                                           | nominated |\n   | 1984 | jennifer beals           | best actress - musical or comedy | flashdance                                     | nominated |\n   | 1993 | alfre woodard            | best supporting actress          | passion fish                                   | nominated |\n   | 2007 | beyonc\u00e9 knowles          | best actress - musical or comedy | dreamgirls                                     | nominated |\n3. Check if any of the winners have won this award in 1988: From our list, we can see that there is no row for the year 1988.\n4. Since there are no winners from 1988 and also no other wins after whoopi goldberg's wins except for Angela Bassett's win in 1994, the claim seems to be false.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": [2,3,6,7,10],\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
