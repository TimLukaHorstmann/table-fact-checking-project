Next, we need to check if there is another row with the same \"player\" value in any of these positions.\n5. From the table:\n   - There is no other row where \"position\" equals \"defence\", and the player has the same name as Mac Bennett (`round` = 3).\n   - However, since Michael Cichy also plays defence, this contradicts our initial assumption that there's only one defensman drafted named 'mac bennett'.\n6.

There are 3 players (Louis Leblanc, Gabriel Dumont, and Dustin Walsh).\n\n3. **Identify the number of players from Russia**: Count the rows where nationality is 'Russia'. There is only 1 player (Alexander Avtsin).\n\n4. **Calculate the combined count for Canada and Russia**: Add the counts from step 2 and step 3: $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n5. **Compare Finland's count with the combined count of Canada and Russia**: Compare the number of players from Finland (step 1) to the calculated combined count (step 4): $3 \\neq 4$.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, the claim is false because more players come from Canada and Russia combined than from Finland alone.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}",
