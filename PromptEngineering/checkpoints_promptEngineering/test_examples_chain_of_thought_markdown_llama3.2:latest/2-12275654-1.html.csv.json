Check if xu huaiwen played in the women's singles tournament from 2003 to 2006 by looking at the relevant cells in the table.\n\n2. Find the row index for 2003 and check which player won that year: dicky palyama played against xu huaiwen, so it was not a win for xu huaiwen.\n\n3. Look at the column \"women 's singles\" for each year from 2003 to 2006:\n   - In 2004, xu huaiwen lost to niels christian kaldau.\n   - In 2005, xu huaiwen won against kasper \u00f8dum.\n   - In 2006, xu huaiwen won against ronald susilo.\n\n4. Since there are years in between where xu huaiwen does not appear in the \"women 's singles\" column (for example 1998), it cannot be true that she played from 2003 to 2006.\n\n5.

To verify this, we need to check if both Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke played together in the same year in the same tournament, which is the women's doubles event.\n3. We can do this by checking the relevant columns: 'women 's doubles' and finding a row where both names appear.\n4. Looking at the table, we find that there are two rows where Helle Nielsen appears in the 'women 's doubles' column, but Marie Roepke only appears in one of them (2008).\n5. This suggests that Helle Nielsen did not play with Marie Roepke together for two consecutive years.\n6. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that there is another row where both names appear: 2009 and Helle Nielsen's name appears again in 2010 but not with Marie Roepke in the 'women 's doubles' column.\n\nHere's the relevant output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2008,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2010,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2010, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Since the claim is false, I have outputted FALSE in the answer field.",

To verify this, we need to check if Michael S\u00f8gaard played with these two players in the table.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that Michael S\u00f8gaard played with several players, including Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp. Specifically, on the row for 2000, he played with Michael Keck Christian Mohr (not exactly a doubles match) but more importantly with Michael Lamp.\n4. For the claim to be true, Michael S\u00f8gaard must have also played with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp in the men's doubles event.\n\nNow let's check if this condition is met:\n\n- We see that in 2000 Michael S\u00f8gaard played with Michael Keck Christian Mohr (a mixed doubles match), but then we notice that on the same year, he plays in mixed doubles with Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp. \n5. Since Michael S\u00f8gaard has played with both players in different types of events (mixed doubles and men's doubles event) we are confident about his presence in both the doubles.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan playing four times in the women's singles:\n\n1. First, we need to check how many times Katrin Schmidt plays in the women's singles from 1988 to 2006.\n   - From the table, we see that Katrin Schmidt played in the following years: 1988, 1989, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. That is a total of 9 times.\n\n2. Next, we need to check how many times Pi Hongyan plays in the women's singles from 1988 to 2006.\n   - From the table, we see that Pi Hongyan played in the following years: 1988, 1997, and 2000. However, since there is no entry for 1997, it seems like an error and it should be 2001 instead. That is a total of 3 times.\n\n3. Since both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan played in more than three different years, we need to check if they actually play the same year multiple times.\n   - Looking at the table, we see that from 1988 onwards, Katrin Schmidt plays only once per year. And Pi Hongyan also plays only once per year.\n\n4. Since both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan played in more than three different years, but each year has only one entry, it can be determined that Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan both play four times in the women's singles is not true.\n\n\nHere's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"1988\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"1989\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"1998\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"1999\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"2000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"2002\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"2003\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"2004\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"2005\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
