Looking at the table, we need to identify public institutions that are members of the GMAC.\n3. The table does not specify the exact name of the conference currently used by each institution.\n\nHowever, since we know there are only 5 institutions in the table and all of them have been part of the GMAC at some point (as indicated by the `joined` column), we can make a general observation:\n- There are indeed more than one public institutions that were previously members of the conference. Specifically, the University of Cincinnati, the University of Dayton and The University of Memphis were among those who joined in 1991.\n\n4. From the information available on these five institutions, there is evidence to suggest that indeed two of them can be considered as part of a \"Great Midwest Conference\", however, no direct confirmation is possible from the provided data.\n\n\n5. We do know though that The University of Cincinnati and the University of Memphis have indeed been members of the GMAC in 1991, given this information alone its sufficient to assert our claim.\n\n\n\n6. The final step is to verify whether there are any other public institutions in the table that are also members of the conference.\n- From the data provided for each of these five institutions we can see only that at least two public institution have been part of the GMAC, but no direct confirmation of all conferences participants exist.\n\n\n\n7.
