Since there are other schools that also joined earlier than Culver Community (specifically, Glenn and Jimtown both joined in 1966), we need to compare the years of Bremen's and Culver Community's membership:\n   - If Bremen joined 5 years before Culver Community, then it should have joined after 1972.\n\n5. Since Bremen joined in 1989, which is indeed after 1977 (the year that would make it 12 years behind Culver community), we can check the difference between each school's join date and see that only new prairie came closer to meeting five year criteria\n   - 1968-1977= -9\n   - 1982-1977=5\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Determine the locations of Laville and Culver Community to identify their positions within the state.\n2. Identify which region each school falls under, using the given information about county associations:\n   - Laville falls under 71 st joseph county association.\n   - Culver Community falls under 50 marshall county association.\n3. Since IHSAA regions generally divide into subgroups (such as northern and southern), determine whether both schools fall within the same region by examining their respective counties' associations, if not, the claim is FALSE because there's no regional overlap.\n\n4. Now examine enrollment numbers for each school:\n   - The claim states that Laville has a lower enrollment than Culver Community.\n   - Enrollments are as follows: \n     - Laville (413) vs Culver Community (306).\n\n5. Since 413 > 306, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"location\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"county\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 6,\n            \"column_name\": \"region association\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"enrollment comparison\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"location\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"county\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"enrollment comparison\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
