Given the specificity requested in the claim and how technical knockouts are often specified in mixed martial arts, it seems this fight may not have been officially decided by strikes.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion on relevant rows\nOnly one of Kelly's wins was explicitly stated as a TKO (strikes), against Shad Smith.

Identify all events where Kelly won by decision:\n   From the table, we can see that Kelly won twice with \"decision\" as the method: once against Nuri Shakir at IFC WC 13 - Warriors Challenge 13 and once against Rudy Vallederas is not listed as a Decision win so this one is excluded.\n\n3. Check if any of these events are the same:\n   Since we have two different events (\"Kotc 3 - Knockout Nightmare\" and \"IFC WC 13 - Warriors Challenge 13\"), it's clear that they are not the same.\n\n4. Determine if Kelly won by TKO (strikes) twice in the same event:\n   As identified earlier, Kelly won twice with \"tko (strikes)\" but both wins were at different events.\n\nTherefore, based on the table and claim provided, we can conclude:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"List all events where Kelly won by TKO (strikes)\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"List all events where Kelly won by decision\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if any of these events are the same\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if Kelly won by TKO (strikes) twice in the same event\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}",
