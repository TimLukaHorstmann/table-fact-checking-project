    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. Determine the date range for November in the table.\n\nThe dates provided are from November 1 to November 29, which encompasses the entire month of November.\n\n2. Identify the relevant game records that are considered for this claim.\n\nSince we're evaluating a record at the end of the month (November), all games played between November 1 and November 29 should be considered.\n\n3. Analyze each game's outcome to determine if it contributes positively or negatively to the final record.\n\n* Positive outcomes (W) will increase the team's win count, while negative outcomes (L) will decrease it.\n* Each game's final score is not necessary for this claim; only whether the game was won (W) or lost (L).\n\n4. Calculate the cumulative number of wins and losses after November 29.\n\nThis step involves checking if the Raptor has more wins than losses by that date.\n\n5. Compare the calculated record with the provided claim \"6 - 8 record.\"\n\nIf the team's actual record matches the claim of a 6 - 8 record, it is considered TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n* Counting W's and L's:\n\t+ From November 1 to November 16: \n      - The team played games 3, 4, 5, 10, which are a mix of wins and losses.\n      + Wins (W): Games 4, 6, 10; Loses (L): Games 3, 5, 11\n\t+ From November 19 to November 29: \n      - The team played games 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, which are mostly wins.\n      + Wins (W): Games 12, 13, 14, 15; Loses (L): Game 11\n* Calculating the Record:\n\t+ After November 16: 3 W's and 3 L's\n\t+ After November 19: Adding 2 more W's, now at 5 W's and 3 L's\n\t+ No changes after November 29 with additional wins\n\n6. Determine if the team's actual record matches or is better than the provided claim.\n\nThe team has a win record of 8 games won out of 16 played in total during November, making it not exactly \"6 - 8\" but better as per the count.\n\n\n### Final Answer JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Games with W: 6, L's 8 and games count in total from 1-29 Nov are 16 which made record to be 8W and 8L (Win/Loss Count)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This implies we need to find if the highest points scored by any player on the Raptors (not specifically listed as \"Raptors\" in the table, but inferred as they are the team being discussed) in a single game is indeed 101.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Relevant Information\nLooking at the table provided, the information regarding each game includes scores and players' points. We need to identify which player(s) on the Raptors achieved the highest score of 101.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Table for Highest Score Achieved by Raptors Player\nChecking through the table:\n- Game 10 shows a score of 101, but the player's name is given as \"Chris Bosh,\" not a Raptors player. This seems out of context based on the team name.\n- There is no direct mention of any Raptors player achieving a score of 101 in a single game.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude Based on Analysis\nSince there's no evidence provided directly within the table that a Raptors player achieved a point score of 101, and considering the ambiguity around \"Raptors\" given the team listed is actually called Minnesota, Dallas, Washington, etc., in different games, we must conclude the information does not support the claim as stated.\n\n### Step 5: Output JSON Answer\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Claim analysis identified; Step 2 & 3: No evidence of Raptors player scoring 101 found; Conclusion drawn from step 4.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player name\"} // Chris Bosh\n  ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, we need to find the maximum rebound total in any single game.\n\n2. Looking at the table, the column of interest is \"high rebounds\". We need to examine every row to find the player with the highest number of rebounds in one game.\n\n3. Starting from the top row (game 3), we can see that Jerome Williams has 16 rebounds. \n\n4. In order to verify if this is indeed the highest rebound total for a player in any single game, we should check other columns to ensure it's not higher than 16.\n\n5. Upon reviewing all the rows of \"high rebounds\", it appears that none of them exceed 16 (e.g., Jerome Williams also has 13, 11, and 9 rebounds throughout the games). \n\n6.

However, the name \"lamond murray\" is present for one instance.\n    - The highest point score mentioned in the table for a player without specifying their team (thus presumably from Toronto or not explicitly stated) is 43.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n    - Since there's no mention of the Raptor by name and at least one game where Vince Carter scores 43 points, which is higher than the claim of 99, this suggests that for this table and under these criteria, the statement might be false because the highest point score mentioned for a player from Toronto (if they were directly named) was less than what the claim asserts.\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n    - The final answer in JSON format will include our reasoning steps, whether the claim is true or false, and reference to specific rows and columns of the table that supported this determination.\n\n### Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about the most point score by a Raptor in a game being 99 was investigated by looking for games where no player was mentioned but had a high points score.
