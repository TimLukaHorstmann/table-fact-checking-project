To verify this, we need to compare the total points of both teams.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see the total points for Quer\u00e3taro in cell (16, 8) which is 39 points.\n4. We also need to calculate the average points per game played by Am\u00e9rica team as it's mentioned that they have about 10 times less points than Quer\u00e3taro.\n5. Looking at the table, we can see the total games played by Am\u00e9rica in cell (16, 7) which is 34.\n6. We can now calculate the average points per game played by Am\u00e9rica team using cell (16, 8) and cell (16, 7).\n7. average_points_per_game_america = 39 / 34 \u2248 1.1471\n8.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that the Am\u00e9rica team scored fewer points than the Quer\u00e9taro team.\n2. To verify this, we need to compare the total points of both teams. According to the table, Am\u00e9rica's total points are 136, and Quer\u00e9taro's total points are 39.\n3. Since 136 is greater than 39, Am\u00e9rica scored more points than Quer\u00e9taro.\n4. Therefore, the claim that Am\u00e9rica scored fewer points than Quer\u00e9taro is FALSE.\n\n### Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the total points of both teams to verify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Am\u00e9rica's total points are 136, and Quer\u00e9taro's total points are 39.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Since 136 is greater than 39, Am\u00e9rica scored more points than Quer\u00e9taro.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Therefore, the claim that Am\u00e9rica scored fewer points than Quer\u00e9taro is FALSE.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"total pts\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"total pts\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that the Toluca team and the Cruz Azul team tie with the same average.\n2. To verify this, we need to compare the averages of both teams. We can do this by extracting the \"avg\" values from their respective rows in the table.\n\n3. For Toluca, the relevant cell is:\n   ```\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 1,\n     \"column_name\": \"avg\"\n   }\n   ```\n   This cell has a value of `1.8529`.\n\n4. For Cruz Azul, the relevant cell is:\n   ```\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 4,\n     \"column_name\": \"avg\"\n   }\n   ```\n   This cell has a value of `1.5`.\n\n5. Now we compare these two values to determine if they are equal.\n\n6. If both values are equal, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n7. Since 1.8529 is not equal to 1.5, the teams do not have the same average.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract Toluca team average\",\n      \"value\": 1.8529\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract Cruz Azul team average\",\n      \"value\": 1.5\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the two averages\",\n      \"result\": \"Not equal\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"avg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"avg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
