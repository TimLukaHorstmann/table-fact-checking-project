Looking at the table, we see that the Argonauts played against both the Alouettes (week 11) and the Rough Riders (weeks 1 and 9).\n4.

However, we need to find out if these two instances are consecutive weeks.\n6. For the Argonauts, they did play against both Alouettes and Rough Riders in consecutive weeks (week 11), so this supports the claim.\n7.

Look for relevant information in the table: We need to find a series of games where the Argonaut loses 7 consecutive games.\n\n3. Analyze the data:\n   - There are two instances where the Argonauts play the same team multiple times (Rough Riders, Alouettes and Tiger-Cats) but we can't assume a losing streak in these cases.\n   - To identify potential losing stretches for the Argonauts, we should find sequences of games where they lost one or more consecutive matches. This information will be found on the \"final score\" column.\n\n4. Identify relevant game data:\n   - We are looking for any sequence of at least two games with a final score ending in 'L' (loss). For instance, the Argonaut can have won and then lost one or more times in between before losing again.\n\n\n5. Analyze game sequences from the \"final score\" column to find a 7-game losing streak.\n\n6. Find all instances where there is at least two consecutive losses:\n   - Game #9 (Oct 18) had an attendance of less than 20000, indicating it might have been part of a low-scoring or low-attendance event.\n   - The next game in the table for October 25 was a win. However, looking ahead to November 1st where the Argonaut lost again, but that is not two losses.\n   - Continuing analysis of games #10 and onwards shows us that from October 25th through November 1st there was a single win followed by another loss. It's still too short.\n\n7. Find further game sequences with at least 2 consecutive losses:\n   - Since the last sequence we analyzed only consisted of one game, we need to look for games where they have two or more losses.\n   - From October 11th (Game #8), onward, and then continuing on October 13th, where Argonauts won but lost the next day, shows us that there was a single win followed by another loss.\n   - Then we continue this pattern from October 18th (argonaut's win) through to November 1st. But again this doesn't show us two consecutive losses in one stretch.\n\n\n8. Finally find all instances of 2 or more consecutive losses during the same game week:\n   - Looking at our table, it is clear that no such instance exists but looking further down into the \"record\" column we can see an interesting thing - games from October 25th onward were either a win/loss or loss.\n   - However, if we look closer there are only two teams mentioned (Alouettes, Tiger-Cats and Rough Riders) in these game sequences that would show us an instance of consecutive losses. Looking back through the rest of our data we can see this sequence occurring once during October 11th and then November 1st as shown by the win and subsequent loss at games #8 and #11 respectively.\n\n\n9. Conclusion:\n   - Based on step-by-step analysis, it's clear that there is a game stretch where Argonauts lost but only 6 of their losses weren't consecutive (for example: October 25th to November 1st, which was not two losses).\n   - Therefore the claim of losing 7 in a row during one stretch does appear FALSE based on our data.",

The last game's row index can be found by looking at the \"week\" column, which corresponds to week 11. Therefore, we need to find the relevant cell with row_index = 11.\n\n2. To verify that this is indeed the largest attendance of the season, we must compare its value with those in other rows.

If we find at least one row with a larger attendance, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it is TRUE.\n\n4.

We need to identify which column contains the date information, as it might help us understand when games are played.\n\n2. **Locate Date Columns**: In the table, we can see that columns 'date', 'week' do not have a typical date range (as weeks cannot exceed 52), thus week number is likely in the \"week\" column.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the second highest attendance of the season.\n   - We can do this by sorting the `attendance` column in descending order.\n\n2. Next, we will sort the `attendance` column in descending order and get the first two values (the top two attendances).\n\n3. Then, we compare these two attendances with the attendance value of the last game.\n\n4. The claim is \"the second highest attendance of the season be in the last game\". Therefore, if the second highest attendance is indeed in the last game, then the answer will be TRUE; otherwise, it will be FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n]\n```\n\n5. Now, we can determine if the second highest attendance of the season is in the last game by comparing the attendances.\n\n6. From row 10, `attendance` = 23334.\n7. From row 11, `attendance` = 26813.\n\n8. Since 23334 < 26813, it's not equal to the second highest value.\n\n9. The claim is FALSE.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Find the top two attendances in descending order.\",\n    \"Step 2: Sort attendance column and get first two values (top two attendances).\",\n    \"Step 3: Get last game's attendance.\",\n    \"Step 4: Compare top two attendances with the last game's attendance.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",
