Check if Sony BMG appears in at least 4 different regions: The table shows Sony BMG as a label for \"argentina\", \"indonesia\", and one other region. However, upon closer inspection of the data we see the last row has a - which represents the absence of any information on a cassette release, and thus it does not represent any 'different' values.\n\n2. Check each row to ensure they are indeed different: Upon reviewing this data, we notice that Indonesia appears in two regions but one is a cassette where there is no data provided for the label, hence it should be considered as 3 unique entries, and Argentina shares an entry with Sony bmg's first country of release.\n\n3. Check if all these regions are indeed different: All three countries mentioned in steps one and two (Sony bmg from Indonesia and from Argentina) indeed have a 'different' version of the same label released - The third region that has this is Australia where \"sony bmg\" appears as part of an EP.\n\n4. Check if there is another Sony BMG entry present elsewhere in the table: Upon examining each row in this data, we can see two rows for the USA and two entries from Japan.\n\n\n5.

However, it doesn't explicitly rule out being the first either.\n- The table for \"United States UK\" on may 27 has two entries with the same date and label (\"epic records\"), both in formats of \"paid download\". This suggests that there might be competition around this date but does not confirm if one was indeed the \"first\".\n- For Finland, there is no information provided.\n- Australia on June 7 (2008) also has two entries with the same date and label (\"epic\") but both in formats of \"paid download\". Again, suggests competition rather than being a definitive first.\n- Indonesia's release dates do not contain format types that would make them immediately identifiable as potentially the first to market based on the information given.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the lack of explicit information about which paid download or cassette version was released first in the United States (on may 14, 2008), and considering there might be a release around this date for Japan but no clear indication it's confirmed first, we cannot accurately determine if this claim is true based solely on the table provided.
