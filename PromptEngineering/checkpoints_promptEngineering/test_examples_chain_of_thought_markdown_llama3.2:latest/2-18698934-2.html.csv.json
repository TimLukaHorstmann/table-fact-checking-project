Look at each row of the table to see where Siu Sai Wan appears:\n  - Row 1: The venue was Macau but does not mention Siu Sai Wan.\n  - Row 2: The venue is Hong Kong, and it is mentioned as \"siu sai wan sports ground\" which is correct.\n  - Row 3 and onwards do not need to be checked because the claim that Siu Sai Wan appears after being held in Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo has been fulfilled.\n\n3. Check if there is any information about the score of the game between Macau and Hong Kong in the row for Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground:\n   - The scored value (0) does not appear as a result of this match, so we need to look further.\n   - Looking at all rows again, the first row says that \"2010 hong kong - macau interport\" was played in Macau and \"siu sai wan sports ground , hong kong\" was played in Hong Kong.\n\n4.

To verify this, we need to check if there is any other row in the table where the \"scored\" column is greater than 0.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that for each competition:\n   - The 20 June 2010 game against Hong Kong had a score of 5-1, which means scored = 5.\n   - The 2 November 2010 friendly game against Hong Kong had a score of 0-4, but it also mentions \"friendly\" as the competition type. So we can't trust this one since 'scored' is zero for that specific row and there are no other values in the table to back up what the competition meant.\n   - The 26 January 2011 game against Hong Kong had a score of 1-0, so scored = 1.\n   - The 9 February 2011 friendly game against Hong Kong had a score of 0-4, but again we can\u2019t use this to back up the claim because 'scored' is zero for that specific row and there are no other values in the table to back up what the competition meant.\n   - The 3 June 2010 friendly game against Beijing had a score of 2-2, which means scored = 2.\n\n4.

To verify this claim, we need to check the number of friendly matches and non-friendly matches in the table.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that there are indeed 3 friendly matches (26 January 2011, Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground; 3 June 2010, Xianghe Sports Center; and 2 November 2010, Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground) and 2 non-friendly matches (20 June 2010, Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo, Macau, and 9 February 2011, Po Kong Village Park).\n4. Since the claim states that there should be only one 2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport match, we need to verify if this match is indeed friendly or not.\n5. According to the table, the 20 June 2010 match between Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo, Macau and 2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport has a score of 0 and no scored goals are mentioned for it , but the result is \"5-1\".

Since there's no date in the second match, we cannot determine whether it was held before any other match.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states \"none of the competition be friendly\", which can be interpreted as \"there are no competitions that are not friendly\".\n2. To determine if this is true, we need to examine the \"competition\" column in the table and check if there are any non-friendly matches.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that some rows have a value of 0 in the \"scored\" column, which may indicate a loss or no score, but it's not explicitly stated as \"friendly\" or \"non-friendly\".\n4. However, looking at the \"competition\" column itself:\n   - The Hong Kong - Macau Interport competition is listed.\n   - There are two friendly matches.\n   - One match against Beijing is listed but its name does not indicate if it was a friendly or competitive match.\n\nHowever, looking closer at the table we can find 3 other match names that may give us a clue about whether they're friendly:\n- \"2010 hong kong - macau interport\" is likely friendly.\n- The 2 matches against Beijing are referred to as \"friendly\" in their respective descriptions: \n   - Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground, Hong Kong\n   - Po Kung Village Park, Hong Kong\n   - Both these places have the word \"Recreation\" and \"Village\" respectively which may indicate that these were friendly matches.\n5. The only match without this description is \"Xi'Anhe Sports Center, Beijing\" so it's likely competitive.\n\nConsidering all the above information we can now determine if the claim is true or false.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Interpret the claim as 'none of the competition be friendly'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Examine the table to determine if there are any non-friendly matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Look at each match and check their description\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"There is one match against Beijing that we can't identify as friendly or not\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Since there are no other matches left to evaluate, it's likely the last one was competitive\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
