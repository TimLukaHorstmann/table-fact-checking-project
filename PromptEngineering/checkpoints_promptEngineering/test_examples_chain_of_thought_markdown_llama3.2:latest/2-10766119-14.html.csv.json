Look up each row in the table to find the corresponding crowd values:\n   - north melbourne: 11000\n   - footscray: 14000\n   - collingwood: 30000\n   - carlton: 10000\n   - melbourne: 13562\n   - south melbourne: 16000\n3. Find the row with the largest crowd value:\n   - north melbourne: 11000 (no)\n   - footscray: 14000 (yes, largest so far)\n   - collingwood: 30000 (larger than current largest)\n   - carlton: 10000 (no)\n   - melbourne: 13562 (smaller than current largest)\n   - south melbourne: 16000 (larger than current largest)\n\n4. The row with the largest crowd value is collingwood, so now we must verify if Victoria Park has this value.\n5. Look up the \"venue\" and corresponding crowd values for Collingwood:\n   - Collingwood's venue is indeed \"victoria park\".\n6. Verify that 30000 is listed in the row corresponding to Collingwood: Yes.\n\n7.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim about St Kilda having the highest score as an away team in the 1928 VFL season is true, we need to find out their highest away team score.\n\n2. From the table, we can see that there are four teams: north melbourne, footscray, collingwood, and carlton.\n\n3. We should look at each row where St Kilda played as an away team (i.e., rows 3, 4, and 6).\n\n4. For St Kilda's first game against Collingwood on July 28th, 1928, their away team score was 10.13 (73). \n\n5. In the second match of the season against Carlton on the same day, their away team score was 11.13 (79).\n\n6. Lastly, we should check St Kilda's last game against Essendon, also played on July 28th, 1928. Here, their away team score was 18.11 (119).\n\n7. We need to find the highest score among these three instances and compare it with other teams' scores.\n\n8. Looking at scores of all home teams and away teams that day:\n   - North melbourne scored 21.11 (137) as an away team.\n   - Footscray scored 8.9 (57).\n   - Collingwood scored 11.15 (81).\n   - Carlton scored 22.17 (149).\n   - Fitzroy scored 18.18 (126).\n   - Essendon scored 18.11 (119).\n\n9. Among these, North melbourne and Carlton have the highest away team scores with 137 and 149 respectively.\n\n10. Since St Kilda's score of 119 is lower than both 137 and 149, we can conclude that St Kilda does not have the highest away team score for the season.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Extract the scores for Essendon as an away team and Hawthorn as a home team from the table.\n   - Essendon's score: 18.11 (119)\n   - Hawthorn's score: 11.13 (79)\n\n2. Calculate the difference between these two scores to see if it matches or exceeds 6.35 points.\n\n   The formula for calculating the difference is:\n   Difference = Away Team Score - Home Team Score\n   \n   Applying this formula:\n   \n   Difference = 119 - 79\n            = 40\n\n3. Compare this calculated difference with 6.35 points to determine if it's true that Essendon have a higher score as an away team than Hawthorn by 6.35 point.\n\nSince the calculated difference is 40, which is not equal to 6.35, the claim \"Essendon have a higher score as an away team than hawthorn by 6.35 point\" cannot be true.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}",
