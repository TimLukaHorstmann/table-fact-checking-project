    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Kevin Martin's scores**: \n   First, we need to look at each row of the table where Kevin Martin played as a player, since he is mentioned in all rows for that column.\n\n2. **List all game data with relevant columns**:\n   The table has several variables, but only 'score' and 'high points' are relevant here.\n   All scores were mentioned in the table: 33 (april 1), 35 (april 3), 30 (april 5), 21 (april 6), 16 (april 9).\n\n3. **Evaluate each score**:\n   Now we evaluate if these scores are singular, since that is what the claim states.\n   In April 8 game (april 1) Kevin Martin scored 33 points in singular.\n   In April 2 game (april 3), he had two players with a high of 12. So his high was not singular.\n   In April 4 game (april 5), he also shared the high with Chuck Hayes, but not just one other player. His score is still singular by this measure because no one else on the same line scored higher.\n   In April 7 game (april 6) his points came in a share of ten between another two players, making it not singular.\n   In April 8 game (april 9), three other people on the row shared Kevin Martin's high point. So this is not an instance of his score being singular.\n\n4. **Conclusion based on data**:\n   Since we only need a single game where \"kevin martin\" does NOT share his highest points with another player, and since all rows except April 9 have him as the one to hold that single high mark, it can be stated that in no instance of all those games did he score singularly (by comparison with others).\n\n5. **Convert step-by-step reasoning into JSON**:\n   Here is our chain of thought, a value for \"answer\", and some relevant data about cells from the table:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"statement\": \"We need to identify Kevin Martin's scores\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"statement\": \"List all game data with relevant columns\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"statement\": \"Evaluate each score for singular points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"statement\": \"Conclusion based on data\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"high points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"high points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"high points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"high points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
