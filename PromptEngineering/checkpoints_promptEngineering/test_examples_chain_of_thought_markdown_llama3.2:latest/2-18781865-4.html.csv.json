The table shows information about different nations, their ranking (gold, silver, bronze, and total), and other relevant details.\n\n2. **Identify the rank**: The claim mentions \"set of nation that share the same rank\". So we need to find out if there are any ranks with only one country associated with it.\n\n3. **Look for duplicate rankings**: We need to check each ranking (gold, silver, bronze) across all rows in the table and see if any row shares the same rank but has a different nation associated with that rank.\n\n4.  Analyze gold: Check the 'Gold' column. Since only one country (can) has Gold in the first row and no other country share this ranking, we can eliminate one set of nations with the same rank.\n \n5.  Analyze Silver: Now check the 'Silver' column. We find that 'Australia (aus)' and 'Netherlands (ned)' both have silver but different ranks for them; they are tied as the second rank (row #2). This is our first pair of nations sharing a rank.\n\n6.  Analyze Bronze: Look at the bronze column now. Since only Japan has Bronze in row #4 but no other country share this ranking, we can eliminate another set of nations with the same rank.\n \n7. **Conclusion**: There are two sets of nations sharing the same rank - they both have silver and bronze rankings.

First, I will review the table to understand what information is provided.\n   - The table contains a list of nations ranked by their performance in an event or competition, with columns for gold, silver, bronze medals, and the total number of medals won.\n\n2. Next, I will analyze the claim that \"there be 4 nation that do not receive a gold medal.\"\n   - This means we need to check how many rows (nations) have a value of 0 in the column marked as 'gold' since that would indicate they did not win any gold medals.\n\n3. Then, I will examine each row of the table for values in the 'gold' column.\n   - Looking at the data:\n     - Canada (can) won 2 gold medals and has no other values to consider.\n     - Australia (aus), Netherlands (ned), United States (usa), Japan (jpn) all have 0 values in the gold medal column, which suggests they did not win any gold medals.\n\n4. Now, I will compare the number of nations with a value of 0 in the 'gold' column to the claim.\n   - There are four nations (aus, ned, usa, jpn) without a gold medal, but the statement says \"there be 4 nation\", which is a singular noun and should be \"there are\" according to standard English grammar rules. Nonetheless, this difference of grammatical form does not impact our counting.\n\n5. Finally, I will draw a conclusion based on my observations.\n   - The four nations listed do indeed have zero gold medals, confirming the claim that there are indeed 4 nations without receiving any gold medal wins.\n\n\n### Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
