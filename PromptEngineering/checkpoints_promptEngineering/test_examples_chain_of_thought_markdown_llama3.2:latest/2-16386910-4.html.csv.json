First, we need to understand what each column in the table represents:\n   - `date`: The date of the game\n   - `visitor` or `home`: The team that played away (visitor) or at home\n   - `score`: The score of the game\n   - `record`: The record of the San Antonio Spurs before this game\n\n2. We need to identify the relevant games for each team mentioned in the claim:\n   - For the San Antonio Spurs, we can see that they played against the Los Angeles Lakers on December 3, 1976 and also the Phoenix Suns (on December 5, 1976). \n\n3. Next, we should verify if these two teams did play before the San Antonio Spurs' game against the Phoenix Suns:\n   - From the table, we can see that the San Antonio Spurs played the Los Angeles Lakers on December 3, 1976\n   - The San Antonio Spurs also played the Phoenix Suns on December 5, 1976\n\n4. Now we need to verify if the games were in a valid order:\n   - The game against the Phoenix Suns happened after the game against the Los Angeles Lakers, which is consistent with our claim.\n\nHere's the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant teams\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify if these two teams played before San Antonio Spurs' Phoenix Suns game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the order of the games\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To verify this claim, we need to compare the scores for both dates in the table.\n3. Looking at the table, we can find the relevant cells for both dates:\n\t* December 11, 1976: `row_index` = 12, `column_name` = \"score\" (value is `106 - 121`)\n\t* December 14, 1976: `row_index` = 15, `column_name` = \"score\" (value is `98 - 111`)\n4. Now we can compare the scores for both dates:\n\t* San Antonio Spurs' score on December 11, 1976: `106 - 121`\n\t* San Antonio Spurs' score on December 14, 1976: `98 - 111`\n5.

We need to find this game in the table.\n\n    - Relevant cell: | date               | visitor               | score     | home                  | record   |\n    |:-------------------|:----------------------|:----------|:----------------------|:---------|\n    | december 26 , 1976 | san antonio spurs     | 110 - 105 | kansas city kings     | 17 - 16  |\n\n    The game between San Antonio Spurs and Kansas City Kings is on December 26, 1976.\n\n2. **Identify the home record of San Antonio Spurs before facing Cleveland Cavaliers**: According to the table, we need to find the record of San Antonio Spurs before facing Cleveland Cavaliers. Since there's no clear \"home\" column for the opponent, we can infer the record from the previous games played by San Antonio Spurs.\n\n    - Relevant cell: | date               | visitor               | score     | home                  | record   |\n    |:-------------------|:----------------------|:----------|:----------------------|:---------|\n    | december 21 , 1976 | golden state warriors | 123 - 120 | san antonio spurs     | 15 - 16  |\n    | december 23 , 1976 | washington bullets    | 116 - 118 | san antonio spurs     | 16 - 16  |\n\n    San Antonio Spurs had a record of 15-16 before facing Cleveland Cavaliers, as shown in the previous two games.\n\n3. **Identify the game against Cleveland Cavaliers**: We need to find the game between San Antonio Spurs and Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n    - Relevant cell: | date               | visitor               | score     | home                  | record   |\n    |:-------------------|:----------------------|:----------|:----------------------|:---------|\n    | december 17 , 1976 | san antonio spurs     | 101 - 103 | chicago bulls         | 14 - 15  |\n    | december 19 , 1976 | san antonio spurs     | 105 - 106 | cleveland cavaliers   | 14 - 16  |\n\n    The game between San Antonio Spurs and Cleveland Cavaliers is on December 17, 1976.\n\n4. **Check if the home record of San Antonio Spurs against Kansas City Kings matches with the away record against Cleveland Cavaliers**: Since the claim mentions playing against both teams in different capacities (home vs. away), we need to check if the home record of San Antonio Spurs against Kansas City Kings is indeed the same as their away record against Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n    - Relevant cell: | date               | visitor               | score     | home                  | record   |\n    |:-------------------|:----------------------|:----------|:----------------------|:---------|\n    | december 26 , 1976 | san antonio spurs     | 110 - 105 | kansas city kings     | 17 - 16  |\n\n    The home record of San Antonio Spurs against Kansas City Kings is 17-16, which matches with the away record against Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the steps 3 and 4 show a match in records between the two games, we can conclude that the claim \"the san antonio spur play against the kansas city king before play against the cleveland cavalier\" is TRUE.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the game against Kansas City Kings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the home record of San Antonio Spurs before facing Cleveland Cavaliers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the game against Cleveland Cavaliers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the home record of San Antonio Spurs against Kansas City Kings matches with the away record against Cleveland Cavaliers\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that the San Antonio Spurs do not score less than 100 points during any game before December 19, 1976.\n\n2. **Locate relevant data**:\n   - To verify this claim, we need to check each row in the table up until and including December 19, 1976.\n   - We are particularly interested in rows where the \"score\" column shows a score less than 100.\n\n3. **Check scores for games before December 19, 1976**:\n   - For the dates leading up to December 19 (December 2, 5, 8, 10, and 11), we need to verify if any of these game results show scores below 100 points.\n   - We then continue checking all subsequent games until December 19.\n\n4. **Verify claim based on findings**:\n   - If no row before or including December 19 shows a score less than 100 for the San Antonio Spurs, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, if at least one such score exists before December 19, then the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify specific relevant cells**: For our purpose, we are interested in rows that show:\n   ```\n{\n  \"row_index\": <the row number of each game>,\n  \"column_name\": \"score\"\n}\n```\n   These would include rows where `score` is less than 100 and `date` falls before or on December 19.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Step-by-step reasoning process concludes that** the San Antonio Spurs indeed do not score less than 100 points in any game before December 19, 1976, as no such row exists within our specified timeframe.\n- Therefore, based on this analysis, the answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"No rows showing scores <100 found for dates prior to December 19, 1976\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
