Florida plays at home (`\"home\"` = `\"ny islanders\"`) on march 2.\n2. Florida plays at home (`\"home\"` = `\"boston\"`) on march 4.\n3. Florida does not play at home (`\"home\"` = `\"pittsburgh\"`) on march 6.\n4. Florida plays at home (`\"home\"` = `\"florida\"`) on march 8.\n5.

We will assume they scored the same amount as Florida since no scores are given for that date.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Florida and Tampa Bay's score on March 22\n\nBased on step 2, both teams had a score of `17012`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if Florida won by 2 points against Tampa Bay on March 22.\n\nSince we don't have exact scores from the table for March 22, but we know that there are no scores given in the row related to march 22.

Since \"home\" only appears in three rows, we can quickly scan through them.\n\n2. **Verify attendance data for each row where \"home\" contains \"tampa bay\"**: We will check if the attendance values match the one given in the claim (16110) and also verify that it's a home game. We need to make sure that Tampa Bay played at home on exactly 9 occasions.\n\n3. **Compare attendance data with the information given in the claim**: If the attendance data matches the one provided for each instance where Tampa Bay played at home, then we can confirm whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n\n4. **Determine if the season was indeed 2007-2008 based on other relevant data from table (e.g., date)**: To verify that the entire season took place in 2007 - 2008, check for any other dates that fall within this timeframe and relate to Tampa Bay's games.\n\n5. **Conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE**: With all steps completed, we will be able to definitively say if the claim was accurate or not.\n\nHere's our step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n- First, let's scan through each row of \"home\" to see which ones contain \"tampa bay\":\n  * March 25: Florida - Tampa Bay\n  * March 22: Carolina - Florida\n  * March 29: Washington - Florida\n\n**Step 3: Verification**\n\nFor the instance where Tampa Bay played against Florida on March 25:\n\n- Attendance at that match was 16110.\n\nThis matches with claim. Let's continue to check other rows to see if there were indeed 8 more home games.\n\nFor each row of \"home\" that contains \"tampa bay\", verify attendance:\n\n*   March 6: Pittsburgh - Florida (Attendance: 17012) - Doesn't match\n*   March 16: Atlanta - Florida (Attendance: 15704) - Doesn't match\n*   March 20: Carolina - Florida (Attendance: 18546) - Doesn't match\n*   March 27: Atlanta - Florida (Attendance: 17301) - Doesn't match\n\nThis shows we need to verify if the attendance matches for Tampa Bay playing at home again in another row. \n\nAfter checking, no other \"tampa bay\" row exists where attendance was 16110.
