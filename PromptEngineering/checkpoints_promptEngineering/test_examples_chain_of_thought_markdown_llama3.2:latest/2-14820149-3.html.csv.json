The information regarding wins doesn't directly match what is stated.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe claim does state \"for the 500cc class with 61 points\", which is actually incorrect according to the provided data for the year 1992 where it states 61 and not in 1990 or 1991.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the claim: \"there be 8 point for the 1991 250cc class , but only 4 point for the 1986cc class\"\n\n2. To verify the claim, we need to check if there is indeed an entry in the table with a value of 8 points for the 1991 250cc class and a value of 4 points for the 1986 500cc class.\n\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that the row index for the 1991 250cc class is 9 (since it starts from 0) and the column for \"points\" has a value of 121, not 8.\n\n4. However, let's also check if there is an entry in the table with a value of 8 points for the 1986 500cc class. Looking at the row index for the 1986 500cc class, which is 7 (since it starts from 0), we can see that the column for \"points\" has a value of 4.\n\n5. Since there is no entry in the table with an 8-point value for the 1991 250cc class and the 1986 500cc class actually has 4 points not 8, it seems that claim does seem to be true\n\nHowever our claim seems incorrect at this point as we verified one of the parts of our claim was not present in the table but we also did verify that the other part (the 4 point value) is there and that both of the classes were classified under \"500cc\" and not \"250cc\".\n\n6. Let's review our findings so far. We know our initial assessment on the first part was incorrect, because the second part of our claim was actually true\n\n7. Our final answer will therefore be False as we verified that there is indeed 8 points in one class but it wasn't a 250cc and only 4 points in another class that also was 500cc.\n\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
