However it seems that 'Rob Howells' did won four out of five categories for the 2008 Laurence Olivier Award.\n\n3. **Analyze the information**: Since \"The Lion King\" is a musical based on the Disney franchise of \"The Lion King\", and there is no evidence in this table to suggest that the show was called \"Lord of Ring\". Thus, we can conclude that the claim is false because it refers to a different title.\n\n4. **Consider alternative possibilities**: There are no other claims in the problem statement that refer to the same musical being nominated for 5 awards.\n\n5. **Reach a conclusion based on evidence**: Given the information in the table and the specific wording of the claim, we can confidently conclude that the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"The claim states that the Lord of Ring musical was nominated for 5 Laurence Olivier Awards in 2008, in 5 different categories.\",\n      \"finding\": \"There's no direct reference to 'Lord of Ring' but rather there is a mention of another title.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"However it seems that Rob Howells did won four out of five categories for the 2008 Laurence Olivier Award.\",\n      \"finding\": \"The table does show some technical categories being won by someone named 'Rob Howell'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
