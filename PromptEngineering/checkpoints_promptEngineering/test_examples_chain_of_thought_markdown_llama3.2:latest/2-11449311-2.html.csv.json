We will focus on rows that contain the word \"Buccaneers\", as they are the team in question.\n\n3. Looking at column \"result\", we see that there is no row where the Buccaneers win any games. This means we can start looking for losses to verify the claim.\n\n4. In column \"record\", we will check if there are two wins and fourteen losses, which would confirm the Buccaneers' 2-14 record for their 1985 season.\n\n5. The table also has a row with \"Buccaneers\" in column \"opponent\". This could be an indication that another team is playing against the Buccaneers in this game.\n\n6. After looking at each cell in rows 1 through 16, we can confirm if indeed two of these losses are to teams like the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots listed on row 8 which would fit with a record of 2-14.",

The first step is to look at the table and identify the column that contains the point scores for each game, which is the \"result\" column.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the rows in the table where a team scored 60 points or more against the Buccaneers (which are not present) and also find rows where a different team scored 60 points or more against the Buccaneers. Since no team scored 60+ points against the buccaneers, this step can be skipped.\n\n3. We then need to look at all other columns in the table that would have information relevant to determining if any of the teams scored 60 points or more for them and find out their highest scoring games as well. We only care about \"opponent\" since there is no team that played the buccaneer in which a team scored 60+ against the buccaneers. \n\n4. Since we know now that we do not have to search for scores of any teams playing against each other, but just searching what was the highest possible score any team got when they were playing against another team (not the buccaneer), we can then find the game with the most points scored by a single player. In this case it is the 7th week row where miami dolphins played against the buccaneers with an outcome of l 41 - 38.\n\n5. After that, we simply need to determine whether the value in the \"result\" column for this row (the one that was scored by the Dolphins) exceeds 60 points or not.
