First, let's analyze the claim: \"in the cup , there be just 2 tie on january 24 : wolverhampton bradford city , and sunderland v bolton\".\n   - We need to check if there are only two ties scheduled for January 24th.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that January 24th has several matches.\n   - The columns of interest are \"date\", \"home team\", \"score\", and \"away team\".\n\n3. Let's look at each row related to January 24th:\n   - Row 11: \"bradford city           | 0 - 0   | wolverhampton wanderers | 24 january 1931\" - This is a tie with no result.\n   - Row 15: \"southport               | 2 - 1   | blackpool               | 24 january 1931\" - This is not a tie, it's another match.\n   - Row 16: \"leeds united            | 4 - 1   | newcastle united        | 24 january 1931\" - This is not a tie, it's another match.\n\n4. Now let's check the actual number of ties:\n   - There are more than two matches scheduled for January 24th, which includes rows 11 and 16.\n   \n5. Since there are actually more than two ties on January 24th (wolverhampton bradford city and sunderland v bolton), our claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze the claim, looking at relevant cells in the table to check if there are only two ties scheduled for January 24th. There are more than two matches on that date, including rows 11 and 16.

Check the scores: In this row, the score for \"home team\" (Everton) is not explicitly given, but since Everton scored 6 goals, it can be inferred that the score is 6-0.\n5. Check if the biggest margin of victory came in this match: The margin of victory is the difference between the home team's score and away team's score.

We know that Everton defeated Tottenham Hotspur 6 - 0. So we need to find this row in the table. The relevant rows are:\n\n    * Crystal Palace vs Everton on 24 January 1931 (score: 0-6)\n    * No other match has a score of 6-0.\n\n3. Since there is only one row with a score of 6-0, it means that this is the only instance where Everton defeats Tottenham Hotspur with a margin of victory greater than 5 goals.\n\n4. Now, let's look at all the rows in the table to see if any other team has defeated an opponent with a larger margin of victory. We can do this by checking all possible scores (e.g., 6-0, 7-0, etc.).\n\n    * We don't have enough information to confirm that any other match has a score greater than 6-0.\n    \n5. Since we have confirmed that there is only one instance of Everton defeating Tottenham Hotspur with a margin of victory greater than 5 goals and no other team defeated an opponent with a larger margin, it means that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find row where Everton defeats Tottenham Hotspur\",\n      \"description\": \"We know that Everton defeated Tottenham Hotspur with the largest margin of victory.

To verify this, we need to examine the score columns of each game and check if there are instances where a team's score is more than 2.\n3. Looking at each game, we can see that several teams have scored more than 2 goals in a single match:\n   - Blackburn Rovers (5 goals against Bristol Rovers)\n   - Sheffield United (4 goals against Notts County)\n   - Wolverhampton Wanderers (4 goals against Bradford City)\n   - Sunderland (3 goals against Bolton Wanderers, and 3 goals against Bradford City in the replay)\n   - Chelsea (2 goals against Arsenal)\n   - Leeds United (4 goals against Newcastle United)\n   - Brentford did not score more than two.\n   - Bolton wanderer did not scored more than 2 in their replay either\n4. However, we must also consider that for this claim to be true, the only five games where a team scores more than two should be within \"only 5 game do\" or otherwise it would violate the rule stated on the claim.\n5.
