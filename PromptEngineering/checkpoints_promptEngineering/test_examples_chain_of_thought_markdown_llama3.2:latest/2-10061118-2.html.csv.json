    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find out if there are any occurrences of Philippe Etancelin winning a race on April 6th.\n   We refer to the table cell \"name: tunis grand prix\", \"date: 29 march\" and \"report: achille varzi\". \n   Then we look at the cell \"name: circuit d'esterel plage\", \"date: 6 april\" and \"report: philippe \u00e9tancelin\". \n   This means that Philippe Etancelin won a race on April 6th.\n\n2. Now, let's find out if there are any other occurrences of Philippe Etancelin winning a race during the 1931 season.\n   Looking at the cell \"name: monticello grand prix\", we don't have enough information to confirm it. So we refer to cell \"name: picardy grand prix\". \n   Then we look at the cell \"name: circuit du vaucluse\", \"date: 5 july\" and \"report: fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric toselli\".\n   We also look at cell \"name: dieppe grand prix\", \"date: 26 july\" and \"report: philippe \u00e9tancelin\". \n   So we confirm another win by Philippe Etancelin on July 26th.\n\n3. Now, let's find out if there are any other occurrences of Philippe Etancelin winning a race during the 1931 season.\n   We refer to cell \"name: grand prix de la marne\", \"date: 5 july\" and \"report: marcel lehoux\". \n   Then we look at the cell \"name: circuit du vaucluse\", \"date: 5 july\" and \"report: fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric toselli\".\n   We also refer to cell \"name: german grand prix\", \"date: 19 july\" and \"report: rudolf caracciola\". \n   Then we look at the cell \"name: circuit du dauphin\u00e9\", \"date: 2 august\" and \"report: philippe \u00e9tancelin\". \n   So we confirm another win by Philippe Etancelin on August 2nd.\n\n4. Now, let's find out if there are any other occurrences of Philippe Etancelin winning a race during the 1931 season.\n   We refer to cell \"name: grand prix du comminges\", \"date: 16 august\" and \"report: philippe \u00e9tancelin\". \n   Then we look at the cell \"name: coppa acerbo\", \"date: 16 august\" and \"report: giuseppe campari\".\n   So we don't have enough information to confirm another win by Philippe Etancelin on August 16th.\n\n5. Now, let's find out if there are any other occurrences of Philippe Etancelin winning a race during the 1931 season.\n   Looking at cell \"name: monza grand prix\", we refer to cell \"name: la baule grand prix\", \"date: 13 september\" and \"report: william grover - williams\". \n   Then we look at the cell \"name: masaryk grand prix\", \"date: 27 september\" and \"report: louis chiron\".\n   We also refer to cell \"name: brignoles grand prix\", \"date: 27 september\" and \"report: ren\u00e9 dreyfus\". \n   Then we look at the cell \"name: mountain championship\", \"date: 17 october\" and \"report: henry birkin\".\n\n6. Now, let's find out if there are any other occurrences of Philippe Etancelin winning a race during the 1931 season.\n   We don't have enough information to confirm another win by Philippe Etancelin on October 17th.\n\n7. Having checked all relevant cells in the table for April 6th and July 26th and August 2nd, we can conclude that:\n   The claim \"Philippe Etancelin win race on 4 occasion during the 1931 grand prix season\" is FALSE.\n   We list our reasoning steps here: \n   - Philippe Etancelin won a race on April 6th.\n   - Philippe Etancelin also won a race on July 26th.\n   - Philippe Etancelin also won a race on August 2nd.\n   - There are not enough information to confirm another win by Philippe Etancelin during the season.\n\nHere is our final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": {\n    \"value\": false,\n    \"description\": \"\"\n  }\n}",
