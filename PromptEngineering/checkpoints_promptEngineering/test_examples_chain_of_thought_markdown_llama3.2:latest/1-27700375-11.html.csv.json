    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to identify the most highly attended game from the table.\n   - To do this, we look at the column for \"location attendance\", which contains the attendance numbers for each game.\n   - The highest attendance number will indicate the most highly attended game.\n\n2. Next, we find out where in the season this most highly attended game took place.\n   - We need to examine each row of the table and see if there is a match between the \"location\" (where) the game was played and \"prudential center\".\n\n3. If the claim states that the most highly attended game against Miami at the prudential center, we must then verify this information.\n   - First, we confirm which games were against Miami, by checking if the team column matches 'miami'. Then we check where these games took place and their respective attendance numbers.\n\n4. Once we have confirmed that a game was both highly attended and played at the prudential center against Miami, we must verify whether this is indeed the most highly attended of all such games.\n   - We will need to compare the attendance number of this specific game with other games which were also played in the prudential center but against different teams.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued\n\n5. Having verified that a game was both highly attended and played at the prudential center, we then check if it was against Miami.\n   - To do this, we look for rows where the team column is 'miami' and also see that the location of those games were 'prudential center'.\n\n6. After confirming that our target game meets both conditions (high attendance, played at prudential center, and was a game against miami), we can verify if it's indeed the most highly attended by comparing its attendance number with other highly attended games against different teams.\n\n7. If after comparison we find that this game holds the record for the highest attendance against Miami at the Prudential Center, then our claim is true.\n   - We need to compare the attendance of this specific game to all other games in the table where the team played against miami and the location was prudential center.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued\n\n8. Finally, we verify if any other highly attended games were played at the Prudential Center but against different teams.\n   - We must check that no attendance number is higher than our specific game to make sure it indeed holds the record for the most highly attended game played in the prudential center.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued\n\n9. If after checking all relevant games, we confirm there are no other games with a higher attendance, then we can confidently conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n   - This means our game of interest (miami vs prudential center) indeed had the highest attendance number in its respective group.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued\n\n10.

We can do this by looking for a cell with a \"w\" (win) value in the \"record\" column.\n\n2. **Identify rows where Nets won**: If a win was found, identify the row(s) where the Brooklyn Nets played and won. In these cases, the game date should be listed in the table as April 5th for game #77. \n\n3. **Check if any other team won at Air Canada Centre**: Next, we need to check if any other team won a game at the Air Canada Centre on the same day (April 10) as the Brooklyn Nets' win.\n\n4. **Find winning games of the Nets at Air Canada Centre**: We must look for game #80 and verify that it was indeed a game where the Brooklyn Nets played and won.\n\n5. **Check if any other team also won against the nets on April 10th at the air canada centre**:\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n- Determine whether all conditions are met in order to confirm or deny the validity of the claim.\n7.

Row 79 shows New York vs Prudential Center which has different team names than Minnesota.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine if the claim is true or false based on steps 1-2\nConsidering that we found no evidence that Minnesota played against another team at the prudential center, and since row 77's values for \"team\" and \"location\" match what we're looking for in our claim, it can be concluded that this claim should hold.\n\n#### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 77,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 77,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
