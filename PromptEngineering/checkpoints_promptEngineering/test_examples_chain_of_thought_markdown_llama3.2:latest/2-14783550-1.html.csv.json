Looking at row 1 in the table, we see that China has won 43 gold medals for all sports combined, but we need to find out how many gold medals China has specifically won for Wushu.\n2. Since there is no specific information about the country \"china\" or any other nation for \"Wushu\", we will assume the provided information applies to a country named \"chn\".\n3. Looking at row 1 in the table, we see that China (chn) has won 43 gold medals and 7 silver medals.\n4. Next, let's find out how many gold medals Iran has specifically won for Wushu. As there is no mention of \"Wushu\" for the country \"iran\", we will assume the provided information applies to a country named \"iri\".\n5. Looking at row 2 in the table, we see that Iran (iri) has won 4 gold medals and 3 silver medals.\n6.

Since the claim specifically mentions wushu, which is not explicitly listed in the table, we can assume it refers to the standard Olympic sport categories (e.g., archery, badminton, etc.), as some Asian Games events are related to sports like martial arts. Therefore, we will focus on finding information about the gold medal count for sports or martial art disciplines where Singapore and Mongolia may have participated.\n4. To check Singapore's performance, let's look at its total number of medals and see if there is any mention of a specific sport where it won a gold medal. \n   - According to the table, Singapore has won 5 medals in total, but no specific information about wushu or martial arts disciplines.\n5.
