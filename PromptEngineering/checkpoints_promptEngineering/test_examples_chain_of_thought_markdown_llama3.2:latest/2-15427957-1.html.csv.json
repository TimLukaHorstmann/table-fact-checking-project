The table shows multiple instances of being in Tier 1 and not just one instance.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there are records of them being in Tier 1 prior to 1999, the statement that \"the first time they be in tier 1 be in 1999\" is false.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Multiple instances of a team being in tier 1 before 1999 show that this claim is false.

Looking at the table, we can see that there are two seasons where this information is mentioned: 2003-04 and 2004-05. However, the claim states \"before 2005\", so we need to look at both of these seasons as well as the one before it (2002-03).\n3. For each season, we check if the relevant cell has a value of \"champion\" or any other indication that they were FIBA Europe Cup Champions.\n4. In the 2002-03 season, there is no information about being in the FIBA Europe Cup Champion European competition.\n5. In the 2003-04 season, the club was indeed the FIBA Europe Cup Champion.\n6. In the 2004-05 season, the club did not win the championship.\n7. Since the claim states \"before 2005\", we can conclude that the relevant seasons for this claim are 1998 and 2003.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the 1997-98 season. According to the table, they played in the FIBA Europe Cup, but it does not indicate that they were champions.\n3. In the 1999-00 season, they quarterfinalist, which means they did not win the championship.\n\n2. Based on these findings, we can conclude that only one team won the FIBA Europe Cup Championship before 2005 (in 2003) and played in the European competition in previous seasons.\n\n3.

We will refer to these as \"relegation instances\".\n\n2. Next, we need to find out when the team was promoted in the postseason for the first time.\n\n    In the table, there is a promotion playoffs entry in the 1998 - 99 season. This means that the team was promoted in the postseason before being relegated again. We will refer to this as \"first promotion instance\".\n\n3. Since we need to determine when the team was first relegated and then first promoted in the postseason, let's compare our instances:\n\n    - The earliest relegation instance is 2000 - 01.\n    - The first promotion instance in the postseason is 1998 - 99.\n\n4. Now, we can evaluate the claim: \"the first time they be relegate in the postseason be before the first time they be promote in the postseason\". \n\n    Based on our instances:\n        - First relegation: 2000 - 01\n        - First promotion in postseason: 1998 - 99\n\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. The claim states \"they be in the fiba europe cup champion europ[ean competition before 2005\". This means we need to check if the team was the FIBA Europe Cup champion before 2005.\n\n2. To verify this, we can look at the relevant table cell that contains the information about European competitions. The column for \"European competitions\" shows \"-\", \"played korac cup\", and \"FIBA europe cup champion\" in different rows. \n\n3. We can see that the team was indeed the FIBA Europe Cup champion during the 2003-04 season.\n\n4. Now, we need to check if this championship occurred before 2005. Since the 2003-04 season ended in June 2004 and the 2004-05 season started in July 2004, it is clear that the team was indeed a champion before 2005.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Check if the team was the FIBA Europe Cup champion\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Look at the relevant table cell for European competitions\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Verify that the championship occurred in 2003-04 season\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Confirm that this championship happened before 2005\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"European competitions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"European competitions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the first time the team was promoted in the postseason: According to the table, this happened in the 2004-05 season (cell [Postseason] in row 6).\n2. Identify the first time the team was relegated in the postseason: According to the table, this happened in the 2010-11 season (cell [Postseason] in row 13).\n3. Compare the two dates: The 2004-05 season is before the 2010-11 season.\n4. Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison: Since the first time they were promoted in the postseason was after the first time they were relegated, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"}\n  ]\n}",
