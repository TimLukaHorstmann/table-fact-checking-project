This means we need to count how many gymnasts have an 'a score' of exactly 6.600.\n\n2. Looking at the table, the column for 'position' helps us identify which row corresponds to each gymnast's performance.\n\n3. We start by examining each row in the table to see if any of them contain a value of 6.600 in the 'a score' column.\n\n4. For the first row, diego hyp\u00f3lito ( bra ) has an 'a score' of 6.6, which matches our target value.\n\n5. We repeat this process for each gymnast's entry in the table.\n\n6. After examining all rows:\n   - The only gymnast whose 'a score' is exactly 6.600 is diego hyp\u00f3lito ( bra ) at position 1st.\n\n7.

Since diego hyp\u00f3lito ( bra ) at position 1st has an 'a score' of 6.600, we must determine if there are any other gymnasts also meeting this criteria or count just this single case to assess the truth value of the claim.\n\n10. After examining all rows:\n    - Only diego hyp\u00f3lito ( bra ) meets the condition of having an 'a score' of exactly 6.600.\n\n11.
