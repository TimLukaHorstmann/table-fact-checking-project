Next, we need to identify the row where Lamarcs Aldridge score is most in the table.\n4. By looking at the table, we can find that \n    - The highest point scored by Lamarcs Aldridge is 34 points\n    - Lamarcs Aldridge tie for high point with Andre Miller once (in game #38)\n    - And also Lamarcs Aldridge tied for high point with Juwan Howards twice and lamarcus aldridges also score the same amount of points as rudy fernandez in one case.\n5. Now, we need to check if Portland win all 3 games where Lamarcs lead or tie highest scoring players\n6. We can see that \n    - In game #35, Portland won with a final score of w 105 - 89 (ot)  \n    - In game #38, Portland won with a final score of w 107 - 98 (ot)\n    - However, we also find in the table that in game #46, Portland lost to New Orleans\n7. Since one case didn't result in a win for portland hence \n   \"lamarcus aldridge lead or tie for most points 3 time and portland win all 3 of those games\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 38,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 38,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 46,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
