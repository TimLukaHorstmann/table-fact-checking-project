    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to determine how many times the home team scores zero (0-0) in total.\n2. We can see from the table that there are two games where the score is 0-0: game 5 and its replay.\n3. However, since this is a \"replay\" of the same match as the original one listed in the table, we should only consider the first occurrence (game 5) for our count.\n\n2. Now, let's find out how many times the home team scores zero (0-0). \n   From the given data we see the home team only scored zero 1 time\n\n3. The claim says \"out of all game\". Hence we need to consider each and every match separately.\n   So, if a team played in both replay and regular season then for that particular day, home team will have two chances to score.\n\n4. Given data states, \n   - For game 5 (fulham vs west ham), the home team fulham plays with an attendance of 14705 and wins with a score of 0-0.\n   - The same is true for the replay match between Fulham and West Ham where it had an attendance of 27934 and Fulham won with a score of 0-3. Thus, even though the final score was 3-0 in favor of West Ham, we still count this as one zero win because we know there's no other team that beats fulham on that day.\n\n5. Therefore, out of all possible games, home team only scores zero twice i.e., for fulham vs west ham and replay between Fulham and West Ham.\n\n\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Determine how many times the home team scores zero (0-0) in total.\",\n      \"data\": \"2 games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Find out how many times the home team scores zero (0-0).\",\n      \"data\": \"1 game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Check if home team fulham plays in both replay and regular season.\",\n      \"data\": \"Yes, for match 5 and its replay.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Count the number of zero wins by home team (fulham vs west ham) and replay between Fulham and West Ham.\",\n      \"data\": \"2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to find the attendance for each game (tie no 7).\n   - The relevant cell for tie no 7 is | tie no   | home team         | score   | away team         |   attendance |\n   - The row with tie no 7 is | 7        | millwall          | 1 - 0   | burnley           |        10420 |\n\n2. Now, we need to compare the attendance of this game (10420) to all other games.\n   - We'll look at each relevant cell in the table:\n     ```markdown\n| tie no   | home team         | score   | away team         |   attendance |\n|:---------|:------------------|:--------|:------------------|-------------:|\n| 1        | liverpool         | 1 - 1   | portsmouth        |        34669 |\n| replay   | portsmouth        | 1 - 0   | liverpool         |        19529 |\n| 2        | sunderland        | 1 - 1   | birmingham city   |        24966 |\n| replay   | birmingham city   | 0 - 2   | sunderland        |        25645 |\n| 3        | sheffield united  | 1 - 0   | colchester united |        17074 |\n| 4        | tranmere rovers   | 2 - 1   | swansea city      |        12215 |\n| 5        | fulham            | 0 - 0   | west ham united   |        14705 |\n| replay   | west ham united   | 0 - 3   | fulham            |        27934 |\n| 6        | manchester united | 4 - 2   | manchester city   |        67228 |\n| 7        | millwall          | 1 - 0   | burnley           |        10420 |\n| 8        | arsenal           | 2 - 1   | chelsea           |        38136 |\n```\n   - The attendance of the other games is as follows:\n     ```markdown\n| tie no   | home team         | score   | away team         |   attendance |\n|:---------|:------------------|:--------|:------------------|-------------:|\n| 1        | liverpool         | 1 - 1   | portsmouth        |        34669 |\n| replay   | portsmouth        | 1 - 0   | liverpool         |        19529 |\n| 2        | sunderland        | 1 - 1   | birmingham city   |        24966 |\n| replay   | birmingham city   | 0 - 2   | sunderland        |        25645 |\n| 3        | sheffield united  | 1 - 0   | colchester united |        17074 |\n| 4        | tranmere rovers   | 2 - 1   | swansea city      |        12215 |\n| 5        | fulham            | 0 - 0   | west ham united   |        14705 |\n| replay   | west ham united   | 0 - 3   | fulham            |        27934 |\n| 6        | manchester united | 4 - 2   | manchester city   |        67228 |\n| 7        | millwall          | 1 - 0   | burnley           |        10420 |\n| 8        | arsenal           | 2 - 1   | chelsea           |        38136 |\n```\n\n3. Now, let's compare these attendance values.\n   - We can see that the highest attendance is 67228 (tie no 6).\n   - The second-highest attendance is 38136 (tie no 8).\n   - The third-highest attendance is 27934 (replay of tie no 5).\n\n4. Now, we need to compare these values to the attendance in tie no 7.\n   - We can see that the attendance value for tie no 7 (10420) is smaller than all three above it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"tie no 7 have the highest attendance out of all feature game\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Find the relevant cell for tie no 7.\",\n    \"Step 2: Compare the attendance of this game to all other games.\",\n    \"Step 3: Compare these values to the attendance in tie no 7.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

From the table, the attendance for tie no 1 is given in cell (1,5) which is 34669.\n3. Next, we need to find all other attendances from the remaining ties and sort them in descending order.\n4. Looking at the rest of the table, the attendance for replay tie between Liverpool and Portsmouth is 19529, for replay tie between Sunderland and Birmingham City is 25645, for replay tie between West Ham United and Fulham is 27934, and for the main match between Manchester United and Manchester City is 67228.\n5. Sorting these attendances in descending order we get: [67228, 27934, 25645, 34669, 24966, 19529].\n6. Comparing this sorted list to our original attendance figure (34669), we can see that 67228 is greater than it but the next highest is 27934.\n7. Since there are games with attendances higher and lower to 34669, we know there is more than one game in the table with a high attendance, so tie no 1 cannot be the only game with the second-highest attendance.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find attendance for tie no 1\",\n      \"cell\": {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find attendances of all remaining ties and sort them in descending order\",\n      \"cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare sorted list to original attendance figure\",\n      \"cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",
