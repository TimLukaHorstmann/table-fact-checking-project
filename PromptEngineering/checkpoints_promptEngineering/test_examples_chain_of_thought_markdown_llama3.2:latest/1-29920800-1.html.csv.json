Identify the relevant table data: The table shows information about each episode of a TV series, including the original air date, production code, and US viewers (in millions).\n\n2. Locate the first episode of Hot in Cleveland: In the given table, we need to find the row that corresponds to the first episode of Hot in Cleveland. To do this, we should check if any of the titles match \"Hot in Cleveland\".\n\n3. Check the original air date and production code for the first episode: Since the claim mentions the \"first episode\" specifically, we must verify that the first episode's data meets the criteria set by the claim.\n\n4. Extract relevant information from the table:\n   - For the row with \"pilot\", it is under the column \"title\" as \"pilot\", and has an original air date of June 16, 2010.\n   - There are no other rows where the title directly matches \"Hot in Cleveland\".\n\n5. Check if the first episode's viewership (4.75 million) is indeed higher than the viewership for any other episode:\n   - Compare this with each subsequent row.\n\n6. Analyze all data to determine if Hot in Cleveland's pilot has the highest viewer count.\n\n7. From analyzing all relevant cells, we can see that \"pilot\" has a larger viewership of 4.75 million compared to the viewership for other episodes.\n\n8.
