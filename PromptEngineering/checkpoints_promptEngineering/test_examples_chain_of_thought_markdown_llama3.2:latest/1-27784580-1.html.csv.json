    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the row in the table with the most recent broadcast date. Looking at the table, we can see that the latest broadcast date is June 14, 2010 (row ep 6).\n\n2. Next, we need to find the corresponding cell for \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" and the title with the most recent broadcast date in row ep 6. The title with the most recent broadcast date in row ep 6 is \"\u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\u5e8f\u5e55\u30fb\u5225\u308c\" (in romanized form) or \"\" (in translation), not \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\".\n\n3. Since we are looking for a comparison between two ratings, and one of them (\"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\") does not match the title in row ep 6, it appears that we cannot directly compare these two ratings.\n\n4. However, I noticed that there was another matching entry: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" is actually in a different episode (ep 3). We should calculate its rating relative to this one.\n\n5. Next, we need to find the corresponding cell for the title with the most recent broadcast date in row ep 3 and then compare it to the rating of \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" in row ep 3. The title in row ep 3 is \"\u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\" (in romanized form) or \"the proposal out of revenge\" (in translation).\n\n6. Now, we need to determine if the rating of \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (15.6%) is indeed 2.2% higher than that of \"\u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\". The difference would be: 15.6 - 13.4 = 2.2.\n\n7. Finally, we can see that the claim is true since the difference between the two ratings matches the specified percentage (2.2%).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"Identify row with most recent broadcast date\"},\n    {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"Verify corresponding cell for 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' and title in row ep 6 match\"},\n    {\"step\": 3, \"description\": \"Realize mismatch between 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' and its title in row ep 6\"},\n    {\"step\": 4, \"description\": \"Find 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' in another episode (ep 3)\"},\n    {\"step\": 5, \"description\": \"Compare rating of 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' to that of '\u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba'\"},\n    {\"step\": 6, \"description\": \"Verify if difference is exactly 2.2%\"},\n    {\"step\": 7, \"description\": \"Conclusion based on comparison\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"romanized title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}",

Now let's check if it comes after any of them:\n- Between `may 10 , 2010` and `may 17 , 2010`\n- Between `may 17 , 2010` and `may 24 , 2010`\n- Between `may 24 , 2010` and `may 31 , 2010`\n\nClearly, \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (`ep 5`) is before all of these dates.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the question specifically asks if `suki to ietara iinoni` is the second most recent episode and we have found that it comes after all episodes with their earliest broadcast date being on or after May 10, 2010, we conclude:\n\n- It's not among those more recent ones mentioned.\n- Thus, there isn't one to compare it directly for second most recent.\n\nTherefore,\n- The claim `suki to ietara iinoni` is the second most recent broadcast date is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Identify relevant information in table and assess the question's wording. suki to ietara iinoni's broadcast date comes after all those on or before May 10, 2010.

First, we need to identify the ratings for each episode.\n   - The claim mentions that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a rating 4% higher than the title with the lowest rating.\n\n2. Next, let's find out which episode has the lowest rating.\n   Looking at the table, we can see that the lowest rated episode is \"\u5fa9\u8b90\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba (fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu)\" with a rating of 15.6%.\n\n3. Now, let's determine what the actual rating of \"suki to ietara iinoni\" would be if it had 4% higher than that.\n   - To do this we have to calculate 4% of 15.6%\n   - 0.04 * 15.6 = 0.624\n   - Add the calculated value to the lowest rating: 15.6 + 0.624 = 16.224\n\n4. Now let's look at \"suki to ietara iinoni\" to see if it actually has this high rating:\n   Looking at the table we can verify that its actual rating is indeed 17.4% which is very close but not exactly equal to 16.224%.\n\n5. Lastly, determine if the claim about \"suki to ietara iinoni\" having a 4% higher rating than the episode with the lowest rating in the table is true or false:\n   - Given that its actual rating is 17.4%, we can say it has more than a 4% difference from the title with the lowest rating.\n   - Therefore, \"suki to ietara iinoni\" does have more than 4% higher ratings than the episode with the lowest rated which makes this claim TRUE.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the claim and its requirements\",\n      \"content\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Find out which episode has the lowest rating.\",\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"ratings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Determine what the actual rating of \\\"suki to ietara iinoni\\\" would be if it had 4% higher than that.

Next, we need to find the title with the earliest broadcast date among the \"arienai kisu\" episodes. In this case, it is episode ep 2.\n3. Now, we have two dates: May 24, 2010 (ep 3) and June 7, 2010 (ep 5). We need to find which of these was broadcasted 14 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date, which is \"arienai kisu\" episodes.\n4. Calculate the difference between May 10, 2010, and May 24, 2010:\n   - 14 days (May 24, 2010) - 14 days (May 10, 2010) = 14\n   Since the first date is earlier than May 24, 2010, and the second date was broadcasted after it. Therefore May 24, 2010 date should be compared with June 7, 2010:\n    - 14 days (June 7, 2010) - 14 days (May 24, 2010) = 14\n5. Since both dates are equidistant from the \"arienai kisu\" episode's broadcast date, we need to verify if there is indeed another title with a similar broadcast date that occurred more than 14 days after \"arienai kisu\", which would have led us away from our calculation in step 4.

Next, we need to find the ratings of both \"\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\" (arienai kisu) and the title with the earliest broadcast date (\"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\").\n   The rating for \"\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\" is given as 19.2%.\n   The rating for \"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\" is given as 22.4%.\n\n3. Now, we need to calculate the difference in ratings between \"\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\" and \"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\".\n   To do this, subtract the rating of \"\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\" from the rating of \"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\": 22.4% - 19.2% = 3.2%.\n\n4. Finally, we need to determine if the calculated difference is equal to 5.8%.\n   Since 3.2% is not equal to 5.8%, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Find title with earliest broadcast date\",\n      \"table\": \"episode title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Find ratings of both titles\",\n      \"table\": \"ratings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Calculate difference in ratings\",\n      \"table\": \"ratings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Determine if difference equals 5.8%\",\n      \"table\": \"ratings\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"episode title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"ratings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
