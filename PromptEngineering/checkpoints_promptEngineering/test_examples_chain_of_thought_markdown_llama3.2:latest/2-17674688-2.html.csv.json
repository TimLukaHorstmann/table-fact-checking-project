    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. We need to verify if Poland and France indeed receive 1 of each medal.\n2. Let's look at the relevant cells for both countries:\n   - For Poland, we have the cell at row_index=5 and column_name=\"silver\" which has a value of 0, indicating that Poland did not win any silver medals. The cell at row_index=5 and column_name=\"bronze\" has a value of 1, indicating that Poland won one bronze medal.\n   - For France, we have the cell at row_index=3 and column_name=\"silver\" which has a value of 1, indicating that France did win one silver medal. The cell at row_index=3 and column_name=\"bronze\" has a value of 0, indicating that France did not win any bronze medals.\n\n3. Based on the values in these cells, it appears that the claim is FALSE because Poland won only one bronze medal (not both), while the claim states that Poland should have won one silver and one bronze medal.\n\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1\",\n      \"description\": \"Verify if Poland and France receive 1 of each medal\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2.1\",\n      \"description\": \"Check silver medals for Poland\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2.2\",\n      \"description\": \"Check bronze medals for Poland\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2.3\",\n      \"description\": \"Check silver medals for France\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2.4\",\n      \"description\": \"Check bronze medals for France\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3\",\n      \"description\": \"Based on values in cells, the claim is FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
