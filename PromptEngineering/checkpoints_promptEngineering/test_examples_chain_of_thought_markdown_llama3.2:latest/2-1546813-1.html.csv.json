    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that the Solheim Cup was hosted in the US from 1990 to 2013, a total of 7 times.\n2. We need to check if there are indeed 7 host years between 1990 and 2013.\n3. Looking at the table, we can count the number of rows that fall within this time period:\n   - 2005 (USA hosts in 2005)\n   - 2009 (USA hosts in 2009)\n   - 2011 (Europe hosts in 2011 is not relevant for our purpose)\n   - 2013 (USA hosts in 2013)\n4. It seems like we are missing three years to reach a total of seven host years.\n5. Let's check if the Solheim Cup was hosted by the US in those remaining years:\n   - 1998 and 2002 have USA as winning team, but year is not after 2013\n   - No other relevant hosts from 2011 to 1990\n\n6. However, re-checking years around 1990, we notice that it was hosted by the US in 1994.\n7. So our list now looks like this:\n   - 2005 (USA hosts in 2005)\n   - 2009 (USA hosts in 2009)\n   - 2013 (USA hosts in 2013)\n   - 1990\n   - 1998\n\nIt seems we're short of one year.\n\nHowever, if the USA won those years between 1998 and 1994 I would need more information about Solheim Cup winning teams to determine if indeed it was hosted by the US.\n\nLet's try another path:\nLooking at our previous observations around the date range [2005-2013], since we found one host year in that list, let's look for other dates before that period. We can see that the following USA wins were between 1994 and 2002\n   - 1998\n   - 2000\n   - 2002\n\nWe've now added three to our total:\n   - 2005 (USA hosts in 2005)\n   - 2009 (USA hosts in 2009)\n   - 2013 (USA hosts in 2013)\n   - 1994\n   - 2000\n   - 2002\n\nWe are now one host year away from our goal.\n\nWe have also noticed that between 1990 and 1994, the year was hosted by europe. So we've got:\n   - 2005 (USA hosts in 2005)\n   - 2009 (USA hosts in 2009)\n   - 2013 (USA hosts in 2013)\n   - 1994\n   - 2000\n   - 2002\n   - 1998\n\nAnd with our latest addition, we now have a total of seven host years.\n\n**chain_of_thought**: \n[\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"The claim states that the Solheim Cup was hosted in the US from 1990 to 2013, a total of 7 times.\",\n        \"action\": \"Check if there are indeed 7 host years between 1990 and 2013.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"Looking at the table, we can count the number of rows that fall within this time period\",\n        \"action\": \"Count relevant rows in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"It seems like we are missing three years to reach a total of seven host years.\",\n        \"action\": \"Look for additional host years between 2011 and 1990\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"No other relevant hosts from 2011 to 1990\",\n        \"action\": \"Re-check years around 1990\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"If the USA won those years between 1998 and 1994, I would need more information about Solheim Cup winning teams to determine if indeed it was hosted by the US.\",\n        \"action\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"Looking at our previous observations around the date range [2005-2013], since we found one host year in that list\",\n        \"action\": \"Look for additional host years between 1998 and 2002\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"We've now added three to our total: 2005, 2009, 2013, 1994, 2000, 2002.\",\n        \"action\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"observation\": \"We have also noticed that between 1990 and 1994, the year was hosted by europe.

However, since we found a case where the lowest winning team's score was as low as 6\u00bd and another instance where it was 4\u00bd, it indicates the claim might not be universally applicable.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since there are instances where scores go below 11.5 for the winning teams, the claim is not entirely true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate relevant data points\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find the highest winning team's score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Find the lowest winning team's score\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Analyze if the claim holds\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}",

The table shows the year, venue, winning team, score, USA captain, Europe captain for each match of the Solheim Cup from 1990 to 2013.\n3. To determine if Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth are all captains who won the Solheim Cup only once, we need to check their wins in the table:\n   - Patty Sheehan is shown as the captain of the United States team in 2002 with a score of 15\u00bd - 12\u00bd. Since there is no mention of her winning individually, it can be assumed she won this match as part of her overall performance as US Captain.\n   - Judy Rankin is mentioned as the captain of the United States team in 1998 with a score of 16 - 12, and also as one of the captains in 1996 with a score of 17 - 11. This means she won twice as part of her overall performance as US Captain.\n   - Kathy Whitworth is shown as the captain of Europe in 1992 with a score of 11\u00bd - 6\u00bd. There is no information about her winning an individual Solheim Cup match, but it's assumed that since it was not mentioned, she won only this one time.\n\n4. Now we can determine if Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin and Kathy Whitworth are all captains who have won the Solheim Cup only once by comparing the results to their respective number of wins:\n   - Patty Sheehan has 1 win as captain in 2002.\n   - Judy Rankin has 2 wins as captain (1996 and 1998).\n   - Kathy Whitworth has 1 confirmed win as captain in 1992.\n\n5. As per the table, only one of these captains won the Solheim Cup only once according to the data provided:\n   Patty Sheehan is shown as winning only once in 2002.\n   Judy Rankin and Kathy Whitworth are both shown as having more than one win each, based on their performance as US Captain.\n\n6. Given the information above, we can now provide a final answer to the question of whether Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin and Kathy Whitworth be all captain that win the Solheim Cup 1 time:\n\nBased on our analysis, only one captain (Patty Sheehan) has won the Solheim Cup only once.
