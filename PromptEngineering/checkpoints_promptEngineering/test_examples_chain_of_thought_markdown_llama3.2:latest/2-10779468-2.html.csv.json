We can do this by looking at their scores in the table.\n\n*   For Baylor, its overall record against Texas is 'ut , 57 - 23'.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim mentions that the Texas Longhorns' women's basketball table shows game vs only 1 team show score on different location.\n2. To verify this, we need to check if there is at least one row in the table where the \"opponent's venue\" column has a value that is different from the \"neutral site\" column.\n3. We can also use the claim as an additional filter and only look for rows where the score is not 0 (since it would be hard to show a game with no participants).\n4. Looking at the table, we can see that the row for Texas A&M has a different value in the \"opponent's venue\" column compared to the \"neutral site\" column.\n5. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the score for this row is 58 - 15, which means it was played on a neutral site (the table does not show the actual location).\n6. Similarly, we can see that the row for Oklahoma State has a different value in the \"opponent's venue\" column compared to the \"neutral site\" column.\n7. The score for this row is 21 - 7, which also indicates it was played on a neutral site.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the table again, I notice that there are indeed rows where the score is not 0, such as for Kansas State (10-8) and Oklahoma State (21-7), but these do have different values in \"opponent's venue\" and \"neutral site\". But looking closer we see the cell for this row shows it was played on a neutral location. Thus both the rows are invalid according to our claim.\n\nHowever let's check another row. Looking at the table, I notice that there is also a row for Texas Tech.\n8. The score for this row is 55 - 24, which indicates it was played on a different location (neither neutral nor opponent's venue).\n\n9.

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that \"in the first 10 meetings, the score be tie, 5 - 5 4 time and 2 time at ut , 8 - 2\"\n   \n2. **Locate relevant information in the table**:\n   - First, we need to find the overall record of each team for the first 10 meetings.\n   - We can then compare these records with the claim.\n\n3. **Check overall record of Texas vs. UTEP for the first 10 meetings**: \n   Looking at the table, the row for \"texas\" has a column named \"ut , 14 - 4\". This suggests that in the first 10 meetings, Texas and UTEP have had an overall score of 14-4.\n\n4. **Check overall record of Texas vs. UTEP for the last 5 meetings**: \n   Similarly, looking at the same row, it is mentioned as \"ut , 7 - 2\" in the last 5 meetings section.\n\n5. **Calculate how many times the score was tie ( 5-5) in the first 10 meetings and at UTEP**: Since we don't know the exact number of ties from this table alone, let's look for any rows that have a column with \"tie\" mentioned in it.\n   - The relevant row is \"oklahoma\", which has the line \"tied , 7 - 7\" for overall first 10 meetings. However, we should focus on Texas vs UTEP directly.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: From step 4 and 5, it's evident that we can't find any rows matching exactly with \"ut , 8 - 2\" from the table but only one instance where the score was tie (5-5) in overall record of the first 10 meetings for Texas vs UTEP.\n\n7. **Conclusion after revisiting step 6**: We did not see any other column that would be exactly \"ut , 8 - 2\". However, we know Texas has had more ties against UTEP in their last 5 and 10 meetings. To get the exact numbers of times when it was tie at UT for first ten meetings, we have to assume a lot of information not provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After analyzing the table, we found that while Texas had ties against UTEP (specifically with overall record for first 10 meetings showing 14-4 and last 5 showing 7-2), there is no column explicitly stating 'ut , 8 - 2'. This makes it difficult to verify the claim directly from this table.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"last 5 meetings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"}\n  ]\n}",

For Texas (not explicitly mentioned in the claim but assumed to be an opponent), the overall record is listed as \"ut , 57 - 23\".
