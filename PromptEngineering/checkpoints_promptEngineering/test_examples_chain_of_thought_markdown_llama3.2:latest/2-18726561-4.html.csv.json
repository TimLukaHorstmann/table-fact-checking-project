We can do this by looking at the \"score\" column.\n\n### Step 2: Check if all drawn matches have a goalless result\nNext, we need to check if all of these drawn matches resulted in a goalless game. This means that we should verify if there is only one match with no goals scored out of the total number of drawn matches.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of drawn matches with a goalless result\nCounting the relevant rows, we can see that two of the drawn matches ended up being goalless:\n\n* `6` - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Ipswich Town (goalless)\n* `13` - Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth (goalless)\n\n### Step 4: Check if all other drawn matches have goals scored\nNow, we need to verify that the other drawn match was also goalless or not:\n\n* `replay` - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Ipswich Town (1-0)\n* `replay` - Portsmouth vs. Charlton Athletic (3-0)\n\nIt appears that only one of these two matches ended up being goalless, but we need to determine if this meets the condition.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the relevance of each cell\nSince the problem asks about \"only 1 of the 3 drawn match be goalless\", we can see that there are indeed more than three drawn games. However, in the table, it seems like most drawn matches ended up being a 0-0 draw or had at least one score other than zero. Looking further into the data, we will find out how many were actually goalless.\n\n### Step 6: Count the total number of drawn matches\nThere are two relevant cells that show drawn matches:\n\n* `replay` - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Ipswich Town (1-0)\n* `replay` - Portsmouth vs. Charlton Athletic (3-0)\n\nHowever, let's verify if we missed any other drawn games or if there were more goalless draws.\n\n### Step 7: Confirm the answer\nUpon reviewing our reasoning process again, it appears that we did not find any instances where all three of these drawn matches resulted in a 0-0 score.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states \"2 match be pay in february\". This means we need to check if there was a payment made for a match on February 24, 1976.\n\n2. To do this, let's look at the table and find the rows that occur on January 24, 1976 (the date before February). \n\n3. Looking at the dates in the table, we see the following matches took place on January 24, 1976: \n   - Southampton vs Blackpool\n   - Leicester City vs Bury\n   - West Bromwich Albion vs Lincoln City\n   - Sunderland vs Hull City\n   - Derby County vs Liverpool\n   - Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers\n   - Coventry City vs Newcastle United\n\n4. We need to check if there was a payment for any of the matches on January 24, 1976.\n\n5. Looking at the \"score\" column, we see that in all of these matches, the scores are either 3-1 or 0-0 (in the case of the replay between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town).\n\n6. There is no match on February 24, 1976, with a score of 3-1.\n\n7. Therefore, there was indeed a payment for at least one of these matches on January 24, 1976 (the only non-zero-score match that day). We have to determine if all the other non-paying matches also took place before February 2, or just any two matches.\n\n8. Looking again at our list from earlier in step 5, we see that only Coventry City vs Newcastle United and Southampton vs Blackpool had scores greater than 0.\n\n9. Checking the \"date\" column again, we find both of these match dates occur on January 24, 1976. We also need to check Derby County vs Liverpool because if a payment can't be made for that one (due to a different date than February), then any other non-paying match can't be paid.\n\n10. Upon re-checking the date of that match in the table we find Derby County vs Liverpool was on January 24, 1976 as well. And only Coventry City vs Newcastle United had its second match played after February 2 (the first one was on January 24).\n\n11. Checking the \"score\" column for the other non-paying matches from earlier shows that all of them were also played before January 24.\n\n12. Looking at the relevant dates in steps 7-11, we see that Derby County vs Liverpool was not paid because its date was on February 2 (the first match was on January 24).\n\n13. Since one of the two matches is not paid then only one payment can be made for any other non-paying match to be included.\n\n14. We know since there was a match with score greater than zero played before February 2 and we are looking at only one of the possible pay dates, if all but this match were also on January 24 or less, that means these matches must have happened first (all but Derby County vs Liverpool), meaning their payment date can be before February 2.\n\n15. Since we've determined two of the non-paying matches must have occurred before the others, there is no way for any other payment to occur in february, as all other payments would need to happen on January 24 or earlier.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"description\": \"The claim states \\\"2 match be pay in february\\\".\"},\n    {\"description\": \"We need to check if there was a payment made for a match on February 24, 1976.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Looking at the dates in the table, we see the following matches took place on January 24, 1976:\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   - Southampton vs Blackpool\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   - Leicester City vs Bury\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   - West Bromwich Albion vs Lincoln City\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   - Sunderland vs Hull City\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   - Derby County vs Liverpool\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   - Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   - Coventry City vs Newcastle United\"},\n    {\"description\": \"We need to check if there was a payment for any of these matches.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Looking at the scores in the table, we see that in all of these matches,\"},\n    {\"description\": \"   the scores are either 3-1 or 0-0 (in the case of the replay between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town).\"},\n    {\"description\": \"There is no match on February 24, 1976, with a score of 3-1.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Therefore, there was indeed a payment for at least one of these matches on January 24, 1976.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"We have to determine if all the other non-paying matches also took place before February 2,\"},\n    {\"description\": \"or just any two matches.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Looking again at our list from earlier in step 5, we see that only Coventry City vs Newcastle United had scores greater than 0.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Checking the date column again, we find both of these match dates occur on January 24, 1976.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"We also need to check Derby County vs Liverpool because if a payment can't be made for that one,\"},\n    {\"description\": \"(due to a different date than February), then any other non-paying match can't be paid.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Upon re-checking the date of that match in the table we find Derby County vs Liverpool was on January 24, 1976 as well.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"And only Coventry City vs Newcastle United had its second match played after February 2 (the first one was on January 24).\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Checking the scores column for the other non-paying matches from earlier shows that all of them were also played before January 24.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Looking at the relevant dates in steps 7-11, we see that Derby County vs Liverpool was not paid because its date was on February 2\"},\n    {\"description\": \"(the first match was on January 24)\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Since one of the two matches is not paid then only one payment can be made for any other non-paying match to be included.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"We know since there was a match with score greater than zero played before February 2 and we are looking at only one of the possible pay dates,\"},\n    {\"description\": \"if all but this match were also on January 24 or less, that means these matches must have happened first (all but Derby County vs Liverpool),\"},\n    {\"description\": \"meaning their payment date can be before February 2.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"Since we've determined two of the non-paying matches must have occurred before the others,\"},\n    {\"description\": \"there is no way for any other payment to occur in february, as all other payments would need to happen on January 24 or earlier.\"},\n    {\"description\": \"We know since there was a match with score greater than zero played before February 2 and we are looking at only one of the possible pay dates,\"}\n  ],\n  \"description\": \"Since Derby County vs Liverpool was not paid, it means that all non-paying matches must have occurred on January 24 or less.\"},\n  \"result\": \"Only one payment can be made in february.\"},\n}\n```",

In football, a match is considered a draw if both teams score an equal number of goals and there are no more games in the tournament for those two teams at that point.\n\n```markdown\n# Step 2: Identify Drawn Matches\n| tie no   | home team               | score   | away team                | date            |\n|:---------|:------------------------|:--------|:-------------------------|:----------------|\n| 6        | ipswich town            | 0 - 0   | wolverhampton wanderers  | 24 january 1976 |\n| replay   | wolverhampton wanderers | 1 - 0   | ipswich town             | 27 january 1976 |\n| 13       | charlton athletic       | 1 - 1   | portsmouth               | 24 january 1976 |\n| replay   | portsmouth              | 0 - 3   | charlton athletic        | 27 january 1976 |\n```\n\n- Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers ended in a draw with both teams scoring zero goals.\n- Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth also ended in a draw, but only after their replay.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Claim\nSince there are two draws mentioned (Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers and Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth), we need to verify if both were indeed goalless.\n\n```markdown\n# Step 3: Verify Both Draws Were Goalless\nBoth Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers (0 - 0) and Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth (1 - 1 after the replay, but Portsmouth won 3 - 0 in the first match), were indeed goalless.\n```\n\n- Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers was goalless.\n\n### Step 4: Final Analysis\nGiven that both draws, Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers and Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth, were indeed goalless, we can conclude the claim is true.\n\n```markdown\n# Step 4: Conclusion\nAll three drawn matches be goalless.\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze the Claim\",\n    \"Identify Drawn Matches\",\n    \"Verify Both Draws Were Goalless\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
