Locate the specific rows that correspond to the years mentioned in the claim (1998 and 2008) according to the \"date\" column.\n   For 1998, the row with \"number\": 6 has a date of \"1998\". \n   For 2008, the row with \"number\": 9 has a date of \"2008\".\n\n3. Determine the value in the \"builder\" column for each of these identified rows to confirm that North Dorset Locomotive Works is indeed listed as the builder for both dates.\n   The row with \"number\": 6 has \"north dorset locomotive works\" as its builder, and the row with \"number\": 9 also has \"north dorset locomotive works\" as its builder.\n\n4.

This means that the type '4wdh' is used only twice between 1973 and 2008.\n\n### Step 3: Check if any other dates match within this period\nIn addition to the two rows with type '4wdh', there are also two more rows with type '4wdh' (rows 5 and 6), but row 6 has a date of 1998, not outside this period. Furthermore, we can see that another entry exists in year 2008 for the same type.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nGiven our findings in step 3, there are indeed at least three occurrences of 'type 4wdh' within the specified time frame, one in 1998 and two more in 1998 and 2008.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant rows for claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Count occurrences of type '4wdh'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Check if any other dates match within this period\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\",\n      \"conclusion\": \"There are more than 2 entries for this type between the years specified\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Alan Keef is listed under \"number\" 5, and the North Dorset Locomotive Works is listed under \"builder\".\n\n|   number | name   | builder                       | type       |   date |\n|---------:|:-------|:------------------------------|:-----------|-------:|\n|        1 | amanda | gartell light railway         | bo - bodh  |   2000 |\n|        2 | andrew | baguley - drewry              | 4wdh       |   1973 |\n|        5 | alison | alan keef                     | 4wdh       |   1993 |\n|        6 | mr g   | north dorset locomotive works | 0 - 4 - 2t |   1998 |\n|        9 | jean   | north dorset locomotive works | 0 - 4 - 0  |   2008 |\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of times each was used\n- The North Dorset Locomotive Works was used in \"2000\", \"1998\", and \"2008\", which are 3 instances.\n- Alan Keef's locomotive was used in \"1993\", which is 1 instance.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the usage counts\nSince 1 (Alan Keef) < 3 (North Dorset Locomotive Works), the claim that \"the north dorset locomotive work be use less than alan keef overall\" is TRUE.\n\n### Step 6: Identify relevant cells for output\nThe relevant cells are:\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"builder\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Step 7: Output the final answer in JSON format\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim's components\",\n    \"Determine what be use means in the context of locomotive works usage\",\n    \"Extract relevant information from the table\",\n    \"Count the number of times each was used\",\n    \"Compare the usage counts\",\n    \"Identify relevant cells for output\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"builder\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
