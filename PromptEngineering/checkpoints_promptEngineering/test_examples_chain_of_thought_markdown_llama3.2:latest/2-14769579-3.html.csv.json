Review the table to find the location for the year 1986: The relevant cells for the year 1986 are | year | location   | ...|, which shows \"seoul\" as the location.\n\n2. Check if there is any other instance where the same location appears in a different year: We check the locations of the years prior and following to see if Seoul has appeared anywhere else.\n\n3. If we find any instances where Seoul is not in 1986 but appears at some other point, then our initial finding will be false. So, our first task is to look at other entries for \"location\" that have \"seoul\".\n\n4. Look at each year row:\n   - For the year 1978, we see that the location was \"bangkok\".\n   - For the year 1982, we see that the location was \"new delhi\".\n   - For the year 1990, we see that the location was \"beijing\".\n   - For the year 1994, we see that the location was \"hiroshima\".\n   - For the year 1998, we see that the location was \"bangkok\".\n   - For the year 2002, we see that the location was \"busan\".\n   - For the year 2006, we see that the location was \"doha\".\n   - For the year 2010, we see that the location was \"guangzhou\".\n\n5. Now looking for any instance where Seoul appears outside of 1986, and it does in 1998.\n\n6.

Thus, the relevant cell object is:\n     ```\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Next, we find the year when Im Dong-hyun won gold.\n   - We look at the table row for 2006, where it says \"gold\" is won by \"im dong - hyun\". Thus, the relevant cell object is:\n     ```\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Then, we need to find if Im Dong-hyun won gold before Kim Woo-jin.\n   - We see that Im Dong-hyun won gold in 2006 and Kim Woo-jin won gold in 2010. Thus, Kim Woo-jin won after Im Dong-hyun.\n\n4. Next, we check the location where both events occurred.\n   - The location is \"doha\" for Im Dong-hyun and \"guangzhou\" for Kim Woo-jin. Since Doha is not a location in Africa, the claim is false.\n\n5. Now, we need to find if there are any locations in Africa in the table.\n   - We see that there is no such location in the given table.\n\n6. Finally, we check if the year of the events is correct.\n   - Since there's no other data or information that could affect this result in our case and since Im Dong-hyun won gold in 2006 and Kim Woo-jin won gold in 2010, both years are after 1978.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: We need to find the year when Kim Woo-jin won gold.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 2: Next, we find the year when Im Dong-hyun won gold.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Then, we need to find if Im Dong-hyun won gold before Kim Woo-jin.
