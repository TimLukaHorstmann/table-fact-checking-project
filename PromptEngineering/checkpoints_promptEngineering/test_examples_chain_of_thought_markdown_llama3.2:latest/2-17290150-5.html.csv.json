First, we need to examine the \"score\" column of the table to see if any golfer scored a +8.\n2. We can do this by looking at each row in the table and checking if the score is equal to 148 (since a +8 means that the score is 8 strokes over par).\n3. For example, let's look at the third row: \"t3      | julius boros      | united states | 76 + 69 = 145 | + 5\". This row does not have a score of +8.\n4. However, we can see that there is one row where the score is indeed equal to 148: \"t7      | sam snead         | united states | 79 + 69 = 148 | + 8\".\n5. We also notice another row with the same score: \"t7      | bob harris        | united states | 79 + 69 = 148 | + 8\". This confirms that there are indeed at least two golfers who scored a +8.\n6. Finally, we can see that there is a third row with the same score as well: \"t7      | jack burke , jr   | united states | 71 + 77 = 148 | + 8\".\n7.
