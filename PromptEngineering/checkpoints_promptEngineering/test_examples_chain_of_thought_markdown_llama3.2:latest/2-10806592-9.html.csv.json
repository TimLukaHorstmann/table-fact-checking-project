    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the columns to consider for the claim\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to look at two specific columns: \"home team score\" and \"away team score\". We are interested in rows where either of these scores is less than 10.\n\n### Step 2: Filter rows based on the condition (score < 10)\nWe will scan each row in the table to see if either the home team's score or the away team's score is less than 10. If we find a match, we'll note it down as part of our chain of thought.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Hawthorn and South Melbourne\nThe claim specifically mentions two teams (Hawthorn and South Melbourne). We need to check if both these teams are among those whose scores are less than 10. This step ensures that the claim's focus on \"only 2 team\" is accurate.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm if other teams meet the score criteria\nAfter confirming Hawthorn and South Melbourne, we also need to check if any other teams have a score less than 10 to see if they should be excluded from the count of only two teams meeting this criterion.\n\n### Step 5: Compile chain of thought with relevant cell information\nEach step will involve referencing specific cells in the table. By listing these references, we can provide detailed evidence for our reasoning process.\n\n### Finalizing Answer Based on Reasoning\n\nThe steps above lead us to examine all scores less than 10 across the table to see if indeed only two teams meet this criterion.\n\nHere's how it breaks down with specific cell references:\n\n- Step 1: Identifying relevant columns and potential scoring teams, referencing cells like A2 (Hawthorn), B2 (South Melbourne), etc.\n- Step 2 & 3: Scanning rows for scores less than 10 and noting Hawthorn and South Melbourne immediately as per the claim, alongside possibly other scores that could be under 10.\n  \nGiven these steps and the fact that only two teams meet the specific criteria mentioned in the claim (Hawthorn and South Melbourne), we proceed to:\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Rank the teams by their scores: Compare the away scores for all teams played on June 18th.\n3. Determine the highest and second-highest score teams: Rank the teams based on their away scores from step 1.\n4. Check if Carlton is in the top two:\n\t* Carlton's score (121) is greater than many of the highest scores.\n\t* The team with a higher score than 121 is Melbourne (112), but it has the highest score, so we must look for teams that have lower than 112 and higher than 121.\n\t* Fitzroy has a score of 108 which is less than Carlton's 121, however, its rank is still ahead of other teams with scores higher than 121.\n5. Evaluate the claim based on steps 4-5:\nSince Carlton has a high score (121) that ranks in the top two but not as the highest, it indeed can be considered the second-highest among the teams played on June 18th.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the claim to be evaluated**: The claim states that \"no game on the 18th of june draw a crowd of more fewer than 20000\".\n\n2. **Locate relevant cells in the table**: We need to find rows where the venue is not Punt Road Oval (where the largest crowd is recorded) and verify if any other row has a crowd greater than or equal to 20000.\n\n3. **Search for rows with large crowds on 18th June**: The only venues mentioned that are relevant in this case, based on our claim, would be Brunswick Street Oval, Corio Oval, Junction Oval, Punt Road Oval (where the largest crowd is recorded) and Western Oval, all of which have a known attendance greater than or equal to 20000. It seems there's been an error in identifying the most relevant cells for this particular query.\n\n4. **Evaluate if any other row has a crowd larger than 20000**: Based on the data provided, we can observe that one venue has a much higher crowd count: Junction Oval (14000), which falls short of 20000 but does not disprove our original claim since it does not occur at Punt Road Oval.\n\n5. **Draw conclusion based on findings**: Our search was focused on finding any game with a crowd over or equal to 20000, specifically in the venue Punt Road Oval where the largest attendance was recorded, and we found none of these instances match the criteria for our claim (the absence of such games). Thus, our original assumption appears correct.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",
