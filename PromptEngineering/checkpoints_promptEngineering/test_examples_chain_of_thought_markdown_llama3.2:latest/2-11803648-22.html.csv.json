To verify this, we need to check the overall values for both players.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that Curtis Lazar has an overall value of 17 (in round 1) and another overall value is not provided for him in any other row.\n \n3. However, for Marcus Hogberg, there's another overall value provided which is 78 (in round 3). The claim does have a flaw here as he has one value above 100.\n\n4. We need to look at more values from Curtis Lazar now and check if his other overall value in any round is also above 100. However, no such information exists for him.\n\n\n\n5. For the claim to be true, we would need only one player with an overall below or equal to 100.
