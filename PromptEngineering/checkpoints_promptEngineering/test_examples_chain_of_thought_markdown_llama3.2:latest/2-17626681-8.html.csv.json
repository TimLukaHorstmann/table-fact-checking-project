We need to find the attendance values for these two matches in the table.\n   - For the 17th September 2008 match: The attendance is given as 74944.\n   - For the 30th September 2008 match: The attendance is given as 10346.\n\n3. Now, we can calculate if the attendance value of one match is indeed more than 60000 more than the other.\n   - Attendance at 17 September 2008 minus Attendance at 30 September 2008 = 74944 - 10346 = 64598\n\n4.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that 3 games out of 6 have an attendance of over 70000. These specific games are: September 30, 2008; November 5, 2008; and November 25, 2008.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant cells in the table**:\n   - We need to check the attendance for each of these dates.\n   - The row index for all three dates is needed (because they might not be consecutive).\n   - For each game, we also need its row index and column name \"attendance\".\n\n3. **Check attendance for September 30, 2008**:\n   - Row Index: We don't know yet because we have to find it.\n   - Column Name: We know it's \"attendance\".\n   - Value: Attendance is given as 10346.\n\n4. **Check attendance for November 5, 2008**:\n   - Row Index: Again, we don't know yet.\n   - Column Name: Still \"attendance\".\n   - Value: Attendance here is given as 58903.\n\n5. **Check attendance for November 25, 2008**:\n   - Row Index: We still don't know it.\n   - Column Name: Same, \"attendance\".\n   - Value: Here, attendance is provided as 22529.\n\n6. **Find the row index of September 30, 2008**:\n   - By looking at the table, we see that row number starts from 1 based on date in ascending order.\n   - Therefore, September 17th would be row 1, so September 30th would indeed be row 2.\n\n7. **Find the row index of November 5, 2008**:\n   - It\u2019s a bit tricky here since 'November' indicates it is later than 'October'. \n   - The first date in our claim (September 30) was already placed on row 1.\n   - Then comes October's dates followed by November's, so row numbers for these dates would be: 3 for the first game of November and then 4, and 5 respectively.\n\n8. **Find the row index of November 25, 2008**:\n   - Following our previous logic, after October (with two entries), we have November.\n   - Therefore, row number would start from 6 for the first date in November, but since it says '25', we are at row number 7.\n\n9. **Compare attendance values with claim**:\n   - For September 30: Attendance is less than 70000 (10346).\n   - For November 5: Attendance is more than 70000 (58903). Thus, this one supports the claim.\n   - For November 25: It\u2019s also less than 70000 (22529).\n\n10. **Conclusion**: Since only two games out of six have an attendance over 70000, and the statement specifically claims that exactly three games meet this condition which is incorrect based on our calculations.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the specific dates mentioned in the claim\nThe claim mentions three specific dates: September, October, and December.\n\n### Step 2: Look up the number of games played on each date in the table\n- For September: There are two games played (on 17th and 30th). This matches the claim.\n- For October: There are two games played (on 21st and 5th). This matches the claim.\n- For December: There is one game played (on 10th). This does not match the claim.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate if all conditions of the claim are met\nSince the number of games in September and October matches the claim but the number in December does not, the entire statement cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states there should be 2 games played in each month (september & october) but only 1 game. However, in september & october both conditions are met. So we must look at december. There is indeed only 1 game which breaks the chain of true for the entire claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}",
