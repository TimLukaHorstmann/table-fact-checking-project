    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. To verify the claim, I need to check if Germany won more gold medals than the United Kingdom at the 2008 FIBT World Championship.\n\n2. First, I should look up the total number of gold medals won by each country in the table. According to the table, Germany won 5 gold medals and the United Kingdom won 1 gold medal.\n\n3. Next, I need to check if Germany won more gold medals than the United Kingdom. Since 5 (Germany's gold medals) is greater than 1 (the United Kingdom's gold medals), this condition is met.\n\n4. However, the claim also states that Germany \"win more 4\" gold medals than the United Kingdom. This implies that I need to check if Germany won exactly 9 gold medals in total (5 + 4). \n\n   - Looking at the table again, Germany's total number of medals is indeed 11, which includes both gold and other metals.\n\n5. Since Germany's total gold medals do not match the claim (Germany did not win \"more 4\" than the UK), this means that the claim cannot be true according to the provided data.\n\n6. However, we need to verify that the number of additional medals Germany won is indeed '4' because if it were more or less than four then our assumption would be wrong thus being a false case. So checking again the table for Germany's total medals. According to the table germany have 11 and in the claim its stated as \"more 4\" which also means that they must have won more golds by '4' of their existing medals - (11-4 = 7) which is not equal to what was written on the table for united kingdom gold medal which is \"1\".\n\n6. Now looking at the other end of the spectrum. If it was less than 4, then the claim could be true.\n\n7. Given that we've determined earlier Germany won '7' gold medals, this means they indeed have more than the UK by '6' and in reality it can be said as \"more 1\" than united kingdom and not \"more 4\". Thus being a false statement.\n\n\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
