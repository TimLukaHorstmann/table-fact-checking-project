The home ground for both Nab and Salisbury United is not explicitly mentioned as \"Australia\".

Now, we need to find out when Gawler was founded (in the column \"founded\").\n   - Gawler team was founded in 1978, which is stated directly on the table at cell [2,5].\n\n3. Next, we determine the year Nab was founded.\n   - Looking at row 3 of the table for information related to the founding of Nab.\n\n4. Now that we know when both Gawler and Nab were founded, we can compare these dates to find out which one is found earlier by 11 years.\n   - If 1978 (Gawler's year) minus 11 equals 1967, then Gawler was indeed 11 years before the founding of Nab if that's correct.\n\n5. We must now go back to row 3 for the founding date of the team \"nab\".\n   - Nab's founded date is stated in the cell at [3,4].\n\n6. Now we calculate the year when \"nab\" was founded.\n   - According to row 3 of our table, nab was founded in 1989.\n\n7. Finally, we can verify if Gawler was indeed 11 years before Nab by performing a comparison between these two founding dates.\n   - Gawler (1978) minus 11 equals 1967.\n   - The team \"nab\" was founded at year 1989.\n   - Since 1989 is greater than the result of Gawlers' earlier date, it means we have made an error in our math or found the wrong founding date for Gawler.\n\n### JSON Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Start by identifying the team mentioned in the claim, which is \"Sturt Lions FC\". We need to check if this team was founded after all other teams.\n\n2. Look for the row with \"team\" as \"Sturt Lions FC\" and extract the relevant columns: \"founded\", \"location\", and \"home ground\". The founded date will be used to compare it with other teams' dates.\n\n   Relevant cells:\n   ```\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 10,\n     \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 10,\n     \"column_name\": \"location\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 10,\n     \"column_name\": \"home ground\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Now we will check if the founded date of Sturt Lions FC is more recent than other teams' dates by comparing with the most recently found team.\n\n4. Find all rows for which founded date is unknown (or missing). Since we do not have any such data, we will proceed to extract and compare the founded date of Sturt Lions FC with all other teams'.\n\n5. We find that  Sturt lions fc was founded in 2011 while western toros team has an unknown founded date. However, we can't draw a correct conclusion from this alone.\n\n6. Proceed by comparing Sturt Lions FC's founded date with the most recently found team. The last row is Sturt Lions fc at row index 10 and it was founded in 2011.\n\n7. Compare 2011 (Sturt lions fc) with unknown ( western toros). We know that a value larger than another will be more recent; thus 2011 is more recent than unknown.\n\n\n\n8. Since we found Sturt Lions FC to be the most recently founded team, we can conclude that the claim in the prompt is True.\n\n\n\n9.
