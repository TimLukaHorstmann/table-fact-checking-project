    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Read the claim**: The claim states that Lavar Johnson and Anthony Fuller be at the WEC 9 and WEC 8, respectively.\n2. **Locate relevant information in the table**:\n   - To verify the claim, we need to check if both fighters indeed competed at these events according to the table.\n3. **Verify fighter information for WEC 9**:\n   - Looking up Lavar Johnson in the table, his row is found at `row_index: 19` with `column_name: location` listed as `\"lemoore , california , united states\"`.\n   - However, there's no record of a WEC 9 event. We need to find if it was a different name or simply missed in the data provided.\n4. **Verify fighter information for WEC 8**:\n   - Looking up Anthony Fuller in the table, his row is found at `row_index: 20` with `column_name: location` listed as `\"lemoore , california , united states\"`.\n   - Again, no record of a WEC 8 event. We need to confirm if this was indeed \"WEC 8\" or just another event.\n5. **Consider how table data is structured**:\n   - Given that the column `event` contains the actual names of the fights (e.g., \"WEC 12\", \"Tachi Palace Fights: High Stakes\"), it's plausible that there might not be an entry for every possible WEC event. \n6. **Conclusion based on found data**:\n   - Since neither Lavar Johnson nor Anthony Fuller competed under an exact match of the name \"WEC 9\" or \"WEC 8\" as per their respective rows, we can only verify they did compete at the location provided but not necessarily in a fight named \"WEC 9\" or \"WEC 8\".\n\n### Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Read the claim\",\n      \"claim\": \"lavar johnson and anthony fulller be at the wec 9 and wec 8 , rspectively\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate relevant information in the table\",\n      \"table_info\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 19,\n          \"column_name\": \"location\",\n          \"value\": \"lemoore , california , united states\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 20,\n          \"column_name\": \"location\",\n          \"value\": \"lemoore , california , united states\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify fighter information for WEC 9\",\n      \"verification_result\": \"Missing data on actual event name 'WEC 9'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify fighter information for WEC 8\",\n      \"verification_result\": \"Missing data on actual event name 'WEC 8'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Claim Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the Claim\nThe claim states that both matches against James Irvin and Anthony Arria lasted less than a minute.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the Matches in the Table\nWe need to locate these two matches in the table to verify the duration of each fight. The table is as follows:\n\n| res   | record   | opponent          | method                                  | event                             |   round | time   | location                                   |\n|:------|:---------|:------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|--------:|:-------|:-------------------------------------------|\n| ...   | ...       | james irvin       | ko (knee)                               | wec 15                            |       2 | 0:45   | lemoore , california , united states       |\n| ...   | ...       | anthony arria     | submission ( armbar )                   | wec 10                            |       1 | 0:22   | lemoore , california , united states       |\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Duration of Each Fight\nJames Irvin vs. The claim mentions James Irvin, but his match's duration is 0:45 which is more than a minute.\n Anthony Arria vs. The claim also mentions Anthony Arria, and according to the table, their match lasted 0:22, which is indeed less than a minute.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify the Claim\nBased on our analysis, we can verify that one of the matches (Anthony Arria's) lasted less than a minute but the other does not. Therefore, we must consider both fights in the claim to be partially incorrect, meaning at least one did not last under a minute.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Claim states that matches against James Irvin and Anthony Arria lasted less than a minute\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Locate these two matches in the table to verify duration of each fight.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"James Irvin's match had a duration of 0:45 which is more than a minute.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to check if both brett cooper and kala hose were knocked out by a punch. To do this, we will look at each row of the table for both fighters.\n\n2. For brett cooper, let's start with the \"win\" rows: \n    - In the bellator 95 row, the method is listed as ko (punch), which means he was knocked out by a punch.\n    - Therefore, we can conclude that one of brett cooper's wins was indeed due to a knockout by punch.\n\n3. Next, let's look at kala hose:\n    - In the bellator 82 row, the method is listed as ko (punch), which means he was knocked out by a punch.\n    - Therefore, we can conclude that one of kala hose's wins was indeed due to a knockout by punch.\n\n4. Now let's check if both brett cooper and kala hose were knocked out by punch in their respective rows:\n    - In the bellator 95 row, brett cooper was knocked out by punch.\n    - In the bellator 82 row, kala hose was also knocked out by a punch.\n\n5.

His method was \"tko (punches)\" and he won, which means he wasn't knocked out in the first round.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine if both Rafael Real and Phil Collins were knock out in the first round of their match based on previous steps.\nRafael was not in the first round for his win since it said \"1st round\" but we also see that his time (1:09) is less than 3 minutes, so actually he was knocked out at the beginning.\n\n#### Step 4: Finalize the reasoning by providing a JSON response.\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the rows in the table that contain information about Rafael Real and Phil Collins.\",\n      \"text\": \"Identify the relevant cells\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Check if both Rafael Real and Phil Collins were knocked out in the first round of their respective matches.\",\n      \"text\": \"Check time for each fighter's win to confirm whether he was knocked out in the first round or not.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Determine if both Rafael Real and Phil Collins were knock out in the first round of their match based on previous steps.\",\n      \"text\": \"Confirm that one of them indeed was knocked out early\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to verify if there were any matches between Sultan Aliev and Lavar Johnson where the outcome was a decision (not a knockout or technical submission). We will check all relevant rows in the table.\n\n2. Next, we will look up the row(s) corresponding to this pair of opponents in order to determine their respective records.\n\n3. Since the claim is talking about both matches being decide by submission and not knockouts, we need to verify that there are no records of either match being won with a knockout (KO). If they were both KO wins, then the claim would be false as the outcome isn't submit.\n\n4. After verifying all steps above, if the first step shows that the match was indeed decided by submission and the second step shows the outcomes were a submission, and the third step shows no KO's in either of those matches we can confirm that the chain_of_thought is correct and provide a final answer as requested.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
