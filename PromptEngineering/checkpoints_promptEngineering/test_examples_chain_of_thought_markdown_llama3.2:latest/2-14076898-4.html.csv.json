This means that there are instances where the points are greater than 12.\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n5. **Analyzing for Less Than 2**:\n   - There is one row with a points value less than 2 (row 8), which matches the condition stated in the claim.\n   - Additionally, there are other instances where points are exactly equal to 2, which does not satisfy the \"less than\" condition but shows that the scenario of being greater than 12 has already been ruled out.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the steps above, we can conclude about the validity of the claim in relation to the table's data.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the Claim: Understand what the claim is stating about the points table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Break Down the Claim: Identify if the claim regarding never more than 12 points and only once less than 2 points holds true.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Check the Points Column: Verify that there are no instances of points being greater than 12 and only one instance of points being less than 2 in the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Analyzing for Greater Than 12: Confirm if the claim about never more than 12 points holds true based on the highest value found.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Analyzing for Less Than 2: Verify if there is indeed only one occasion where the points are less than 2 as claimed.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion: Based on previous steps, determine the validity of the claim with respect to the table's data.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Thus, this row doesn\u2019t fit our criteria for the draw condition specified in the claim.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we are only looking for occurrences where a team drew (i.e., `drawn = 1`) and there were exactly two teams with these conditions (`34 - 25` and `36 - 29`), without further detailed examination of each cell, it seems clear that the claim is true. However, we must confirm that no other matches have drawn and this goal difference.\n\n7. **Checking for Additional Matches**:\n   - Upon reviewing all rows with `games = 7`, there are indeed no other teams where a team drew (i.e., `drawn = 1`) and had either of these two specific goal differences.\n\n8. **Final Conclusion**: There is only one occurrence per condition that matches the criteria given in the claim, meaning the claim about the existence of exactly two such occurrences is accurate.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Understanding the claim and identifying relevant cells.\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim states there are only 2 occasions when a team drew (i.e., `drawn` equals 1) and had a goal difference of either `34 - 25` or `36 - 29`.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's understand the claim: We need to find three instances where the number of points is 7 and the number of losses is 3.\n2. To verify this, we'll go through each row in the table:\n   - For each game, check if the points are 7 and the losses are 3.\n   - If we find such rows, add them to our list of matches.\n3. Now let's examine the table row by row:\n\n    | games | drawn | lost | goal difference | points |\n    |-------|-------|------|------------------|---------|\n    |      7 |       0 |     1 | 51 - 10          |       12 |\n    |      7 |       0 |     1 | 40 - 13          |       12 |\n    |      7 |       0 |     2 | 41 - 19          |       10 |\n    |      7 |       1 |     3 | 34 - 25          |        7 |\n    |      7 |       1 |     3 | 36 - 29          |        7 |\n    |      7 |       0 |     4 | 32 - 27          |        6 |\n    |      7 |       0 |     6 | 17 - 68          |        2 |\n    |      7 |       0 |     7 | 11 - 71          |        0 |\n\n    Let's examine the points and losses:\n\n   The first two games have both 12 points and only 1 loss, which does not match.\n   The third game has 10 points and 2 losses, which also doesn't match.\n   In the fourth and fifth games, we see that both have 7 points with 3 losses each. Thus, these are two of our matches.\n\n    Now let's continue examining other rows:\n   - The sixth row has 6 points and 4 losses, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n   - The seventh row has 2 points and 7 losses, which also does not fit the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe found two instances where there are 3 time when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time. So we conclude that there is indeed 2 time where such case happen.\n\n\n\nHere's our final answer in a JSON format:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"The first two games do not have both 12 points and only 1 loss.\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"The third game does not fit the criteria of having 7 points with 3 losses.\"\n      ,\"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"The fourth and fifth rows match the claim, both have 7 points and 3 losses each.\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Other games do not fit the criteria, leaving us only two matches\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that there have been three occasions when a team drew, and in each of these occasions, the goal difference was either 34-25 or 36-29.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check the table for occurrences where the drawn column is '1' (indicating a draw) and the goal difference matches one of the specified values: 34-25 or 36-29.\n3. Looking at the table, we find rows with drawn = '1' and corresponding goal differences:\n   - Row 5 has drawn = '1', goal difference = 34 - 25 = 9 (does not match)\n   - Row 6 has drawn = '0', goal difference = 36 - 29 = 7 (does not match)\n   - Row 3 has drawn = '0', goal difference = 41 - 19 = 22 (does not match)\n4. However, upon reviewing the table again, we notice that row 5 actually has a goal difference of 9-25, but if we look at row 7 we have drawn = '1' and goal difference = 32 - 27 = 5 (which also doesn't match). And in row 4 we have drawn = '1' and goal difference = 34 - 25 = 9.\n   After reviewing the table I noticed that, row 4 actually has a match for both values: 34-25 and 36-29. We still need one more draw to confirm the claim as TRUE.\n5.
