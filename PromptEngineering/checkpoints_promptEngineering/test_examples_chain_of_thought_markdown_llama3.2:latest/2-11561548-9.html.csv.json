We can see in the table that there is another emulator called \"n64js\" which has an entry in the \"platform\" column as \"javascript\". Since javascript is a programming language and is also used in mobile app development, it's likely that this emulator could be used on an android device, even though it's not explicitly stated.\n4. However, we need to verify if there are indeed any other emulators listed for Android.\n5. After examining the table again, I can see no other entry besides \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" for the emulator \"nintendo 64\" that runs on Android.\n6.

Based on our analysis, we know daedalusx64 and project64 run on both Windows and Xbox. However the claim says only 3 emulator run on both window and xbox , that makes it difficult to find one more that also satisfies this condition .\n\n4. Since corn is the only other emulator besides daedalusx64 and project64 which runs on Windows but not Xbox , we still need another one that will satisfy this condition , in order to make the claim TRUE \n\n5. Now let's review the rest of the columns, license column, as it seems that most emulators are licensed with either GPL v2 or proprietary.\n   - daedalusx64 is gpl v2 licensed\n   - mupen64plus (which runs on Windows and OS X but not Xbox)  is also gpl v2 licensed\n\n6. Since both daedalusx64 and mupen64plus are gpl v2 , it can't be true that only gpl v3 used .

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify the row(s) that contain information about mupen64plus , android edition (ae)**:\nThe relevant row for mupen64plus , android edition (ae) is the one with \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" in the `name` column.\n\n2. **Check if this row indicates that it runs on Android**:\nAccording to the table, mupen64plus , android edition (ae) indeed runs on Android, as indicated by the cell value \"android\" in the `platform` column.\n\n3. **Determine if there are other rows indicating an emulator running on Android**:\nUpon reviewing the table, we find that there is another row, \"project64\", which also runs on Android, since its cell value in the `platform` column is \"xbox\". However, it's important to note that the question specifies \"Android\" as a required condition, so just having an emulator listed for Android isn't enough. It must be explicitly stated as running only on Android.\n\n4. **Check if this row indicates that it runs on JavaScript**:\nSimilarly, according to the table, mupen64plus , android edition (ae) indeed runs on JavaScript, as indicated by the cell value \"javascript\" in the `platform` column.\n\n\n5. **Determine if there are other rows indicating an emulator running on JavaScript**:\nWe can see that there is another row, \"n64js\", which also runs on JavaScript, since its cell value in the `platform` column is \"javascript\". Like with Android, just having an emulator listed for JavaScript isn't enough. It must be explicitly stated as running only on JavaScript.\n\n6. **Evaluate the claim**:\nThe claim states that mupen64plus , android edition (ae) is the only emulator that runs on both Android and JavaScript. However, we have identified other emulators (project64 and n64js) that also meet these criteria.\n\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\nBased on our analysis, the claim is FALSE because there are multiple emulators listed in the table that run on both Android and JavaScript.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n  ]\n}",
