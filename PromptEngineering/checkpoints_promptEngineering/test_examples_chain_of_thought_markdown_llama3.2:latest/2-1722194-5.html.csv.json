According to the table, both buildings have a height of 188 m/617 ft. Since they have the same height, we need to compare their heights at different times.\n\n2. Find the height of Place Ville Marie in 1964: It is given as 188 m/617 ft.\n\n3. Find the height of Tour De La Bourse in 1964: According to the table, its height in 1964 was 194 m/637 ft.\n\n4. Compare the heights of both buildings at that time:\n   - Place Ville Marie has a height of 188 m/617 ft.\n   - Tour De La Bourse has a height of 194 m/637 ft.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between their heights: \n   - Difference = Height of Tour De La Bourse in 1964 - Height of Place Ville Marie in 1964\n   - Difference = 194 m - 188 m = 6 m\n\n6. Convert the difference from meters to feet (the given unit in the claim):\n   - Difference in feet = 6 m * 3.28084 ft/m \u2248 19.62 ft\n\n7. Check if the difference is indeed a mere 6/20 m/ft:\n   - The claim states that the difference should be \"a mere 6 / 20 m / ft\". To check, we need to see if 6 m can be expressed as (6 * 1) / 20 m, which would result in approximately 0.3 m.\n   - Since 19.62 ft is greater than 0.3 m and the claim specifically says 'mere', the building that was stated to have \"a mere\" difference of 6/20m does not have the true title according to this definition.\n\n\n\nHere's a JSON answer based on our analysis:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, these are not directly related to when Place Ville-Marie lost its title as the tallest building.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the given information and focusing strictly on the claim's assertion about Tour De La Bourse being taller than Place Ville-Marie in 1964 (despite having fewer floors), we must look for evidence that supports this specific assertion. The only relevant detail is that both buildings had an equal number of floors in 1964, but the claim actually misrepresents its own statement since it does not say Place Ville-Marie lost its title because of floor count being higher, which isn't entirely incorrect given that both have 47 floors but we are looking at height for \"tallest\".\n\n7. **Final analysis**: Given the focus on \"height\" to determine \"the tallest building\", Tour De La Bourse indeed has more height than Place Ville-Marie in 1964 based solely on their respective heights provided.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

Therefore, we need to identify rows where `years as tallest` is less than or equal to 1 (since \"least amount of year\" implies the shortest duration).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the relevant row(s)\nThe relevant row for evaluation is the one corresponding to \"place ville marie\".

By inspecting the table again, we can see:\n\n| name                   | years as tallest   | of years as tallest   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|:----------------------|\n| tour cibc              | 1962               | <1 year               |\n\nIndeed, there is only one row that meets this condition. However, to confirm the claim's validity, we should also check if there are any other buildings that have been the tallest for an even shorter period (less than 1 year).\n\n### Step 6: Check for other relevant rows\nUpon closer inspection of the table, it appears that \"tour cibc\" is indeed the only building that has been the tallest for less than 1 year.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Determine if the Sun Life Building was indeed the tallest building in Montreal for 31 years, which is the same amount of time as the Notre Dame Basilica (99 years).\n2. Check if the Sun Life Building has been the tallest building in Montreal continuously for 31 years.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- From the table, we see that the Sun Life Building was the tallest building in Montreal from 1931 to 1962, which is a total of 31 years.\n- During this time, the Notre Dame Basilica was also the tallest building in Montreal for most of those years (1829-1928 and then 99 years).\n- However, we need to determine if the Sun Life Building has been the tallest building in Montreal continuously for 31 years.\n\n3. Check the status of the Sun Life Building as the current tallest building in Montreal.\n4. Since the Sun Life Building was not always the tallest building in Montreal continuously for 31 years, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
