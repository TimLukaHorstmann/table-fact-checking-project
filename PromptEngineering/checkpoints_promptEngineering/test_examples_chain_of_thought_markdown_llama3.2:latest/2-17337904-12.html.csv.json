    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim mentions the royal house being unavailable for states Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, and Yan.\n2. To verify this, we need to check if any of these states have a \"royal house\" that is actually empty (\"-\").\n3. For each state mentioned in the claim (Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, and Yan), we need to check their respective royal houses:\n   - Cao: \"cao\" -> sovereign | yi                  | count    | -\n   - Chen: \"chen\" -> sovereign | you                 | duke     | -\n   - Song: \"song\" -> sovereign | li                  | duke     | -\n   - Wey: \"wey\" -> sovereign | li                  | marquis  | -\n   - Yan: \"yan\" -> sovereign | hui                 | marquis  | -\n4. From the table, we can see that:\n   - Cao's royal house is actually occupied by a count (\"yi\"), so it's not empty.\n   - Chen's royal house is actually occupied by a duke (\"you\"), so it's not empty.\n   - Song's royal house is actually occupied by a duke (\"li\"), so it's not empty.\n   - Wey's royal house is actually occupied by a marquis (\"li\"), so it's not empty.\n   - Yan's royal house is actually occupied by a marquis (\"hui\"), so it's not empty.\n5. Since none of the states mentioned in the claim have an empty royal house, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Cao\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"Chen\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"Song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"Wey\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"Yan\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"cao\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"chen\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"wey\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"yan\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This means we need to check if the royal house for state Jin is indeed not Ji.\n\n2. Next, we look at the table to find the information about the royal house of Jin. From the table, we see that Jin has a sovereign named Jing and Xi as part of its royal house (ji). However, according to the claim, Jin's royal house should not be Ji.\n\n3. Now, let's examine if there are either Jing or Xi in state Jin's royal house. We can observe from the table that the two names appear separately under \"name\" column but together as \"ji\" under \"royal house\".\n\n4. Let's find the row index for the state Jin and its corresponding information about the royal house. The row index of Jin is 7, so we need to check if \"ji\" indeed appears as a single entry in that row.\n\n5. Now let us verify if either Jing or Xi (or both) are in Jin's royal house title . Since they appear together with Ji under the \"royal house\" column, it seems to contradict our claim. Let's assume for now that we have found this information correctly and look at what we need to do next.\n\n6. To verify if our assumption is correct, let's confirm again by looking at the table where does each person belong in Jin 's royal family . We see that \"Jing\" belongs to the royal house title of Jin as well as \"Xi\". Our claim initially said the royal house for state Jin should be Ji not ji\n\n7. Based on our previous verification, we can see from table that \"ji\" is indeed a single entry in Jin's royal house which means our assumption at step 5 was correct and according to our current findings - there should exist jing or xi but they are part of the same family so it cannot be said as separate entities for the royal house title of Jin.\n\n\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Claim: the royal house be not ji for the state jin\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Table shows Jing and Xi as part of Jin's royal house (ji)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Jing or Xi appear together with Ji under 'royal house' column\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Verify the row index for state Jin and its royal house information\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion: since both Jing and Xi are in Jin's royal house, it contradicts our claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Verification: check if each person belongs to the royal family of Jin \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion: since Jing and Xi are part of the same family, it cannot be said as separate entities for the royal house title of Jin\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"royal house\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
