    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that Greg Norman spent more than 3 times as many weeks at number 1 than Nick Faldo.\n2. **Extract relevant information from the table**:\n   - To compare Greg Norman's and Nick Faldo's performance, we need to look at their \"weeks\" column values since it represents the number of weeks they were ranked #1.\n   - Greg Norman had 331 weeks in the top 10, but this is not directly comparable without knowing how many times he was ranked #1. We need to check his \"majors\" and \"order\" columns to determine if he reached that rank at all.\n\n3. **Determine Greg Norman's performance**:\n   - Greg Norman had a total of 14 majors wins, which means he must have been ranked in the top 10 for those specific tournaments (given his ranking order is 2). However, we cannot directly confirm if he was #1 solely based on major wins without knowing his exact \"weeks\" rank.\n   - His \"order\" column indicates that he has never reached a higher position than #2. Since this is the highest position Greg Norman holds in the table and it\u2019s given as 2nd which means he must have been ranked at least for one week as number 1.\n\n4. **Calculate Nick Faldo's performance**:\n   - According to the table, Nick Faldo had 97 weeks in the top 10, but again we need to verify if he was in the #1 spot during these periods.\n   - His \"order\" column shows that he was ranked at least one time as number #4. This is lower than Greg Norman's highest rank of #2.\n\n5. **Compare performance**:\n   - We know Greg Norman had more weeks at #1 because he spent 331 weeks in the top 10 but only spent 8 weeks as number #1, so the times when he was ranked #1 are not given directly.\n   - Nick Faldo's highest rank was #4 and it\u2019s mentioned that his order is 4 which means there must have been more time he has spent in this position than Greg Norman who had a higher rank of #2.\n\nHowever the claim can be verified only if we know how many times Greg Norman spent at the top. The table does not explicitly state that Greg Norman was ranked as number one during his 331 weeks. \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on available data, the claim cannot be determined since there is insufficient information to verify whether Greg Norman indeed spent more than three times as many weeks at #1 compared to Nick Faldo.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": null},\n        {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": null},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"order\"},\n        {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": null}\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"}\n    ]\n}",
