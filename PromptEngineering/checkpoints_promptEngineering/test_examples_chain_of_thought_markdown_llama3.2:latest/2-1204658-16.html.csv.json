    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that South Melbourne scored the most points out of every team.\n2. To verify this, we need to compare the scores of each team. We will start by looking at the home team scores.\n3. From the table, we can see that South Melbourne's home team score is 18.12 (120).\n4. Next, let's look at Essendon's score. Their home team score is 17.17 (119), which is higher than South Melbourne's score.\n5. Since Essendon scored more points than South Melbourne, the claim cannot be true for the home teams.\n6. Now, we need to consider the away team scores to see if any team scored more points than South Melbourne.\n7. Looking at the table again, we can see that Carlton's away team score is 6.13 (49), which is lower than South Melbourne's score.\n8. Since no team scored more points than South Melbourne in either category, we need to look for a team with a score that is equal to or higher than South Melbourne's score.\n\nHowever, there are teams like Essendon and South Melbourne where they both have scores of 120, so the statement can be considered true for those two teams. However, considering the entire table, there isn't any instance where South Melbourne scored more points than every other team.\n\n\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"South Melbourne score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Essendon score\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"South Melbourne score\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Essendon score\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. The first step is to check if there is a record of every game being played on 8 August 1908. This can be done by checking each row in the table to see if the date matches.\n2. Check each row individually:\n\t* Row 1: fitzroy - home team score, university - away team score, match date is 8 August 1908 (matches)\n\t* Row 2: essendon - home team score, melbourne - away team score, match date is 8 August 1908 (matches)\n\t* Row 3: collingwood - home team score, st kilda - away team score, match date is 8 August 1908 (matches)\n\t* Row 4: south melbourne - home team score, richmond - away team score, match date is 8 August 1908 (matches)\n\t* Row 5: geelong - home team score, carlton - away team score, match date is 8 August 1908 (matches)\n3. Since all rows have the same match date of 8 August 1908, it can be concluded that all games were played on this date.\n4.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that no team score more than 120 point in a game. To verify this, we need to check if there is any row in the table where the home team's score or the away team's score is greater than 120.\n\n2. We will start by examining the scores for each team in each game.\n   - In the first game between fitzroy and university, neither team scored more than 120 points (fitzroy: 94, university: 73).\n   - In the second game between essendon and melbourne, essendon's score is higher than 120 points (119). This row could be relevant to our claim.\n   - We will continue checking the rest of the rows in the table.\n\n3. Moving on from the second step, we have already identified a single row that contradicts the claim: \"essendon        | 17.17 (119)       | melbourne   | 8.11 (59)         | emcg                  | 8 august 1908 \".\n   - We now need to determine if there are other rows where a team scored more than 120 points.\n\n4. Continuing from the third step, let's examine the remaining rows.\n   - In the third game between collingwood and st kilda, collingwood's score is less than 120 points (70).\n   - In the fourth game between south melbourne and richmond, south melbourne's score is more than 120 points (120). This row could be relevant to our claim.\n   - We will continue checking the rest of the rows in the table.\n\n5. Moving on from the fourth step, we have found two more rows that contradict the claim: \"south melbourne | 18.12 (120)       | richmond    | 4.4 (28)          | lake oval             | 8 august 1908 \" and \"fitzroy         | 13.16 (94)        | university  | 11.7 (73)         | brunswick street oval | 8 august 1908 \".\n   - Now that we have found more than one row where a team scored more than 120 points, our claim is false.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Extract relevant scores from the table\nWe need to extract the scores for South Melbourne, Richmond, and Carlton to compare them.\n\n- For South Melbourne: 18.12 (120)\n- For Richmond: 4.4 (28)\n- For Carlton: 6.13 (49)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extracting relevant scores from the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"South Melbourne score: 18.12 (120)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Richmond score: 4.4 (28)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Carlton score: 6.13 (49)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the combined Richmond and Carlton score\nTo determine if South Melbourne scored less than the combined Richmond and Carlton score, we need to add their scores.\n\n- Combined Richmond and Carlton score: 4.4 (28) + 6.13 (49) = 10.57 (77)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculating the combined Richmond and Carlton score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Combined Richmond and Carlton score: 10.57 (77)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare South Melbourne's score with the combined Richmond and Carlton score\nNow we compare the scores to determine if South Melbourne scored less than the combined Richmond and Carlton score.\n\n- Since 120 is greater than 77, South Melbourne scored more points than the combined Richmond and Carlton score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing South Melbourne's score with the combined Richmond and Carlton score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"South Melbourne's score (120) is greater than the combined Richmond and Carlton score (77)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is: {\"chain_of_thought\": [...], \"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [...]}\n\nNote that the output is in the required JSON format.",
