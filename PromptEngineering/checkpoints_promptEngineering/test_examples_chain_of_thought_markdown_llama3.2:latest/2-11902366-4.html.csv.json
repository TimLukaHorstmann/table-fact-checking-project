To verify this, I need to check if there is an entry in the table with \"date\" = \"november 17\", \"home\" = \"new jersey\", and \"visitor\" = \"philadelphia\".\n3. Since this entry exists, I will then check the attendance column for this date to confirm it matches the crowd of 19621.\n4. If both conditions are met, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let me explain my steps in detail:\n\n- Step 1: Given that the table contains records for each game played by New Jersey, we must first identify the relevant date and team match-up to verify if there is an entry with \"date\" = \"november 17\", \"home\" = \"new jersey\", and \"visitor\" = \"philadelphia\". \n- Step 2: Upon locating such a match-up (Step 1), I will look for an entry in the attendance column corresponding to this date. If this entry equals 19621, then the claim is correct; if not, it's incorrect.\n- Step 3: The attendance cell with \"row_index\" = 17 and \"column_name\" = \"attendance\" contains the value \"19621\". \n- Step 4: Since this matches our required condition, we know that on November 17, New Jersey played Philadelphia for a crowd of 19621.

However, we are not looking for games without spectators to have scores.\n   - **November 21**: Attendance is 17132; no issue.\n   - **November 23**: Attendance is 18545; no issue.\n   - **November 24**: Attendance is 19077; no issue.\n   - **November 28**: Attendance is 13665; this indicates a game with zero spectators, which means at least one score was present because the team played.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there's only one instance in the table where New Jersey Devils had zero attendance (indicating no spectators), and this instance happened during a game that still had scores, we conclude that the claim is actually false.

Now I need to verify if these instances were indeed shutout games where the opposing team did not score any points. This requires checking the \"score\" column for rows with a count of 0 and ensuring that there is an instance in the row before or after each such row where the opponent's score was counted as 0.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Continued...\n\n1. After reviewing, I found instances fitting this criterion:\n   - November 12: 'pittsburgh' is a shutout with a count of 0 (score) and New Jersey won.\n   - November 16: 'ny islanders' is not a shutout since they scored one point; it does have a score of 0 for the opposing team, but that's incorrect based on my initial analysis. Let's correct this oversight.\n   - November 17: 'philadelphia' is indeed a shutout with no points scored by the opponent and New Jersey won.\n   - November 21: 'pittsburgh' is not a shutout since they scored two points; again, this is incorrect based on my initial analysis. Let's correct this oversight as well.\n   - November 23: 'atlanta' does have an instance with zero opposing team score but was incorrect in the context of New Jersey winning without them scoring. My error upon re-evaluation indicates it fits after correction that there isn't a shutout that matches the claim.\n\n2. Correcting my previous analysis, to fulfill the condition of being a shutout game for the New Jersey Devils and losing:\n   - The instance on November 12 with 'pittsburgh' does indeed meet this criterion as New Jersey won without Pittsburgh scoring.\n   - The instance on November 17 with 'philadelphia' also meets the criterion since Philadelphia did not score.\n\n3. Upon re-evaluation, I realized my initial oversight in accurately identifying shutout games that match the criteria. Given this correction and understanding of what constitutes a shutout game where the opposing team does not score:\n   - It appears there are instances in row 12 and row 17 where New Jersey Devils won without their opponents scoring. These are indeed shutout wins for the Devils.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on my analysis, I found two instances that meet the criteria of being a shutout game where the opposing team did not score any points during the games.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identified a shutout game according to the table.\",\n    \"Found rows with New Jersey Devils not scoring any points (i.e., 'score' column has only 0).\",\n    \"Checked if these games were indeed losses for the New Jersey Devils by looking at the 'decision' column.
