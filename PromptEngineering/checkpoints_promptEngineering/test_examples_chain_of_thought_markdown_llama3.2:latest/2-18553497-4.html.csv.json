We need to verify if this claim is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Gamal Hamza's Performance\nFrom the table, we can see that Gamal Hamza scored in two events: \"caf champions league\" (with a score of 2) and \"egyptian premier league\" (with a score of 1). Therefore, Gamal Hamza has participated in more than one event.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Junior Agogo's Performance\nFrom the table, we can see that Junior Agogo scored in two events as well: \"caf champions league\" (with a score of 1) and \"egyptian premier league\" (with a score of 3). Therefore, Junior Agogo has also participated in more than one event.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if Any Other Players Have Scored in More Than One Event\nAfter verifying Gamal Hamza's and Junior Agogo's performances, we need to check if any other players have scored in more than one event. The table shows that there are no other players with scores greater than 1 in different events.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the Truth of the Claim\nBased on our analysis, it appears that Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are indeed the only players to score in more than one event.\n\n#### Step 6: Output Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Analyze Gamal Hamza's performance\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Analyze Junior Agogo's performance\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Check if any other player has scored in more than one event\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This will give us the total number of players who have scored at least one goal in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of players who have never scored a goal in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nTo do this, we count the rows where the value in the \"egyptian premier league\" column is zero. We will use the total count from Step 1 to determine if Amr el-Safty is indeed one of only two players to not score in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\n### Step 3: Check if Amr el-Safty has scored a goal in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nLooking at the table, we see that Amr el-Safty's value in the \"egyptian premier league\" column is zero. This means he indeed did not score any goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\n### Step 4: Check if there are only two players who have never scored a goal in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nFrom our count in Step 2, we know that Amr el-Safty is one of them (because his value was zero). We then need to verify that there's exactly one more such player on the list. To do this, we can compare our current total to the table values - particularly examining if any other row matches these exact '0's in egyptian premier league and if there's another zero among them.\n\n### Step 5: Verify if there is indeed only two players with no Egyptian Premier League goals\n\nAfter re-examining the data, we see Amr el-Safty has a unique situation because his row (alongside others) contains '0's in egyptian premier league and egypt cup columns. Upon closer inspection of other rows that also have '0' values in their respective columns, most notably excluding those with 1 or more goals - there isn't another player to match this exact zero count across both the egyptian premier league and egypt cup columns.\n\n\n\n### Step 6: Conclude based on our analysis.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can now make a determination about the claim. The table does show Amr el-Safty as having no goals in Egyptian Premier League but also reveals no other player to match exactly this \"0\" count among both egyptian premier league and egypt cup values.\n\n\n\n### Step 7: Compile all information into our output.\n\nHere's what we've found:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1.

The relevant cells for this are:\n```\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Find the number of goals scored by Sabry Raheel\nFrom the table, we can see that Sabry Raheel's total is 1.

Since both numbers are less than 4, let's also check their difference in more detail.\n\n### Step 5: Check if there is a possibility for an error due to rounding.\nGiven that both values are integers and no further information can be used to infer any rounding errors, we conclude there is no possibility of them being exactly 4 apart with such small numbers.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the claim\nBased on our calculations and checks, we find that Shikabala scored 3 goals and Sabry Raheel scored 1 goal.
