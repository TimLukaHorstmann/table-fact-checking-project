    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the opponents of Librado Andrade who have been defeated by Lucian Bute.\n\nTo verify if the claim is true, we need to determine which fights between Lucian Bute and other opponents were lost by Librado Andrade. First, let's list all the rows from the table where Lucian Bute is either the opponent or had a win/loss against him:\n\n| row_index | column_name         |\n|-----------|:---------------------|\n| 12        | opponent             |\n| 13        | opponent             |\n| 14        | opponent             |\n| 9         | opponent             |\n\n### Step 2: List all opponents of Librado Andrade.\n\nNext, we need to identify the total number of opponents that Librado Andrade fought against:\n\n| row_index | column_name         |\n|-----------|:---------------------|\n| 1         | opponent             |\n| 6          | opponent             |\n| 10         | opponent             |\n| ...        | ...                  |\n\nWe will only consider rows where the \"opponent\" column contains one of these values.\n\n### Step 3: Identify fights where Librado Andrade lost to Lucian Bute or won against him.\n\nLooking at the table, we can see that in two cases Librado andrade fought lucian bute, so we need to confirm that he won in both cases. In addition, since only 5 of these fights resulted in loss for librado andrade, our next task is to count how many times this happens.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of losses of Librado Andrade against Lucian Bute\n\nLooking at the table we see that there are two rows where lucian bute is an opponent. In both cases, librado andrade has a loss or draw (in one case).\n\n### Step 5: Determine how many times this has happened in total to other opponents of librado andrade.\n\nSince there are only 5 losses we need to verify if they all share the same pattern with lucian bute. In order to do that, we'll look at every fight of librado andrade (other than the ones against lucian bute) to count how many of them also have a similar result.\n\n### Step 6: Output a final answer\n\nAfter verifying our findings by counting all the relevant fights, we can provide a final answer.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

We will look for rows where both Librado Andrade and Paul Jones are mentioned as opponents.\n\n### Step 2: Search for the relevant rows in the table\nWe can do this by examining the table and identifying which row contains both names. This step requires a visual inspection of the table, but it is essential to accurately determine which fights involved both fighters.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of wins or losses against Paul Jones\nOnce we have identified all relevant rows that involve Librado Andrade and Paul Jones as opponents, we need to count how many times each had a win or loss. A win for Librado Andrade is considered True and a loss is False.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if Librado Andrade won all fights against Paul Jones\nBased on the count from step 3, if Librado Andrade has an equal number of wins to losses against Paul Jones, then he would have lost at least one fight. However, since the question claims that Librado Andrade \"wins\" against Paul Jones every time they face each other, we must find out if there is even a single loss.\n\n### Step 5: Finalize answer\nWe will conclude whether or not the claim about Librado Andrade winning all his fights against Paul Jones is True or False based on our findings from steps 3 and 4.\n\n### Reasoning Steps Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify rows for relevant opponents\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Inspect table to find matching rows for Librado Andrade vs Paul Jones\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{ \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"\" }, { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"\" }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Count wins and losses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if Librado Andrade won all fights against Paul Jones based on win-loss count\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{ \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"\" }, { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"\" }]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is: \n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify rows for relevant opponents\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Inspect table to find matching rows for Librado Andrade vs Paul Jones\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{ \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"\" }, { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"\" }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Count wins and losses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if Librado Andrade won all fights against Paul Jones based on win-loss count\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{ \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"\" }, { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"\" }]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
