    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the opponent for each game**: In order to compare the scores, we need to know which team the Baltimore Colts are playing against on both Nov 11th and Nov 25th.\n   - On Nov 11th, the Baltimore Colts are playing against the Miami Dolphins (Game #11).\n   - On Nov 25th, the Baltimore Colts are playing against the Miami Dolphins (Game #13).\n\n2. **Extract scores for each game**: We need to extract the scores scored by the Baltimore Colts in both games.\n   - For Game #11 on Nov 11th, the score is 19 points.\n   - For Game #13 on Nov 25th, the score is 28 points.\n\n3. **Compare scores**: Compare the scores from both games to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n   - On Nov 11th, the Baltimore Colts scored more than the Dolphins (19 vs 7).\n   - On Nov 25th, the Baltimore Colts scored less than their previous game against the same opponent (28 vs 24).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the Baltimore Colts did not score more on Nov 25th than they did on Nov 11th, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"dolphin points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"dolphin points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
