Finally, I need to check if both games were against \"oriole\".\n   However, neither the first game nor the last game has \"orioles\" as an opponent.\n\n4.

Determine what we need to find:\n\t* The game(s) with the lowest attendance.\n\t* If any of these games are played against the Athletics.\n3. Look at the table and find the columns relevant to our task:\n\t* `attendance` for attendance information\n\t* `opponent` for the team the game was against\n4. Find rows with the minimum attendance value, which is 21418 in the case of June 22's game:\n\t* The row for June 22 has an attendance of 21418.\n5. Check the opponent for this attendance value to see if it's the Athletics:\n\t* According to the table, on June 22, the opponent was indeed \"athletics\"\n6.
