    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim about the venue used by Evansville teams is true, we need to analyze each team's information in the table.\n2. We notice that there are multiple teams (Evansville Vipers, Bluecats, Express, and Tri-State Titans) playing football at the Goebel Soccer Complex, which suggests that it has been used as a venue for several teams.\n3. Next, we need to find out how many teams use the Goebel Soccer Complex, so we can compare this number with the total count of other venues used by Evansville teams.\n4. We look at each team's information: \n   - The Vipers and Express only play at the Goebel complex (in 2 different periods).\n   - The Bluecats also have a venue listed as \"Robert's Municipal Stadium\", which is not relevant to our question about Goebel Soccer Complex.\n   - The Titans only played there for one year, so that is also less than two.\n5. We then need to look at the Ohio River Bearcats' information because it has an additional piece of information (the title won in 2008). Their stadium, Reitz Bowl, doesn't match our search criteria.\n6. Since only three teams exclusively used Goebel Soccer Complex for their football games out of the given Evansville teams, we find that there are more than just a couple but also less than four venues used by these teams (as there were five).\n7. The final step is to confirm if any team(s) use other venue(s), which would make the claim false. In this case, we know that none of the given Evansville football teams have won championships at their respective stadiums.\n8. Now that we know more than one but less than four venues were used and each one has a corresponding year for it (in 2000-2007 for Goebel), it appears to be less than three different venues.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"played\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the relevant information for the claim: The claim states that the Bosse Field was used as the most used venue. We need to check if this is true by comparing the number of years each team played at their respective venues.\n\n2. Compare the number of years each team played at their respective venues:\n- The Evansville Crimson Giants played only 1 year (1921-1922) at Bosse Field.\n- The Evansville Vipers, Bluecats, and Express played a total of 7 years (2000-2005, 2003-2007, and 2004-2005 respectively) at Goebel Soccer Complex, which is more than the number of years played by the Crimson Giants.\n- The Tri-State Titans also played only 1 year (2008-2009) at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n- The Ohio River Bearcats played for 3 years (2008-2010) at Reitz Bowl.\n\n3. Determine if Bosse Field was used as the most used venue based on the information: Since none of the teams played more than one year at Bosse Field, and some teams played only a single game there, we can conclude that this is not the statement in question; however, it does say \"be use\" which means to be used by or employed for. Therefore it says that the field is being used by the most amount of teams.\n\n4. Determine if the amount of years played was relevant enough: Since each team had only one year at the field they could not have used more than any other field. We must look elsewhere, so we are looking to see how many total seasons were played there in comparison to Goebel Soccer Complex.\n\n5. Look at Goebel soccer complex and count the number of years that the teams played:\n- The Evansville Vipers played 7 years (2000-2007)\n- The Evansville Bluecats played 4 years (2003-2007)\n- The Evansville Express played 1 year (2004-2005) which is less than the vipers\n- The Tri-State Titans played for 2 years (2008-2009) which is also less than the number of years that the vipers played\n\n6. Determine if Goebel Soccer Complex was used as much or more than Bosse Field:\nSince none of the teams played more than one year at Goebel soccer complex, this means they could not have been the most used.\n\n7.

This period overlaps with the time frame of Robert's Municipal Stadium (2003-2007).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of this date range and that at Bosse Field (1921-1922), it is clear there are no teams with overlapping dates during these periods playing both venues.\n\n### Step 5: Make a judgment\nSince Evansville Bluecats played from 2003 to 2007, which overlaps with the time frame of Robert's Municipal Stadium but not the other way around (because Evansville Crimson Giants were only active between 1921-1922 and this period is before Evansville Bluecats' start year), we must conclude that Evansville Crimson Giants could be playing at the Bosse Field before Evansville Bluecats took over the venue.\n\n### Step 6: Output JSON\nHere's the final answer in the requested format:\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify events\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine which team plays at each venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Look up relationship between Evansville Crimson Giants and Evansville Bluecats\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Check if any team is playing between these dates\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Make a judgment\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote: I am only able to do so for the final JSON format.",

Look at the team names for any indications of duplication or uniqueness.\n3. Determine which columns contain relevant information about the claim.\n\n### Relevance Columns:\n\n* `team` column: contains all unique team names\n* `played` column: irrelevant to determining the truth of the claim\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. Check if there are more than two teams with the word \"evansville\" in their name.\n   - Look at each row and check for the presence of \"evansville\".\n   - Evansville Crimson Giants, Evansville Vipers, Evansville Bluecats, Evansville Express, Tri-State Titans, and Ohio River Bearcats all have the word \"evansville\".\n\n2. Since there are more than two teams with the word \"evansville\", check if any of them appear to be duplicates or if their team names suggest that they are part of the same entity.\n   - Evansville Crimson Giants, Evansville Vipers, and Evansville Bluecats all seem unique based on the provided information.\n\n3. Now examine other words besides \"evansville\" in team names for potential duplication:\n   - Tri-State Titans has a different first word than any team name containing 'evansville'. This suggests that there are at least two distinct teams (with different names).  Ohio River Bearcats does not appear to share the same first word.\n\n4. Verify the conclusion drawn from these observations about duplicate vs non-duplicate entities:\n   - The presence of Evansville Crimson Giants, Evansville Vipers, and Evansville Bluecats indicates there is indeed more than two teams named with \"evansville\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Check for the word evansville in team names\",\n      \"column\": [\"team\", \"played\"],\n      \"row_index\": [0,2]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Determine which team members have unique names vs non-unique names\",\n      \"column\": [\"team\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}",

Check if the sport of the evansville vipers is football.\n3. Check if the played period of the evansville vipers starts before 2008 (since that's when the ohio river bearcats started playing).\n4. Check if any championship won by the team has a venue mentioned as goebel soccer complex.\n\nLet's evaluate each step:\n\n1. The table confirms that the sport of the evansville vipers is indeed football.\n2. The played period of the evansville vipers starts in 2000, which is before 2008. This means they have played after 2007 but before 2008.\n3. However, there is a note about \"gmfl title 2008\" under the team \"ohio river bearcats\", and it does not indicate if the evansville vipers won this championship.
