Next, we need to analyze the claim \"300sel be the only model with 2 different engine\". This implies that there should be at least two models in the table with different engines.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that there are indeed four rows for the \"300sel\" model: w109.015, w109.016, w109.018, and w109.056. However, none of these rows have a different engine type compared to each other.\n4. On the other hand, we observe that row 1 (w109.015) has an engine type of \"3.0l m189 i6\", while row 5 (w109.057) has an engine type of \"4.5l m117 v8\". These two engines are indeed different from each other.\n5. Furthermore, we notice that there is another pair of rows with different engine types: w109.015 and w109.018 have \"3.0l m189 i6\" and \"6.3l m100 v8\", respectively, and w109.016 has a different engine type (\"2.8l m130 i6\") compared to w109.015.\n6.
