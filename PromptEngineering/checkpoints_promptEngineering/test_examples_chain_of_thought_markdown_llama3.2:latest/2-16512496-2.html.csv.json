    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the races**: First, we need to identify which races are part of the 1989 Australian Tour Car Championship. This requires looking at the \"date\" column and checking if each date falls within the year 1989.\n\n2. **Check dates for 1989**: We will compare each race's date with the start and end dates of the championship year to determine which races are included in the championship.\n\n3. **Count the wins**: Once we have identified the correct races, we need to count how many races Dick Johnson Racing won. This involves looking at the \"winner\" column for each race.\n\n4. **Compare win count to total races**: After counting the number of races Dick Johnson Racing won, we will compare this number to the total number of races in the championship.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on our findings from steps 1-4, we can determine if the claim about Dick Johnson Racing winning 6 out of the 8 races in the 1989 Australian Tour Car Championship is true or false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nEach relevant cell will contain \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".

Count how many races Dick Johnson Racing won during the championship.\n\n4. Check if the count from step 3 matches the total number of races in the championship (i.e., 8).\n\n5.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. The claim states that both Sandown and Winton races take place on the same date.\n2. We need to verify this by comparing the dates of both races in the table.\n\nRelevant cells:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"date\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"column_name\": \"date\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n3. The date for the Sandown race is listed as `21 may` in row index 5, and the date for the Winton race is listed as `4 june` in row index 8.\n\nSince these two dates are different (`21 may` vs `4 june`), we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Compare dates of Sandown and Winton races\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Verify that both races do not take place on the same date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
