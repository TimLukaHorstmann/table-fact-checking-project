    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the average per capita income for all counties in New Mexico.\n2. We can do this by summing up all the values in the \"per capita income\" column (excluding the United States row) and dividing by the number of rows in that column (which is 16).\n3. The value in the \"per capita income\" column for the United States is $27334. Since there are only two states in New Mexico, we don't need to include this value in our average.\n4. Now, let's calculate the average per capita income for all counties in New Mexico.\n5. We sum up the values in the \"per capita income\" column: 49474 + 32188 + ... + 12932 = 1417672\n6. There are 16 rows in the \"per capita income\" column, so we divide the sum by 16 to get the average:\n   $1417672 / 16 = 88687.\n7. Now that we know the average per capita income for all counties in New Mexico, let's check if Los Alamos and Santa Fe have higher incomes than this average.\n8. Los Alamos has a per capita income of $49474, which is less than the average ($88687). Therefore, it cannot be one of the two counties with a higher per capita income than the average for the United States.\n9. Santa Fe has a per capita income of $32188, which is also less than the average ($88687).\n10. Based on steps 8 and 9, we can see that neither Los Alamos nor Santa Fe meets the criteria of having a higher per capita income than the average for the United States.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: We need to calculate the average per capita income for all counties in New Mexico.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Calculate the sum of values in the 'per capita income' column\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Divide the sum by the number of rows in the 'per capita income' column to get the average\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 4: Check if Los Alamos and Santa Fe have higher incomes than this average\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 5: Based on steps 3 and 4, neither Los Alamos nor Santa Fe meets the criteria\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"per capita income\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"per capita income\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"per capita income\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the number of households in each county**: \n   - Look at the table for both de Baca and Harding counties to find the number of households.\n   - For de Baca, it is stated as 912.\n   - For Harding, it is stated as 349.\n\n2. **Check if the number of households in Harding county matches exactly with 1000**:\n   - Compare the value of the \"number of households\" for Harding (349) with 1000.\n   - Since Harding has fewer than 1000 households, this does not match the claim.\n\n3. **Check if the number of households in de Baca county matches exactly with 1000**:\n   - Compare the value of the \"number of households\" for de Baca (912) with 1000.\n   - Since de Baca has fewer than 1000 households, this also does not match the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Both Harding and de Baca have fewer than 1000 household in total. However, none is equal to exactly 1000.\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Counting households in each county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Checking Harding's number of households against the claim of 1000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Checking de Baca's number of households against the claim of 1000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion: neither county matches exactly 1000 households\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"number_of_households\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"number_of_households\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
