Looking at the table, we can see that on February 27, the score was Minnesota - Tampa Bay with a final score of \"3 - 2\".\n\n### Step 3: Checking Score for February 29\nNext, we need to check if the score on February 29 is also \"3 - 2\". According to the table, the score on February 29 was indeed Minnesota - Florida with a final score of \"3 - 2\".\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Attendance\nThe claim does not mention attendance for both dates. Since we verified that the scores are the same but did not check attendance, this should be considered as part of the evidence needed to support or refute the claim.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on our findings, we can confirm that the score was the same on February 27 and February 29 during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision was Harding more time than it was Backstrom.\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant columns\nTo verify the claim, we need to identify which columns contain the necessary information. The \"decision\" column indicates who made the decision and when, while the \"home\" column shows where the game was played. We also need to examine the attendance numbers for each game.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze attendance patterns\nBy looking at the attendance numbers in each row of the table, we can identify if one goalie (Harding or Backstrom) has more appearances in games with higher attendance than the other.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze the attendance pattern of the Minnesota Wild during the 2007-08 season\",\n    \"Check which goalie appears in games with lower attendance compared to games with higher attendance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compare attendance with decision\nWe need to compare the attendance number in each game with the column indicating who made the decision (Harding or Backstrom).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"...\",\n    \"Compare the attendance number with the 'decision' column to determine if one goalie appears more often in games with lower attendance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Determine which goalie appears more often in lower attendance games\nAfter examining the attendance numbers and decision columns, we need to determine if Harding or Backstrom appear more frequently in games with lower attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"...\",\n    \"Examine rows where attendance is higher than average\",\n    \"Harding appears only once with high attendance (february 10), whereas Backstrom appears three times.\",\n    \"Based on this observation, determine if the decision to be Harding more time than it be Backstrom is TRUE or FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Output the final answer\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE. Here's the complete JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze the attendance pattern of the Minnesota Wild during the 2007-08 season\",\n    \"Check which goalie appears in games with lower attendance compared to games with higher attendance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the column to compare home and away games**: The decision column contains information about whether the game was played at home or away for Minnesota.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of games played at home and away**: To verify if Minnesota played more games at home than they did away, we need to know how many times they were classified as playing at home versus away in the \"decision\" column.\n\n3. **Extract relevant data from table**:\n    - For \"home\", this will be the number of times 'backstrom' was listed as 'columbus', 'st louis', 'edmonton', 'vancouver', or 'chicago'. \n        Relevant cells for home = [{row_index: 1, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 10, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 12, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 14, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 15, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 20, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 24, column_name: \"decision\"}]\n    - For \"away\", this will be the number of times 'backstrom' was listed as 'ny islanders', 'dallas', 'nashville', or 'tampa bay'. \n        Relevant cells for away = [{row_index: 3, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 5, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 17, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 19, column_name: \"decision\"}, {row_index: 21, column_name: \"decision\"}]\n\n4. **Compare total home games to total away games**: If the number of relevant \"home\" cells is greater than the number of relevant \"away\" cells, then the claim that Minnesota played at home more times than they played away during the 2007 - 08 season can be verified.\n\n5. **Verify if the attendance for home and away games was provided**:\n    - The attendance information in the table may not be necessary to verify the claim about playing at home versus away, but it does provide a way to understand whether the team played more of their games to larger or smaller crowds. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Conclusion\nSince we are only tasked with determining if Minnesota played more games at home than they did away and not specifically how many games were played to what attendance (except that such information doesn't appear to impact our decision directly), let's analyze the \"home\" and \"away\" data from the table:\n- Relevant \"home\" cells = 7\n- Relevant \"away\" cells = 5\n\n Minnesota therefore played more home games than they did away during the 2007 - 08 season.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify column to compare\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Determine total number of games played at home and away\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Extract relevant data from table\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 10,\n          \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 12,\n          \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 14,\n          \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 15,\n          \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 20,\n          \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 24,\n          \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare total home games to total away games\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"home_games\": 7\n        },\n        {\n          \"away_games\": 5\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
