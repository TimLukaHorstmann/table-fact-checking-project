    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the picks for Albert Butts and Cliff Webber in the table.\n   - For Albert Butts, look at the 5th row of the table: row_index = 5, column_name = \"pick\". The value is 116. So, Albert Butts was draft pick #116.\n   - For Cliff Webber, look at the 4th row of the table: row_index = 4, column_name = \"pick\". The value is 93. So, Cliff Webber was draft pick #93.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the position of Albert Butts' pick (#116) after Cliff Webber's pick (#93).\n   - Since there are no picks between 93 and 116 in the table (the next highest number is 139), we can say that Albert Butts was draft pick #116 after Cliff Webber.\n\n3. Now, let's verify if this order holds true for a given year of the draft.\n   - The claim mentions the year \"1985\", so we need to find out what round and pick numbers corresponded to that year in the table.\n   - There is no direct information on which picks came first in the 1985 draft. However, we can look at the row numbers for each player (round) since players with lower round numbers tend to be picked after those with higher ones.\n\n4.

We need to focus on the `pick` column to find the drafted player.\n\n3. **Find players from Rutgers**: In the table, we see that Chris Remly played for Rutgers (row 7). We also notice that there is no direct information about the school or club team of a player picked at number 2 overall in row 6.\n\n4. **Check for year-specific information**: The claim mentions 1985, but we don't have any direct evidence linking a specific player to this date.\n\n5. **Look for an indirect match**: Given that Chris Remly was picked by the Boston Celtics and played for Rutgers, we should investigate if he matches the criteria of being drafted at number 2 overall in 1985.\n\n6. **Verify Chris Remly's draft information**: Unfortunately, without additional data or context about the specific year and draft pick numbers, it is challenging to confirm whether Chris Remly was indeed drafted by the Boston Celtics as a number two overall selection in 1985. However, based on available information, we cannot confirm the claim directly.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The provided table does not offer direct evidence that supports the claim about the specific player from Rutgers being selected by the Boston Celtics at number 2 overall in 1985. While Chris Remly was picked by the Celtics and attended Rutgers, there is no clear indication of whether he met all other specified criteria.\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"school/club team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"school/club team\"}\n  ]\n}",
