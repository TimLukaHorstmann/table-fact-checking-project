    "resp": "Here are the steps for determining whether the claim about Michael Young being drafted from Houston by Celtic in 1984 is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to check if there was a player named \"Michael Young\" who was drafted by the Celtics in 1984. This can be done by checking if the table contains an entry with \"player\" = \"michael young\", \"round\" >= 1, and \"pick\" < 90 (since draft picks are usually numbered from 1 to 90). The reason for this cutoff is that if a player was drafted in round 1 or 2, it's likely they were picked by the Celtics.\n\n   - Relevant cell: Row_index=1, column_name=\"player\"\n\n2. Next, we need to check what college \"Michael Young\" attended. This can be done by checking if the table contains an entry with \"player\" = \"michael young\", \"college\" != null, and \"college\" = \"houston\". If this condition is met, then Michael Young did attend Houston.\n\n   - Relevant cell: Row_index=1, column_name=\"college\"\n\n3. Finally, we can verify that the claim states Michael Young was drafted by Celtic from \"Houston\". Since there is no indication of which team drafted whom in the given table, we need to look elsewhere or use additional data. In this case, I will assume that since the question mentions Celtic Draft, it must refer to a draft involving them.\n\n   - Relevant cell: Not directly mentioned in the prompt\n\nNow, using these steps:\n\n- Step 1 and 2 do not match because Michael Young's college was not \"Houston\".\n\nSince we are unable to verify the claim due to missing information regarding which team drafted whom from \"houston\", our process has been compromised.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check if player named Michael Young exists in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check college of player named Michael Young\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the relevant information: The claim states that a single draft pick by the Celtic in 1984 has a first name starting with the letter 'r'. We need to find the corresponding row in the table.\n\n2. Look for the year \"1984\" in the table: Since there is no column specifically mentioning the year, we'll assume it's related to the round number. The rounds are consecutive integers starting from 1.\n\n3. Find the draft pick by the Celtic in the relevant round: We will check if any player picked by the Celtics was selected in a round that matches \"1984\" (which could be round 24 since 1984 is not present but 24 is).\n\n4. Check the first name for the matching pick: Once we find the correct draft pick, we need to verify if its first name starts with the letter 'r'.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The relevant row index from the table is 24 (for round 1) because it's where Michael Young was picked by the Celtics.\n- No other information about a Celtic player in \"1984\" is found. However, we know Michael Young was selected in that pick.\n- We can confirm Michael Young's first name starts with 'M', not 'R'.\n- Therefore, since no match to our claim exists and none of the relevant data matches the criteria specified by our claim,  the chain of thought leads us away from \"TRUE\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The draft pick at row index 24 in the table does not meet the stated condition regarding its first name. No other matching picks were found that match the 'r' initial requirement.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
