After re-reading the table and claim, I found a possible match: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9.

To verify this, we need to look at the table for Canon Yaound\u00e9's matches.\n\n2. **Locate Canon Yaound\u00e9's match in the table**: We need to find Canon Yaound\u00e9's row in the table and identify their opponents.\n\n3. **Check Canon Yaound\u00e9's scores against each opponent**:\n   - Against \"Lavori Publici\", Canon Yaound\u00e9 scored 9 points with no loss (2-0).\n   - No other relevant matches are mentioned for Canon Yaound\u00e9.\n\n4. **Determine if any of these scores were zero**: The score 0 is not present in Canon Yaound\u00e9's record against Lavori Publici, but we must check to ensure there was no other match where they scored zero points or lost by zero points.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on the analysis**: Since Canon Yaound\u00e9 did not lose any matches with a score of zero, and no zero-point loss is mentioned in their records, it can be concluded that Canon Yaound\u00e9 never scored against an opponent by zero point.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the relevant information\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim about Canon Yaound\u00e9 is related to their score against an opponent.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate Canon Yaound\u00e9's match in the table\",\n      \"description\": \"We need to find Canon Yaound\u00e9's row in the table and identify their opponents.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check Canon Yaound\u00e9's scores against each opponent\",\n      \"description\": \"We need to find out if any of these matches resulted in a score of zero points for Canon Yaound\u00e9.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if any of these scores were zero\",\n      \"description\": \"Verify that no zero-point loss is mentioned in their records.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion based on the analysis\",\n      \"description\": \"Canon Yaound\u00e9 never scored against an opponent by zero point.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}",
