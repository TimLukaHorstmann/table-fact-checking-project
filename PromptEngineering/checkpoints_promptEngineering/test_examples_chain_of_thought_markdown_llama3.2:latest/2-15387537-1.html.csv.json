Since there's no evidence of any other season mentioned in the table, let's assume it refers to the current or previous season.\n\nAccording to the table:\n- Corinthian has a \"difference\" column that represents the number of points above or below their opponents' score.\n- Br\u00e1s has a \"difference\" value of -17.\n\nThis means that Br\u00e1s is behind Corinthian by 17 points.

Look up the number of games lost by br\u00e1s in the table: The difference between \"played\" and \"lost\" for br\u00e1s in column 5 is -9 (since the difference represents how many more goals br\u00e1s scored than they conceded), but this does not seem to be what the question asks, so we'll look at the \"against\" column instead. Since this is about games lost, let's assume that it refers to the number of goals the team conceded.\n3. Find the row with br\u00e1s: br\u00e1s has a row index of 7 and its position in the table is 7\n4. Compare the number of games lost by br\u00e1s (found in step 2) with the minimum value found in column 5, which represents the total amount of points conceded:\n- The difference between \"played\" and \"lost\" for each team does not give us the answer we're looking for, so let's look at the \"against\" column. Column 5 actually represents the number of points conceded by br\u00e1s.\n    - The value in row 7, column 5 is 41\n- The minimum value found in column 5 (points conceded) that we have to compare with is: \n      - For row 1, column 5 has a difference of 23; for row 2, column 5 has a difference of 16; for row 3, column 5 has a difference of 10; for row 4, column 5 has a difference of 15; for row 5, column 5 has a difference of 5; for row 6, column 5 has a difference of 3.\n    - Since the value in column 5 represents points conceded and we're interested in \"games lost\", we'll need to look at the number of games played instead. The formula for finding the number of games lost is the same as that for the difference: it's equal to (points conceded) - (points). In our case, this will be represented by (41 - x), where x is the points scored.\n    - We need to find the row with the minimum value in column 5 so we can compare the value of (41-x) with that of other rows. \n      - The difference between \"played\" and \"lost\" for each team does not give us the answer we're looking for, so let's look at the table again. Since this is about games lost, let's assume that it refers to the number of goals the team conceded.\n      - Column 5 actually represents points conceded by br\u00e1s.\n    - To find the row with the minimum value in column 5 (points conceded), we can sort the values in column 5 for br\u00e1s. The sorted list is: [8, 15, 20, 22, 23, 25, 41] \n    - Now that we have our values, let's find the row with the minimum value.\n      - Row 7 has a difference of 41 in column 5 (points conceded), which is not the smallest number found. The row with the smallest number will be the one at index 0 because it represents the team with the most points conceded and therefore also the one that has lost the most amount of games.\n    - Row 7's value in column 5 is 41\n      - Row 1's difference is 23 (25-2) = 23; row 2's difference is 16 (23-7); row 3's difference is 10 (22-12); row 4's difference is 15 (21-6); row 5's difference is 5 (20-15); row 6's difference is 3 (17-14); row 8 has a value of 8.\n      - The smallest number found in column 5 that we have to compare with is: 8\n4. Compare the number of games lost by br\u00e1s (found in step 2) with the minimum value found in column 5, which represents points conceded:\n    - The difference between \"played\" and \"lost\" for br\u00e1s is indeed -17.\n    - The formula to calculate the number of games won is: games_won = games_played - points_lost\n        - If we look at column 5 (points conceded) instead, it would be x = 41. So the formula would be: games_lost = games_played - x where x is the points conceded.\n        - Using this formula for br\u00e1s gives us: \n            - games_lost = games_played - 41\n              - If we look at column 5 (points conceded), the value for br\u00e1s is indeed 8, but it's not clear what that represents in terms of games lost. Looking back to step 1, we see that this must be points conceded. However, in order to find the number of games won, we need to know how many points br\u00e1s has scored.\n              - Using column 5 (points conceded) for br\u00e1s: \n                - games_played = 16\n                - x = 8\n                - The formula is:\n                  - games_lost = games_played - x\n                    - Substituting in our values, we get:\n                      - games_lost = 16 - 8\n                        - This gives us: games_lost = 8\n          However, if we look at column 5 (points conceded) instead of column 4 (points), the value for br\u00e1s is indeed 41. Looking back to step 1, this must represent the points conceded by br\u00e1s.\n              - Using column 5 (points conceded) for br\u00e1s: \n                - games_played = 16\n                - x = 41\n                - The formula is:\n                  - games_lost = games_played - x\n                    - Substituting in our values, we get:\n                      - games_lost = 16 - 41\n                        - This gives us: games_lost = -25\n      - If we substitute the value of games_played and points_conceded into our formula for finding games lost (i.e. (played) - x where x is the number of points conceded), we'll get:\n        - (-17) \u2260 8\n5.

To do so, let's look for any teams with a value higher than 25.\n\n### Table Snippet:\n|   position | team          |   points |   played |   drawn |   lost |   against | difference   |\n|-----------:|:--------------|---------:|---------:|--------:|-------:|----------:|:-------------|\n|          1 | corinthians   |       25 |       17 |       1 |      4 |        23 | 23           |\n|          2 | paulistano    |       23 |       17 |       3 |      4 |        15 | 16           |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe table does contain another team, Paulistano (with 23 points), who has more than the threshold. This means Corinthian is not the only team to have scored over 25 points; they share this position.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
