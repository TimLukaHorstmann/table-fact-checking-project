    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to verify the claim made about Ned Grabavoy and Tony Beltran.\n2. For Ned Grabavoy, we look at his \"goals\" column in the table (column #5) which is 8, not less than 8.\n3. For Tony Beltran, we also look at his \"goals\" column which has an unknown value because it's \"0\".\n4. We need to find out if there is a missing number of goals for Tony Beltran from the table and compare it with 5.\n5. Looking at the table again, Tony Beltran's goals are indeed listed as 0 in two rows (rows #7 and column header).\n6. Given that goal count for any player is only recorded once per table entry, we must find some other information about Tony Beltran from the table to determine his actual number of goals.\n7. Looking at row #7 of the table, it reads \"tony beltran     | usa      |    135 |       0 | 2008 - present\"\n8. We can see that there is indeed a missing value (number of goals) in row #7 which must be recorded somewhere else, however according to row #7, his number of goals is recorded as 0.\n9. If we look again at column header \"goals\" we find the same answer: The player with id tony beltran has no goals listed.\n10. We can see that this is not a correct answer because it contradicts the original statement about Tony Beltran having more than 5 goals and less than 8 goals.\n\nLet's now make the final judgment of whether or not the initial claim made is true or false:\n\n11. Given our research, we know Ned Grabavoy has 8 goals (not less than 8) while Tony Beltran has no recorded number of goals which does seem to be less than 5 according to the table's data.\n12. So based on these findings, we can determine that the claim \"player ned grabavoy from the usa have less than 8 goal while player tony beltran have 5 goal\" is TRUE.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 8,\n            \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
