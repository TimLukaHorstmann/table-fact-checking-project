Since there are actually **4** players tied at rank **4**, the actual 2nd place is determined by checking who among these four has a better or worse score than Billy's score, which we have confirmed to be true (i.e., a worse one).\n\n#### Step 6: Determine relevant cells\nThe relevant cells for this claim are:\n- `row_index=1` and `column_name='score'`\n- `row_index=2` and `column_name='score'`\n\nTherefore, our final answer will look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Determine the total number of players from the United States\",\n    \"Find the second highest finish player from the United States using those calculated numbers.\",\n    \"Check scores to see if Billy Kratzert being the second highest finish player is indeed true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output in JSON format answers the question of whether Billy Kratzert being the second highest finish player from the United States is indeed TRUE or FALSE.",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim is about a player from Japan being 3 strokes back from Seve Ballesteros.\n2. We need to find the score of Seve Ballesteros and compare it with the scores of Japanese players in the table.\n3. According to the table, Seve Ballesteros's total score is 139 (71 + 68).\n4. Now, let's look at the Japanese players:\n   - Tsuneyuki Nakajima has a total score of 139 (70 + 71), which is equal to Seve Ballesteros's total score.\n   - Since we are looking for being 3 strokes back, we need to check if any other Japanese player is scoring higher than Tsuneyuki Nakajima and at least 3 strokes behind Seve Ballesteros.  \n5. There is no player in the table that scores higher than Tsuneyuki Nakajima, so he cannot be 3 strokes back from Seve Ballesteros.\n6. However we need to look if any Japanese players are scoring lower that 139-3=136\n7. Only one Japanese player Corey Pavin is scoring at a score of 143 which is lower than the required number.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start by looking at Seve Ballesteros's total score and comparing it with the scores of Japanese players. Tsuneyuki Nakajima has an equal score, so he cannot be 3 strokes back. Then we look for any player scoring lower than required number which would indicate they are 3 strokes behind. Only one Japanese player Corey Pavin is scoring at a score of 143 which is lower than the required number\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
