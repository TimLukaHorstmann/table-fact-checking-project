Next, we should check if there are any other materials with a higher amount of polyunsaturated fat than 3 g.\n   - The values in the \"polyunsaturated fat\" column for each material are as follows:\n     - suet: 3 g\n     - rice bran oil: 37 g\n     - peanut oil: 32 g\n     - corn oil: 55 g\n\n3. From these comparisons, it is clear that there are other materials with more polyunsaturated fat than suet.\n\n4. Since the claim is saying that \"suet has the highest gram of polyunsaturated fat out of any material\", which is not true based on our findings above, we can conclude the claim to be false.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"corn oil\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"peanut oil\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"suet\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"polyunsaturated fat\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"corn oil\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"peanut oil\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"suet\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
