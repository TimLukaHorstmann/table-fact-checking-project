We need to identify where these values are present in the table.\n\n   - Score 4 points: This appears in cells with \"points\" value equal to 4.\n   - Score 0 point: This appears in cells with \"points\" value equal to 0.\n\n2. **Locate instances of score 4 and 0 points**: We need to find rows where the \"points\" column has a value of 4 and another row (or rows) where the \"points\" column has a value of 0.\n\n   - Rows with \"points\" = 4: \n     - Row index 5, Column name: points\n     - Row index 7, Column name: points\n     - Row index 11, Column name: points\n   - Rows with \"points\" = 0:\n     - Row index 1, Column name: points\n     - Row index 2, Column name: points (appears twice)\n\n3. **Determine the time difference**: The claim states that a score of 4 points occurs less than once for every score of 0 point. This requires identifying if there are instances where you can divide the number of rows with \"points\" = 4 by the number of rows with \"points\" = 0, and if this division is less than 1.\n\n   - Count of rows with \"points\" = 4: There are three such instances (5, 7, and 11).\n   - Count of rows with \"points\" = 0: There are two such instances (1 and 2).\n\n4. **Calculate the ratio and check if less than 1**: If we divide the count of rows where score is 4 by the count of rows where score is 0, we can determine if this ratio is indeed less than 1.\n\n   - Since there are 3 instances of a score of 4 points and only 2 distinct instances of a score of 0 point (considering the duplicate), dividing 3 by 2 gives us 1.5, which is not strictly less than 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Given that the ratio of scores 4 to scores 0 does not meet the criteria of being less than 1, we can infer that the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, let's extract the required information from the table:\n   - In 1983, team arrows racing team scored 4 points.\n   - In 1986, barclay arrows bmw scored 0 points.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine if Marc Surer scored twice as many points in 1986 than he did in 1983.\n   - We know that Marc Surer drove for Team Arrows (the same team mentioned in the claim about 1983) in both 1986 and 1983.\n\n3. Now, we need to verify if Marc Surer scored twice as many points in 1986 than he did in 1983:\n   - In 1983, he scored 4 points.\n   - In 1986, barclay arrows bmw (the team Marc Surer drove for) scored 0 points.\n\n4. Based on the information above, it seems unlikely that Marc Surer scored twice as many points in 1986 than he did in 1983. Let's confirm this by looking at the individual scores for Marc Surer:\n   - However, we can't find any direct evidence of Marc Surer's scores in either year.\n\n5. Given the lack of information on Marc Surer's individual scores and considering the team scores provided in the table, it is difficult to definitively answer the claim with absolute certainty based solely on this data.\n   - But let's assume we can't verify that the individual score for 1986 matches the statement exactly but Team Arrows did have a lower total score that year.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on our analysis, without direct information about Marc Surer's scores in both years, it is challenging to definitively answer the claim.

    "resp": "Step 1: Understand the claim\nThe claim states that Marc Surer scored 6 points and that he scored at least twice (2 times) fewer points than his highest score.\n\nStep 2: Extract relevant information from the table\nWe need to find Marc Surer's scores in the given years. Looking at the table, we can see that he drove for Ensign and Arrows teams.\n- In 1979, he scored 0 points.\n- In 1981, he scored 4 points.\n\nStep 3: Determine if Marc Surer met the condition\nSince his highest score was 4 points in 1981, let's verify how many times that is less than or equal to his overall total of 6 points. Since no other year has a higher score than this we can check by comparing total 6 with any other years score.\nHowever if he had more, then he would need at least one instance where that number was twice as high and then the next two points scored were also below him lowest.\n\nStep 4: Compare scores\nGiven that 6 is not twice as high as 4. It does not meet the condition of having at least 2 times his highest score which is 4.\nBut 5/6 = 0.833 and 3 / 4 = 0.75 so it also doesn't exceed twice.\n\nStep 5: Analyze if statement can be true\nIf we only look at total points that he scored then yes this statement seems to be false because the lowest score was half of the highest. However, given the way the statement is written and comparing it with other years for comparison we need to verify whether he can have a single year where his highest was 6 (and higher) thus meeting that aspect.\nStep 6: Look at his overall total\nHowever no instance has been found where he had more than one 6. He could also have a single score of 12 if the conditions were met. \n\nBut looking further down he does indeed meet those criteria in year 1985 - total 11\n\nThus, for this statement to be true there needs to be at least two more instances like that.\n\nStep 7: Check if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nSince Marc Surer's highest score was 6 points, which is twice his lowest score of 3 points, and also had a year where he scored 11 (twice 6) we can say that the statement \"Marc Surer score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total\" is FALSE\n\nStep 8: List relevant cells\n- Cell | row_index | column_name\n- Ensign N179 | 1979 | engine\n- ats d4 | 1980 | chassis\n- ensign n180b | 1981 | entrant\n- Theodore Ty01 | 1981 | chassis\n- arrows a6 | 1983 | chassis\n- BMW Str - 4 t / c | 1984 | engine\n- brabham bt54 | 1985 | chassis \n- arrows a8 | 1986 | chassis",

Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in three races during 1982.\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed 'arrows racing team' entries in 1982; found two instances where points were scored but with different amounts (3 and 1), thus unable to confirm that Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in three races during 1982.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points in his 4 races in 1982.\n2. First, let's look at the relevant column for \"points\" which is on row_index 2 and column_name \"points\".\n3. We can see that there are two entries on this row: \"team ats\" with chassis \"ats d3\" and engine \"cosworth v8\", and \"team ats\" with chassis \"ats d4\" and engine \"cosworth v8\". Both of these entries have 0 points.\n4. Next, we look at the entry for \"arrows racing team\" on row_index 2 with chassis \"arrows a4\" and engine \"cosworth v8\", which has 3 points.\n5. Then, there's another entry for \"arrows racing team\" on row_index 2 with chassis \"arrows a5\" and engine \"cosworth v8\", also having 3 points. This adds up to a total of 6 points so far from this one team alone (since it has two entries in the same year).\n6. However, there's no other entry that matches Marc Surer, which can score 9 points in 4 races in 1982.\n7. We should check that we've looked at all relevant data - but we have seen all entries for 1982 for every team (bar a couple of rows with the same entry). So we're sure there are no other race teams contributing to scores.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"arrows racing team points\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
