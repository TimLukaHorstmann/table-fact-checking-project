    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states that Vasselin fought hard to win all 5 games. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding because the table only contains data for five tennis matches, not a single match with 5 games.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Table Data\nLooking at the table, we can see that each row represents a different tournament match. There are no rows that indicate a single match played over 5 games. \n\n### Step 3: Verify Each Row for More Than One Game\nHowever, to verify if Vasselin fought hard in any of these matches, let's examine if any match has more than two games. Upon examining the data:\n- In the first row (27 june 2005), both players won in straight sets (6-4 and 6-4).\n- In the second row (14 march 2010), a player retired during one of their matches (6-7, 6-3, 1-0) but did not play all five games due to retirement.\n- In the third row (12 september 2010), both players also won in straight sets (6-3, 6-7(8-10), 6-7(6-8)).\n- In the fourth row (17 july 2011) and fifth row (11 september 2011), we can see that all matches were won by Vasselin but again only in two games.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Relevance of Each Cell\nSince none of the provided data contains a match where both players played more than one game, and thus no data supports \"all 5 games\" for any player to fight hard, there's an error in how the question was posed. However, we can still state that according to the information given, the claim as stated is FALSE because Vasselin did not participate in a match lasting over two games.\n\n### Step 5: Compile Answer\nWe have determined through logical analysis that the claim provided does not align with any data available for the player Vasselin. Thus we cannot verify if Vasselin fought hard to win \"all 5 games\" as the premise of the question is flawed based on the table's content.\n\n### Step 6: Format Response\nBased on our findings and explanation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'Vasselin fought hard to win all 5 games' cannot be determined TRUE or FALSE due to an error in question premise. The data does not support any match lasting over two games, thus making the statement about fighting hard for all 5 games impossible according to the given table.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"None\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"None\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Note:\nGiven that there's no direct match data available for a player named Vasselin in the table and that the initial claim seems to have been constructed with an error regarding the number of games (assuming it meant more than two games), our analysis concludes as per the step-by-step process laid out.",
