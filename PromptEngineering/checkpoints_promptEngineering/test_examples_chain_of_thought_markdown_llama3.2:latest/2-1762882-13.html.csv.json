    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the competition column**: The claim mentions a specific competition, but we need to identify it from the table.\n   - Looking at the \"competition\" column, we see that it is not consistently named throughout (e.g., \"ecqg5\", \"ecqpo\"). However, one of the competitions, \"ecqpo\", appears in multiple matches.\n\n2. **Determine the match where Scotland won**: According to the claim, Scotland holds their competition 0 point 4 time. We need to find out which match this refers to.\n   - From the table, we see that Scotland won 1-0 against \"ecqpo\" at Hampden Park on both November 11th and March 31st.\n\n3. **Check if other matches have more points**: Since a single win isn't enough, let's check if there are any matches with scores 0-4 or higher.\n   - Looking through the table again, we see that none of the matches result in a score 0-4 or higher. The closest is Hampden Park (h) on September 6th with a score of 3-1 and another match on November 11th with a score of 1-0.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on our analysis, Scotland won exactly one competition 0 point 4 time, which was against \"ecqpo\".

However the opposing team scored more goals than goals scored by Scotland's opponent so there was a loss, but since it wasn't in competition, friendly league games were not being played that day, so no.\n\n    k. **Re-examine the claim and matches where scores of 0 - x did occur**: For score \"0-6\" this game was for ecqpo and for score \"1-2\" this also seems to be part of an ecqg5 game with a loss. For the rest no evidence exists.\n\n    l. **Analyze how many times zero points were scored**:\n        Scotland's only true zero-point match is likely *none*. But we have some where scores are 0 - x. These seem to be a mix of wins/losses but since they weren't in any competition, then no.\n\n4. **Draw the conclusion**: Since there is no information that suggests that all matches that had a score starting with \"0\" were part of the 2003 - 04 scottish football season (as we can see, scores like this are most likely to be for friendly league games in which points weren't awarded), and since none show evidence of ecqg5 or any other competition where points could have been scored, then it's possible that *zero points were not scored* in the 2003 - 04 scottish football season.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: The claim states that Scotland scored 0 points 3 times during the 2003 - 04 Scottish football season.\",\n      \"conclusion\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Locate relevant information for each match to find if Scotland scored zero points.\",\n      \"conclusion\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3a.

Looking at the table, there are four instances where Scotland played at Hampden Park: \n   * 6 september\n   * 11 october\n   * 15 november\n   * 31 march\n3. Next, we need to determine how many times Scotland played at Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo.\n4. Looking at the table again, there is only one instance where Scotland played at Ullevaal Stadium: \n   * 20 august\n5. Now that we know the number of times Scotland played at both Hampden Park and Ullevaal Stadium, we can compare these numbers to determine if the claim is true or false.\n6. To do this, let's count how many times Scotland played at Hampden Park:\n\t* We have 4 instances in total (as listed above)\n\t* And then we need to account for another match that was missing from our initial list: \n      * 27 may\n7. Now that we know the number of times Scotland played at Hampden Park is actually 5, let's compare this to the number of times they played at Ullevaal Stadium.\n8. We know that Scotland played only once at Ullevaal Stadium (as listed above).\n9. Since 5 (number of times Scotland played at Hampden Park) is greater than 1 (number of times Scotland played at Ullevaal Stadium), we can conclude that the claim \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland play at hampden park , glasgow 3 more time than they do ullevaal stadium , oslo\" is false.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In the table, there are two columns with names that seem relevant (ecqg5 and ecqpo). The claim mentions \"2003 - scottish football season glasgow hold their competition back 4 time\" without specifying the exact competition name. However, based on the context of \"scottish football season\", it is reasonable to assume that the column representing this information could be one of these two.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine which column represents \"friendly\" and \"ecqg5/ecqpo\" competitions\nLooking at the table, we can see that the \"friendly\" label appears in columns \"score\" for matches played on the same day as the venue (ullevaal stadium , oslo (a)), parken stadium , copenhagen (a), hampden park , glasgow (h). However, this does not help us directly identify which column is ecqg5 or ecqpo. But we do see that in September and October, there are two matches labeled as \"ecqg5\" played at Hampden Park (first one 6 september  and the second one 11 october), so it seems reasonable to assume that \"ecqg5\" is indeed the name of the competition being referred to by the claim.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify relevant cells\nBased on our findings in steps 1-2, we can list the relevant cells as follows:\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if Glasgow held their competition back four times\nNow that we have identified the relevant cells, let's analyze the data. The claim is about Glasgow holding their competition (identified as ecqg5) back four times during the 2003 - scottish football season. We can see from the table that there are two matches in October where Glasgow won with a score of 1-0 and then lost to 0-6 at Amsterdam Arena. Since we know that in September, Glasgow also won against 3-1 against Dortmund (away), it seems unlikely that they would lose on their \"home\" ground. However, looking at other matches for this competition (ecqg5), we can see that the total goals scored by Glasgow throughout the season were higher than what was expected if they had won every match by more than 4 goals.\n\n#### Step 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on our analysis, it seems plausible that Glasgow may not have held their competition back four times as suggested by the claim.",

We need to check the table for any matches played by Scotland at Amsterdam during this time period.\n3. Looking at the table, we see that one of the matches was on November 19, 2003 (report: \"ecqpo\"), with a score of 0 - 6.\n4. However, the claim mentions playing at Amsterdam \"2 times\".\n5. To verify this, we need to check if there is another match played by Scotland at Amsterdam during the same time period.\n6. Upon reviewing the table again, we see that there is no other match played by Scotland at Amsterdam during the 2003- Scottish football season.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
