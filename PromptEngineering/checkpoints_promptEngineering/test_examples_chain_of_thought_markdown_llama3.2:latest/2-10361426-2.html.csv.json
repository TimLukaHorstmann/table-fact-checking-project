    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that the largest attendance was on September 16, 1973.\n2. **Locate the relevant cells**: We need to find the row corresponding to September 16, 1973, and compare its attendance with other rows.\n3. **Find the row for September 16, 1973**: Look at the table and find the row where `week` equals 1, because week 1 is referred to as \"september 16 , 1973\".\n4. **Extract relevant data**: In this row (row_index = 1), the attendance is given in cell |   attendance | with value 44818.\n5. **Compare with other rows**: Compare this attendance value with other rows where it might be larger, particularly those for October and November games which have higher values due to their later dates.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n6. **Check October game attendance**: Look at the row corresponding to October 14, 1973, as this is another significant date with high attendance.\n   * Extract relevant data: In this row (row_index = 5), the attendance is given in cell |   attendance | with value 56438.\n7. **Compare with November game attendance**: Look at the row corresponding to November 4, 1973, as this also has a potential for higher attendance due to its early date in November.\n   * Extract relevant data: In this row (row_index = 8), the attendance is given in cell |   attendance | with value 46722.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Since we have found that both October and November games have higher attendance values than September, the claim that \"the largest attendance was on september 16 , 1973\" can be assessed against these findings.\n9. **Answer**: Because there are attendance figures larger in both October (56438) and November (46722) compared to the attendance of September 16 (44818), the statement must be FALSE.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"Recognize that the largest attendance was on September 16, 1973.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate the relevant cells\",\n      \"description\": \"Find rows for September 16, October 14, and November 4, as these are comparison points for attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the row for September 16, 1973\",\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract relevant data\",\n      \"value\": 44818\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check October game attendance\",\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract relevant data\",\n      \"value\": 56438\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check November game attendance\",\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract relevant data\",\n      \"value\": 46722\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The 'attendance' column contains the following values:\n- 44818\n- 52035\n- 48176\n- 49549\n- 56438\n- 47478\n- 47787\n- 46722\n- 47911\n- 56519\n- 46430\n- 57859\n- 53830\n- 70041\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the smallest value in the 'attendance' column\nComparing the values, we find that the smallest attendance is actually 44818.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the claim\nThe claim states that the smallest attendance be 56438. Since 44818 is less than 56438, the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Step 5: Identify relevant cells for JSON output\nThe relevant cells are those containing the values mentioned in the claim:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Final answer\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the claim to be evaluated, found all values in the 'attendance' column, determined the smallest value which is less than 56438, evaluated the claim based on this finding.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
