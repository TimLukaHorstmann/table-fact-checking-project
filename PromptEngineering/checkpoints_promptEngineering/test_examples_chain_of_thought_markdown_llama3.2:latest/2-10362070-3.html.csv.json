We see that week number 1 is associated with the date \"september 4 , 1988\". So we know that the event occurred on September 4, 1988.\n\n\n#### Step 2:\nWe find that the opponent \"Detroit Lions\" appears in the table for this date. The attendance value for this match was 76783.\n\nNext step will be checking if there are any other events with higher attendance values than 76783 in the entire table:\n\n\n#### Step 3:\nWe can verify by scanning all rows of the table for other dates and opponent names to check if there is any event that had a larger number of attendees.\n\n\nAfter analyzing every row in the given markdown table we find that no date has an attendance value higher than 76783. Hence, the claim \"attendance be highest at 76783 on september 4 , 1988 with opponent detroit lion\" can be classified as TRUE.\n\nHere is our final answer:\n\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_index\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"We know that September 4, 1988 corresponds to week number 1 in the table.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the opponent for each game to determine if Green Bay Packers are opponents two times\nTo verify the claim, we need to find the opponent of the Green Bay Packers in the table.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the opponent information for week 15\nLooking at row 15 of the table, we can see that the opponent for week 15 is indeed \"green bay packers\".\n\n#### Step 3: Compare with September 4, 1988 claim and verify if Green Bay Packers played as an opponent two times\nNow we need to check another time when green bay was the opponent. The first game is indeed on \"september 4 , 1988\" but there must be other opponents as well.\n\n#### Step 4: Locate the opponent information for week 7, 10, and 13 and verify if Green Bay Packers played as an opponent two times\nChecking row 7 of the table, we can see that the opponent for week 7 is indeed \"green bay packers\". Checking row 10, we also see that the opponent is \"green bay packers\". But row 13 shows that the opponents are not greenbay packers. So now only 2 instances are left.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify if the Green Bay Packers played as an opponent two times\nWe have already verified that the Green Bay Packers were the opponents in week 7 and 10, so they must be correct.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the opponent for each game to determine if Green Bay Packers are opponents two times\",\n    \"Locate the opponent information for week 15\",\n    \"Compare with September 4, 1988 claim and verify if Green Bay Packers played as an opponent two times\",\n    \"Locate the opponent information for week 7, 10, and 13 and verify if Green Bay Packers played as an opponent two times\",\n    \"Verify if the Green Bay Packers played as an opponent two times\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
