However, none are directly listed.\n\n4. **Verify Second Lowest Col**:\n   - Since the lowest possible value from the table (gelai peak) is higher than 10, there must be a lower value in elevation(m). Checking again, mulanje massif has an elevation of 3002, which exceeds 10, further confirming our assumption.\n\n5. **Check Second Highest Col**:\n   - For col(m) being 1642: Looking through the table, loolmalassin\u2019s col with an elevation of 3682 is higher than 1642.\n   - Upon closer inspection, we see that kimhandu has an elevation of 2653, and while it's below 1642, there isn't a direct second highest value directly above or equal to 1642 from the given data.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we verified there is no col(m) with an elevation(m) exactly at or just above 10, but did find values that could potentially fit the criteria for the \"second lowest\" if considering strictly below 10 (though none are directly listed), and because the claim requires direct equality or being 'just above' a certain value to be considered true, we need to re-evaluate our understanding of the \"least\" and \"highest\" in terms of actual values given.\n\n7. **Corrected Understanding**: The statement might seem incorrect if strictly interpreted as requiring a value 'exactly at 10' for the lowest col. Given the data provided and typical usage of such terms, it\u2019s reasonable to consider a direct comparison or proximity as part of what makes the claim true, especially since \"least\" often implies \"among all\" which in this context seems somewhat ambiguous given our table doesn\u2019t provide a lower value than 10.\n\n8. **Answer Based on Interpretation**: Given the constraints and typical language usage around \"least\" and \"highest\", there\u2019s an issue with directly applying these terms without considering the full scope of the question or further clarification about how these terms are being used here.\n\n9. **Conclusion Revisited**: Since we\u2019ve determined that our interpretation might not strictly align with traditional mathematical definitions due to a lack of data fitting certain criteria perfectly as described, and given that we must follow instructions for format strictly without deviating into explanations beyond the provided output format:\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step-by-step analysis led to an interpretation issue with the claim's direct application to table values, primarily due to a lack of direct equality or proximity for certain values as described.

However, we need to verify if this meets the criteria of being the \"tallest\" mountain.\n\nStep 3: Determine if Mount Namuli's elevation is indeed the tallest for Mozambique.\n\nFrom the given table, there are no other peaks from Mozambique with a higher elevation than mount namuli (2419m). Since elevation and prominence are both used to measure height, it can be inferred that mount namuli has the highest elevation of all Mozambican peaks listed in the table.\n\n\nStep 4: Check if any other mountain is taller or has the same elevation as Mount Namuli.\n\nComparing with other mountains, we find that none have a higher elevation. Hence, we conclude that mount namuli is indeed the tallest peak for Mozambique on this list.\n\n\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\":1,\"description\":\"check if there are more than one peak listed in Mozambique\"},\n    {\"step\":2,\"description\":\"Verify Mount Namuli information\"},\n    {\"step\":3,\"description\":\"Check if mount namuli is the tallest among all the peaks for Mozambique\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\":\"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\":\"prominence (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":11,\"column_name\":\"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\":16,\"column_name\":\"prominence (m)\"}\n  ]\n}",
