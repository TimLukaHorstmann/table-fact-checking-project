To verify this, we need to check if there are exactly 4 rows in the table where the opponent of the Toronto Blue Jays is the Mariners.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we find the following rows:\n   - Row 1: `mariners` as the opponent\n   - Row 23: `mariners` as the opponent\n   - Row 24: `mariners` as the opponent\n   - Row 25: `athletics` is not a Blue Jays opponent, it's an Athletics one\n\n3.

We can start by looking at the columns for each game:\n   - `date` column shows the dates of the games.\n   - `opponent` column indicates which team played against whom.\n   - `score` column contains the final scores of each game, but we are not interested in this information directly for our claim check.\n4.

Count how many of these confirmed instances match our claim of 5 times.\n\n### Finding Relevant Data:\n\nLooking at the table, we can see several games involving the Mariners:\n- April 4: Blue Jays played Mariners with score 3-2 (10)\n- April 5: Blue Jays played Mariners with score 13-5\n- April 7: Blue Jays played Mariners with score 3-1\n- April 8: Blue Jays played Mariners with score 4-3\n- April 23: Blue Jays played Mariners with score 8-5\n- April 24: Blue Jays played Mariners with score 4-2\n\n### Checking for Consistency:\n\nFor each of these games, the other teams involved are consistent with our claim (Mariners as opponents and no indication of a different team playing on those specific dates):\n- April 4, May 1, July 23: There was no game between Blue Jays and Mariners in this timeframe that would conflict.\n- April 5: Consistent.\n- April 7: Consistent.\n- April 8: Consistent.\n- April 23: Consistent.\n- April 24: Consistent.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on our analysis, the claim seems to be TRUE because there are indeed at least six confirmed instances of the Toronto Blue Jays playing the Seattle Mariners:\n1.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Locate the team mentioned in the claim\nTo determine if Toronto Blue Jays play Royals on April 26, we first need to find out which team plays whom. The claim mentions \"toronto blue jay\" playing against \"royals\".\n\n### Step 2: Search for a game between these two teams on April 26\nWe look at the table and check each row to see if there's a match on April 26.\n\n### Step 3: Review relevant games played before April 26 and after April 27\nSince some schedules were postponed, we should also consider any other games played in the same week or later but still within the same month that could be relevant to this question. However, our search is limited by the table entries which do not extend beyond April 30.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if there's a match between Toronto Blue Jays and Royals on April 26\nAfter reviewing the table, we find no direct entry for this matchup.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze any post-ponements affecting schedule\nGiven the \"postponed\" entries in some schedules but also noting that the actual game was rescheduled to later dates (July 23 for the Royals vs Blue Jays matchup on April 29), it is clear these postponements did not impact our ability to verify if the original claim occurred.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven no scheduled entry found in the table for this specific matchup, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim mentions Toronto Blue Jays playing Royals on April 26.\",\n    \"A search of the table did not find any record of a game between these two teams on this date.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis concludes our reasoning and provides the final answer based on the table's information.",

Check if there is any information about the Toronto Blue Jays playing on April 29.\n\nLooking at the table, we see that there is a row for the Athletics team on April 29. There is no row for the Blue Jays.\n\n2. Check if there are any postponed games in the Athletics or Rangers rows.\n\nThere are two postponed games: one for the Athletics (rescheduled for July 23) and another for the Rangers (rescheduled for May 1). However, these do not affect the outcome of this specific claim.\n\n3. Since we have already determined that there is no information about the Blue Jays playing on April 29, our reasoning process is complete.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check the table for any games played on April 29.\n\n   Looking at the table, we find a game scheduled for April 29: \"royals     | 6 - 0                                    | saberhagen (1 - 1)                       | 18194                                    | 13 - 9                                   |\"\n\n2. Check if there is any game played between Blue Jays and Angels on April 29.\n\n   Since the game against Angels is listed as postponed (rain) rescheduled for July 23, we can conclude that no game was played between Blue Jays and Angels on April 29.\n\n3. Based on steps 1 and 2, evaluate if the claim \"toronto blue jay play angel on april 29\" is true or false.\n\n   Given that there's no record of a game played between Toronto Blue Jays and Angels on April 29 because it was postponed (rain), we can confidently say this claim is FALSE.\n\n4.
