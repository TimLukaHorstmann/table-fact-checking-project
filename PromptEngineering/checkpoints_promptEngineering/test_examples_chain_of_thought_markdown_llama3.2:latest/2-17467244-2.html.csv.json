    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that Tisha Venturini played 4 matches at Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.\n2. To verify this, we need to look for the row in the table where the match is \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\", and then check if Tisha Venturini played in any of these matches at Gavle.\n3. Let's first find the relevant rows: The row with the date \"1995 - 06 - 13\" is at index 4 (row_index = 4) for the match \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\". However, Tisha Venturini did not play in this match.\n4. Then we can move on to the next row with date \"1995 - 06 - 13\", which is at index 3 (row_index = 3) for the same match. Here it says that there was a substitution at minute 80, but Tisha Venturini played at this match.\n5. The claim seems to be true. So next we need to verify whether she indeed played in four matches at Gavle.\n\n6. Looking up rows with \"gavle\" and \"1995 - 06 - 13\", then there are only two other players, but Tisha Venturini also was part of these games.\n7. Therefore the claim seems to be true.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"match\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"match\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}",

The first match mentioned in the claim (1995-06-06) has a result of \"3-3\", which means it did end in a draw. We mark this as true.\n3. Next, we check the second match mentioned in the claim (1996-07-25), but since the table only shows matches for women's football tournaments from 1995 onwards and 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup is mentioned separately in row 13 with an exact date not matching the claimed date of '25', this match might be incorrect.\n4. Since we don't have enough information on other matches to confirm or deny the draw, let's proceed to check the third match mentioned in the claim (1999-07-10). The result is \"0-0\", indicating it also ended in a draw. This makes our chain of thought complete.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null, // Since we couldn't verify the second match due to an error in date or information\n      \"column_name\": \"relevant_cells\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

For Component 1, the relevant date matches exactly with its location: `sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final` (line 1).\n   - For Component 2, the relevant match and competition match exactly but the relevant location does not match: `atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament` (line 12), where it should be `sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final`.\n   - For Component 3, there is a match in the format of the others with the correct competition but the location is different: `usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup` does not match (it needs to match \"final\" which means either \"quarter-final\", \"semi-final\", or \"gold medal match\").\n   - There seems to be an inconsistency since the other matches are in a format that refers directly to their final competitions.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the inconsistencies, especially with `atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament` and Component 3 (which does not fully fit due to location), the claim \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final atlanta 1996 olympic women ' s football tournament usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\" cannot be verified accurately.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"match\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\",\n      \"value\": \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\",\n      \"value\": \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"inconsistent_data\": true\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps for determining whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The claim seems to be referring to the \"date\" column, specifically a date in the format of \"YYYY - MM - DD\".\n\n2. **Look up the row index**: Since the claim mentions \"athens , ga\", we need to find the row index that corresponds to this location.\n\n3. **Find the match**: After searching through the table, we can see that there is indeed a match for Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament at location \"Atlanta\".\n\n4. **Check the date format**: The claim has the date in the format of \"YYYY - MM - DD\", while the actual dates in the table are in the format of \"MM - DD - YYYY\". To compare, we need to rearrange the dates.\n\n5. **Compare the dates**: Converting the claim's date \"1996 - 08 - 01\" to the correct format gives us \"08 - 01 - 1996\".\n\n6. **Check the result and competition**: According to the table, on August 1st, 1996, at location Atlanta, USA played a match against what? The claim is asking about \"start 2 - 1 gold medal match\". But in this row, it seems like they were playing against themselves?\n\n7. **Check for correct results and competion**: It seems that the claim might be incorrect because it contains some ambiguity. However, looking at other rows containing relevant cells: 10 | 1996 - 07 - 28 | athens , ga | start | 2 - 1 aet | semifinal\n8. **Final check**: Now comparing to the original table, \"1996 - 08 - 01\" does not match any of the cells in column 'date'.\n\n9. **Conclusion**: Because we found that there is no match for August 1st, 1996 at location Atlanta with result and competition being as it's stated in the claim:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the relevant column\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look up the row index\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the match\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the date format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the dates\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the result and competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check for correct results and competion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Final check\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
