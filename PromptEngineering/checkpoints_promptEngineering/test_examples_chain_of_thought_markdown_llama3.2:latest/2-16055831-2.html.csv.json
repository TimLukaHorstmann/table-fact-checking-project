To do this, we'll go through each row in the table and check if the result is 'win' and the method is 'knockout (strikes)'.\n3. Starting from the top row, we can see that the fighter indeed wins with a knockout strike in the first round of the first match against Joa Mendes.\n4. Moving down to the next row, the same pattern repeats: wins by knockout strike against Larry Reynolds in the first round.\n5. This continues for the third, fourth, and fifth rows, where the fighter also wins by knockout strike against Hector Rodriguez, Luigi Maiolini, and another opponent (whose name is not specified).\n6. Now we move to the sixth row, where the fighter loses to Junior Pitbull with a knockout strike in the first round.\n7. We can see that this loss breaks the sequence of 5 consecutive knockout strikes wins. \n8. In the seventh row, the fighter wins against Zuluzinho, but with an armbar submission and not by knockout strike.\n9.

Look at the table for the year 1999. Check each row for a win with this date and location.\n\nLet's look at the table:\n\n| result   | record    | opponent         | method              | date            |   round | location         | notes     |\n|:---------|:----------|:-----------------|:--------------------|:----------------|--------:|:-----------------|:----------|\n| win      | 1 - 0 - 0 | joa mendes       | knockout (strikes)  | 1995            |       1 | itapeua , brazil | vale tudo |\n| win      | 2 - 0 - 0 | larry reynolds   | knockout (strikes)  | 1995            |       1 | itapeua , brazil | vale tudo |\n| win      | 3 - 0 - 0 | h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez | knockout (strikes)  | 1995            |       1 | itapeua , brazil | vale tanto |\n| win      | 4 - 0 - 0 | larry reynolds   | knockout (strikes)  | 1996            |       1 | itapeua , brazil | vale tudo |\n| win      | 5 - 0 - 0 | luigi maiolini   | knockout (strikes)  | 1999            |       1 | itapeua , brazil | vale tanto |\n\nFrom this table, we see that there are indeed three wins in the year 1999 with location 'itapeua, brazil'. The opponent for these wins is Luigi Maiolini.\n\nHere's a final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine if the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Look at the table for any loss records by the fighter in 2007. The relevant columns are date, round, location, notes.\n\n2. Check if there are 2 losses in 2007. There are 3 rows, but two of them have dates earlier than 2007 (5-0-0 - 1999 and 5-1-0 - 2003) , the other has date of November 4th (5-3-0). That's one loss in 2007. \n\n3. Check if both losses are due to knockout strikes or submission with armbar, not win.\n\n4. Look at each row that has date 2007 and see where the fights took place. The location is itapeua , brazil.
