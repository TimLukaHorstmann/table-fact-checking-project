The two relevant cells from the table confirm this: on July 7 and July 10 of 2008, the opponents were indeed referred to by such an alias but in different games outside the claimed series duration. Hence, the claim that they played a 4-game series against \"Angels\" is not supported by the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer Explanation:\n\n- The answer is FALSE because there was no match during July 7 through July 10, 2008, where the team referred as the \"Texas Rangers\" played a 4-game series against an opponent called the \"Angels\".\n- The relevant cells (7 and 10) show that in these specific dates of play, each game had its own unique name for their opposing teams.",

However, in Major League Baseball (MLB), there is no team called \"Texas Rangers\". The team based in Texas is actually called the Texas Rangers, which seems to be an error or confusion.\n\n2. **Assume the claim is referring to the Texas Rangers**: Given the ambiguity and potential for error, we will assume that the claim refers to the team typically known as the Texas Rangers (though this is not explicitly mentioned).\n\n3. **Identify games played by the assumed Texas Rangers team against Mariners**: We need to identify games where the Texas Rangers (assuming they are referred to in the table) play against the Mariners and see if any of these games were poorly attended.\n\n4. **Examine attendance figures for poorly attended games against Mariners**:\n    - July 28 | mariners   | 7 - 5        | francisco (2 - 3)    |        21742 | 54 - 52\n    - July 29 | mariners   | 11 - 10      | putz (2 - 4)         |        17618 | 55 - 52\n\n5. **Determine if any of these games were poorly attended**: \n    - The attendance for July 28 is 21742 and for July 29 is 17618.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n- Since the attendance on July 29 (17618) is lower than on July 28 (21742), it can be concluded that July 29's game was more poorly attended when playing against Mariners.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Identify the team & table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Assume the claim is referring to the Texas Rangers team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Identify games played by Texas Rangers against Mariners\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"Examine attendance figures for poorly attended games against Mariners\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Determine if any of these games were poorly attended\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"text\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This means Blevins lost to the Angels in July 2008.\n4. **Check Blevins' loss against the White Sox:**\n\t* In row 23, Blevins has a score of `1 - 3` with an opponent who is the White Sox. This means Blevins lost to the White Sox in July 2008.\n5. **Verify that both losses are in July 2008:**\n\t* Since there are no other relevant rows for Blevins after row 25, we can assume that both losses occurred in July 2008.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim states that Blevins has lost against both the Angels and the White Sox in July 2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate Blevins' information in the table\",\n      \"description\": \"Find row 25 (July 25) for the Angels game and row 23 (July 23) for the White Sox game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check Blevins' loss against the Angels\",\n      \"description\": \"In row 25, Blevins has a score of `0 - 1` with an opponent who is the Angels\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check Blevins' loss against the White Sox\",\n      \"description\": \"In row 23, Blevins has a score of `1 - 3` with an opponent who is the White Sox\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify that both losses are in July 2008\",\n      \"description\": \"Both losses occurred in July 2008 since there are no other relevant rows for Blevins after row 25\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}",
