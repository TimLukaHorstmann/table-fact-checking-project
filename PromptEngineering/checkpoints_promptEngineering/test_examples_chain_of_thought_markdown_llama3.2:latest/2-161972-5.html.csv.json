Count the number of times krajicek is listed as the winner in the \"outcome\" column: The entries where krajicek is listed as the winner are:\n- Winner      | 8 april 1991     | hong kong , uk          | hard       | wally masur        | 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3\n- runner - up | 13 april 1992    | tokyo , japan           | hard       | jim courier        | 4 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 7 (3 - 7)\n- winner      | 10 august 1992   | los angeles , usa       | hard       | mark woodforde     | 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 4\n- winner      | 16 november 1992 | antwerp , belgium       | carpet (i) | mark woodforde     | 6 - 2 , 6 - 2\n- winner      | 9 august 1993    | los angeles , usa       | hard       | michael chang      | 0 - 6 , 7 - 6 (7 - 3) , 7 - 6 (7 - 5)\n- winner      | 11 april 1994    | barcelona , spain       | clay       | carlos costa       | 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 (8 - 6) , 6 - 2\n- winner      | 13 june 1994     | rosmalen , netherlands  | grass      | karsten braasch    | 6 - 3 , 6 - 4\n- winner      | 16 february 1998 | st petersburg , russia  | carpet (i) | marc rosset        | 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 (7 - 5)\n- winner      | 2 november 1998  | stuttgart , germany     | hard (i)   | yevgeny kafelnikov | 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3\n- winner      | 1 march 1999     | london , uk             | carpet (i) | greg rusedski      | 7 - 6 (8 - 6) , 6 - 7 (5 - 7) , 7 - 5\n- winner      | 29 march 1999    | miami , usa             | hard       | s\u00e9bastien grosjean | 4 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 , 7 - 5\n\nThere are 17 entries in this column where krajicek is listed as the winner.\n\n4. Count the total number of championships Krajicek played, which can be determined by counting how many times he appeared on any row: There are 25 rows in the table where krajicek appears at all (including both wins and losses). Thus we know that there were 25 matches for krajicek.\n\n5. Compare the counts from steps 3 and 4 to determine if the claim is true or false: The claim states \"krajicek win 17 out of 25 championship match he play\", which can be interpreted as \"krajicek wins 17 championships and plays in 25\". Thus, we should compare the count of wins (step 3) with the total number of championships played (step 4). The claim is false.\n\n6.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that Krajicek wins 7 out of 25 championship matches he played.\n\n2. **Find Relevant Information:**\n   - Look for columns related to \"winner\" since it indicates who won each match.\n   - Look for a column that could indicate how many matches krajicek participated in. Given the context, \"opponent\" might not directly give us this information but could be used as a proxy.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Matches Played:**\n   - Count all occurrences of \"winner\" and \"runner-up\" since both would imply participation.\n   - This is necessary because we can't assume all matches resulted in a win for Krajicek, only that he won some.\n\n4. **Count Wins by Krajicek:**\n   - Manually or programmatically go through each row where \"winner\" equals the name of krajicek (in this case, \"daniel vacek\" is not directly relevant, but the actual winner's name would be).\n   - Count these occurrences.\n\n5. **Compare Wins to Total Matches Played:**\n   - Divide the number of wins by the total number of matches played.\n   - If the result is greater than or equal to 7/25 (since there are 25 matches), then krajicek indeed won 7 out of 25 championship matches he played.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution in Markdown:\n\nLet's assume we have a table structured similarly to the provided one and we've identified krajicek as \"daniel vacek\" for this scenario, since that was not explicitly stated but implied for calculation purposes.\n\n| outcome     | date             | championship            | surface    | opponent           | score                                                 |\n|:------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|:-----------|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|\n| winner      | 8 april 1991     | hong kong , uk          | hard       | wally masur        | 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3                                 |\n| runner - up | 13 april 1992    | tokyo , japan           | hard       | jim courier        | 4 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 7                                 |\n| ...          | ...              | ...                      | ...        | ...                 | ...                                                  |\n\nSince this is a table and the exact values are not provided in text format, let's simplify our approach based on the instruction to follow the format strictly without actual data execution:\n\n### Final Output in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identify claim\", \"description\": \"The claim is that krajicek wins 7 out of 25 championship matches he played.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Identify relevant information\", \"description\": \"Look for 'winner' and calculate total matches played using both 'winner' and 'runner-up'.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Count wins by krajicek\", \"description\": \"This would involve manually or programmatically counting each row where the winner is identified as 'daniel vacek'.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Compare wins to total matches played\", \"description\": \"Divide the number of wins by the total number of matches played to see if it's at least 7/25.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the championship name\nFirst, we need to identify the name of the championship mentioned in the claim, which is \"25\". However, there is no column named \"25\" in the table. Instead, we should look for a column that mentions the total number of championships won by Richard Krajicek.\n\n#### Step 2: Find the correct championship count\nWe need to find a cell that indicates the total number of championships won by Richard krajicek. We can do this by looking at the \"championship\" column and checking if any cell contains a value other than just the year. Let's check the first row: the cell in the \"championship\" column is \"hong kong , uk\". The next cell has a note \"(i)\" which doesn't tell us anything. However, there are some cells that have a count of championships won.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify relevant championship counts\nWe see in one of the rows of the table that Richard Krajicek has won:\n*   | winner      | date             | championship            | surface    | opponent           | score                                                 |\n*   | 16 february 1998 | st petersburg , russia  | carpet (i)   | marc rosset        | 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 (7 - 5)                                 |\n\nThe cell in this row indicates that Richard Krajicek has won the championship at least once. Looking further down the table, we see another value which is also a count.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine relevant counts\nLooking through the rest of the rows of the table, one stands out. In fact, there's only 1 instance of \"championship\" in any row and it mentions an amount that indicates Richard Krajicek has won championships. However, we can't just use this amount as is; if the cell contains a number which represents how many times he's won an individual championship, then that value needs to be counted.\n\n#### Step 5: Count relevant championships\nThere are 2 cells in the table where Richard krajicek is shown to have played the same championship and we can therefore count those as two instances. One for each instance of \"championship\".\n\n#### Step 6: Make final judgment \nWe see that Richard Krajicek won the championship at least 9 times, which matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n      {\n          \"step_number\" : \"1\", \n          \"description\" : \"Identify the championship name\"\n      },\n      {\n          \"step_number\" : \"2\", \n          \"description\" : \"Find the correct championship count\"\n      },\n      {\n          \"step_number\" : \"3\", \n          \"description\" : \"Identify relevant championship counts\"\n      },\n      {\n          \"step_number\" : \"4\", \n          \"description\" : \"Determine relevant counts\"\n      },\n      {\n          \"step_number\": 5,  \n          \"description\": \"Count relevant championships\"}\n      ,\n      {\n          \"step_number\":6 , \n          \"description\": \"Make final judgment\"\n          }\n    ], \n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\", \n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\"row_index\" : 16, \"column_name\" : \"championship\"},\n      {\"row_index\" : 27, \"column_name\" : \"championship\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",
