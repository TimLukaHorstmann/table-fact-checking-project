The last row we see is the one with the highest year value.\n\n4. **Verify the year of the bottom row**: We check the \"year\" column of the bottom row and find that it indeed says 1990, not 1979.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the year in the last row (1990) does not match the claim (1979), we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Understand the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the relevant data: year column of table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Locate the bottom row in the table by looking for the highest year value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Verify the year of the bottom row, which should match the claim (1979)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion: since the year in the last row does not match the claim, conclude that the claim is FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
