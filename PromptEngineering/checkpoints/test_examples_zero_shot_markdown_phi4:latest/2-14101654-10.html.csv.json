    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"2 players be draft in each round 3 and 9,\" we need to analyze the table for rounds 3 and 9 specifically:\n\n### Round 3:\n- Look at row 0 (the first relevant cell after headers):\n  - **Round**: 3\n  - **Player**: rob bellamy\n\nThis indicates there is only one player drafted in round 3.\n\n### Round 9:\n- Look at rows 10 and 11:\n  - Row 10:\n    - **Round**: 9\n    - **Player**: triston grant\n  - Row 11:\n    - **Round**: 9\n    - **Player**: john carter\n\nThis indicates there are two players drafted in round 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Round 3 has only one player, not two.\n- Round 9 has two players, which matches the claim for this round.\n\nSince the condition of having \"2 players be draft in each round\" is not met for both rounds (specifically failing for round 3), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Round 3: Row 0\n- For Round 9: Rows 10 and 11\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
