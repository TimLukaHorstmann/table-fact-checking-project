This is more than 1 goal.\n\n6. **Check Other Years**:\n   - Review other rows for any year where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal.\n   - Only in the year 2000 do we find an instance (Row 3) where he scored more than 1 goal.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is TRUE because 2000 is indeed the only year when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal in international competition according to this table.\n\n8. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those that confirm he scored more than 1 goal in 2000 and no other years.\n   - Rows 2 and 3 from columns \"date\", \"score\", and \"competition\" are relevant.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012,\" we need to check for any records in those years where Rafael M\u00e1rquez's team scored a goal. This means checking if there are entries for 2001, 2009, and 2012 with non-zero goals scored by his team.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- **Year 2001**: There is no entry in the year 2001.\n- **Year 2009**: There is no entry in the year 2009.\n- **Year 2012**: There is no entry in the year 2012.\n\nSince there are no entries for any of these years, Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score a goal because he didn't play (or at least wasn't listed) in international competitions during those specific years. Therefore, the claim that he \"did not remain scoreless\" is trivially true because there are no instances where he was involved in an international competition with a non-zero score.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE, and since there are no relevant cells for these years, the list of relevant cells will be empty.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze each goal scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez from the table and assess whether Mexico lost any international competition matches when he scored.\n\nFirst, let's define the relevant criteria:\n1. Identify goals scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez.\n2. Determine if these goals were in an \"international competition\" (not a friendly match).\n3. Check the result of those matches to see if Mexico lost.\n\nThe table provides information about each goal, including the date, score at the time of the goal, final result, and competition type.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Scored in \"1999 carlsberg cup\" (not specified as friendly), Result: 3 - 0 (win).\n- **Row 2**: Scored in \"2000 concacaf gold cup\", Result: 4 - 0 (win).\n- **Row 3**: Scored in \"2002 world cup qualifier\", Result: 7 - 1 (win).\n- **Row 4**: Scored in a \"friendly\" match, not relevant.\n- **Row 5**: Scored in \"2003 concacaf gold cup\", Result: 2 - 0 (win).\n- **Row 6**: Scored in \"2006 world cup qualifier\", Result: 3 - 0 (win).\n- **Row 7**: Scored in \"2006 world cup qualifier\", Result: 5 - 0 (win).\n- **Row 8**: Scored in \"2006 fifa world cup\", Result: 1 - 2 (aet) (loss).\n- **Row 9**: Scored in a \"friendly\" match, not relevant.\n- **Row 10**: Scored in \"2010 world cup qualifier\", Result: 2 - 1 (win).\n- **Row 11**: Scored in \"2010 fifa world cup\", Result: 1 - 1 (draw).\n- **Row 12**: Scored in \"2011 concacaf gold cup\", Result: 4 - 1 (win).\n- **Row 13**: Scored in a \"friendly\" match, not relevant.\n\nNow, let's summarize the matches where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in international competitions:\n- Match results are wins or draws, except for Row 8.\n- In Row 8 (\"2006 fifa world cup\"), Mexico lost (1 - 2 after extra time).\n\nThis means there is only one instance where Mexico lost an international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored.
