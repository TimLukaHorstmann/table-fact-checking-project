    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Detroit tie for the highest home team score\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the \"score\" column in the provided table where Detroit is listed as the home team. Here's how the evaluation is conducted:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: First, identify all rows where Detroit is listed under the \"home\" column. These are:\n   - January 3\n   - January 5\n   - January 7\n   - January 10\n   - January 14\n   - January 16\n   - January 19\n   - January 22\n   - January 24\n   - January 26\n   - January 29\n\n2. **Extract Detroit's Scores**: Extract the scores from these rows where Detroit is the home team:\n   - January 3: 3 (Detroit)\n   - January 5: 6 (Detroit)\n   - January 7: 0 (Detroit)\n   - January 10: 1 (Detroit)\n   - January 14: 4 (Detroit)\n   - January 16: 3 (Detroit)\n   - January 19: 1 (Detroit)\n   - January 22: 5 (Detroit)\n   - January 24: 2 (Detroit)\n   - January 26: 2 (Detroit)\n   - January 29: 5 (Detroit)\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Score**: The highest score by Detroit as a home team is 6, which occurred on January 5.\n\n4. **Check for Ties with Other Teams**: Now, check all rows to see if any other home team scored 6 in a game:\n   - Look at each row where another team is listed as the \"home\" and compare their scores.\n   - No other home team has a score of 6 against Detroit or any other opponent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since no other home team tied with Detroit's highest score of 6, Detroit does not tie for the highest home team score.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to support this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
