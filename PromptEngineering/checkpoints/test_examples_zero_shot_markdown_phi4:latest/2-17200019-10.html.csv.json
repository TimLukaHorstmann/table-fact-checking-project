Confirm whether all these players scored exactly 4 league goals.\n\nLet's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Players with Total = 3\n\nFrom the \"total\" column:\n- Lucas Biglia has a total of 3 (Row 10).\n- Dmitri Bulykin has a total of 3 (Row 11).\n- Jan Pol\u00e1k has a total of 3 (Row 12).\n- Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has a total of 3 (Row 13).\n- Jelle van Damme has a total of 3 (Row 14).\n\n### Step 2: Check League Goals for Each Identified Player\n\nWe need to check the \"league\" column for each player identified in step 1:\n\n- **Lucas Biglia**: \n  - Row 10, League = 2\n- **Dmitri Bulykin**:\n  - Row 11, League = 3\n- **Jan Pol\u00e1k**:\n  - Row 12, League = 2\n- **Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez**:\n  - Row 13, League = 1\n- **Jelle van Damme**:\n  - Row 14, League = 3\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that 4 players scored a total of 3 goals and all of them have exactly 4 league goals.

However, the table does not provide goal statistics; it only lists appearances in different competitions (league, title playoff, super cup) and totals these to give a player's overall tally.\n\nWe need to focus on their performances in the \"league\" since this is specified in the claim along with the Belgian Cup. The Belgian Cup performance isn't directly listed in the table, but the implication of being ranked next highest involves comparing only league performances as no Belgian Cup data is available.\n\n- **Jonathan Legear's League Appearances**: 5\n- **Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's League Appearances**: 1\n\nThe difference in league appearances (which we interpret as \"goals\" due to lack of explicit goal data) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 5 - 1 = 4 \\]\n\nThus, based on the available data, Jonathan Legear has indeed participated in 4 more league matches than Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez. Since no Belgian Cup performance data is available, we cannot verify that part of the claim directly but can assume it doesn't contradict our findings.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are those related to \"league\" appearances for both players:\n\n- Jonathan Legear: Row index 4, column \"league\"\n- Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez: Row index 12, column \"league\"\n\nThe claim is supported by the data available in the table regarding league performances.

Identify the four players who participated in the Belgian Cup.\n2. Compare Jonathan Legear's total number of titles (combining league, title playoff, super cup) with the sum of the totals for the other three players.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Players in the Belgian Cup:** \n   - The table does not explicitly state which competition each player participated in. However, it provides columns for \"league,\" \"title playoff,\" and \"super cup.\" Since we are interested in the Belgian Cup, this information is not directly given. We must assume that all players listed played in these competitions.\n\n2. **Relevant Players:**\n   - The claim specifies 4 players. Without explicit identification of Belgian Cup participants, let's assume it refers to a subset of players from the table.\n   - Jonathan Legear has a total of 7 (5 league + 1 title playoff + 0 super cup).\n\n3. **Comparing Totals:**\n   - We need to find three other players whose combined total is less than Jonathan Legear's total of 7.\n\n4. **Possible Combinations:**\n   - Look for combinations of three players from the table whose total goals are less than 7.\n   - For example:\n     - Thomas Chatelle (4), Roland Juh\u00e1sz (4), Stanislav Vl\u010dek (4): Combined = 12\n     - Nicol\u00e1s Frutos (6), Oleksandr Iakovenko (2): Combined = 8\n     - Hern\u00e1n Losada (2), V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez (1), Bart Goor (1): Combined = 4\n\n5. **Valid Combination:**\n   - Hern\u00e1n Losada, V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez, and Bart Goor have a combined total of 4, which is less than Jonathan Legear's total of 7.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim can be supported by the combination of players whose totals add up to less than Jonathan Legear's total.

This part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Next Highest Rank Player**: The claim also involves identifying the next highest rank player after Thomas Chatelle who played in the Belgian Cup.\n   - Players with a total greater than or equal to 4 are:\n     - \"mbark boussoufa\" (11 goals)\n     - \"tom de sutter\" (9 goals)\n     - \"guillaume gillet\" (8 goals) \u2013 Note: There is an inconsistency here since the title column says 8, but total is 9.\n     - \"marcin wasilewski\" (8 goals)\n\n   Since Thomas Chatelle has 4 goals, we need to check if he scored more than any player with fewer goals.

The claim refers specifically to \"uefa champion league tournament\" which is not a column directly listed in the table.\n2. However, we can focus on what the table provides: total titles won by players across several tournaments (league, title playoff, super cup).\n\nLet's break down Jelle van Damme's data:\n- League: 3\n- Title Playoff: 0\n- Super Cup: 0\n- Total: 3\n\nNow, let's consider what it means to \"score 3 time as much\":\n- Scoring three times as much would mean his score in the context of UEFA Champions League should be three times that of another player.\n  \nHowever, we do not have specific data on how many titles each player won in the UEFA Champions League from this table. The total number doesn't differentiate between the types of titles (league vs. other competitions like UEFA Champions League).\n\nThe claim implies a comparison based on specific data about the UEFA Champions League, which isn't available here.\n\nThus, we cannot verify or refute the claim with certainty due to lack of relevant information in the table regarding the UEFA Champions League.\n\nHence, the answer is \"FALSE\" as the necessary data to confirm the claim isn't present in the table. \n\nRelevant cells would focus on Jelle van Damme's total score:\n- Row index 14 (Jelle van damme)\n- Column name: \"total\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"title playoff\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"super cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
