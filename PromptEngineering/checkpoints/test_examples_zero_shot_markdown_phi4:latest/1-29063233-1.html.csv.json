    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Moore directed three episodes of series 2 of Merlin\" is true based on the provided table, we need to evaluate specific conditions:\n\n1. The person in question must be David Moore.\n2. He should have directed exactly three episodes.\n3. These episodes must belong to \"series 2 of Merlin.\"\n\n**Steps to Validate:**\n\n- **Identify the Director Column:** \n  - The column that mentions directors is labeled \"directed by.\" We will check this column for entries related to David Moore.\n\n- **Count the Episodes Directed by David Moore:**\n  - Traverse through each row and count how many times David Moore appears in the \"directed by\" column.\n  \n- **Verify Series Information:**\n  - The table includes a column labeled \"no overall,\" which is likely indicating the episode number across all series, and another column \"no for series,\" which specifically mentions the episode number within this particular series. We need to verify if these episodes fall under \"series 2.\"\n\n**Relevant Data from Table:**\n\n1. **Row Index 0:** \n   - Directed by David Moore\n   - Episode Number (for series): 1\n   \n2. **Row Index 3:** \n   - Directed by David Moore\n   - Episode Number (for series): 4\n\n3. **Row Index 4:** \n   - Directed by David Moore\n   - Episode Number (for series): 5\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- David Moore directed episodes at Row Indices 0, 3, and 4.\n- The \"no for series\" column indicates the episodes are numbered 1, 4, and 5 within this specific series.\n- These episodes do not form a consecutive sequence or suggest they belong to \"series 2\" specifically. They are part of a single series (as indicated by the consistent numbering in \"no for series\"), but we can't determine if it's series 2 of Merlin from the given table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim specifies that David Moore directed three episodes of \"series 2 of Merlin.\" The table does not provide explicit confirmation that this is indeed series 2, as no column explicitly labels or confirms this. It only shows three episodes directed by him in a sequence which doesn't match up with being part of series 2 specifically.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, we cannot fully confirm that these are \"series 2 of Merlin.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
