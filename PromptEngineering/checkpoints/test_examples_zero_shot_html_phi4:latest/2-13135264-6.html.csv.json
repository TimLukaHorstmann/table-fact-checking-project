Score: 2 - 5.\n8. **January 31**: Carolina (visitor) vs. Detroit (home).

This matches the claim's statement about January 5 and the score of 6 points.\n\n- **January 7:** Home (Detroit) vs Visitor (Boston) | Score: 3 - 0\n  - Detroit scored 3 goals.\n\n- **January 10:** Visitor (Detroit) vs Home (Boston) | Score: 1 - 2\n  - Detroit scored 1 goal.\n\n- **January 14:** Home (Detroit) vs Visitor (Chicago) | Score: 2 - 4\n  - Detroit scored 2 goals.\n\n- **January 16:** Home (Detroit) vs Visitor (Phoenix) | Score: 3 - 3\n  - Detroit scored 3 goals.\n\n- **January 19:** Visitor (Detroit) vs Home (San Jose) | Score: 1 - 2\n  - Detroit scored 1 goal.\n\n- **January 21:** Visitor (Detroit) vs Home (Anaheim) | Score: 2 - 2\n  - Detroit scored 2 goals.\n\n- **January 22:** Visitor (Detroit) vs Home (Los Angeles) | Score: 5 - 4\n  - Detroit scored 5 goals.\n\n- **January 24:** Visitor (Detroit) vs Home (Phoenix) | Score: 2 - 5\n  - Detroit scored 2 goals.\n\n- **January 26:** Visitor (Detroit) vs Home (Dallas) | Score: 2 - 2\n  - Detroit scored 2 goals.\n\n- **January 29:** Home (Detroit) vs Visitor (New Jersey) | Score: 2 - 5\n  - Detroit scored 2 goals.\n\n- **January 31:** Home (Detroit) vs Visitor (Carolina) | Score: 4 - 4\n  - Detroit scored 4 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe highest number of goals Detroit scored in a single game is indeed 6, which occurred on January 5 against Nashville.

The claim states it occurs on 6 dates, which is incorrect based on the data provided.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding tie for the largest point gap occurring twice during the season, we need to examine the \"score\" column in each row of the table. The point gap is determined by the absolute difference between the two numbers in the \"score\" column.\n\nLet's calculate the point gaps:\n\n1. January 2: Detroit vs. Carolina, Score 4 - 1 \u2192 Point Gap = |4 - 1| = 3\n2. January 3: Anaheim vs. Detroit, Score 1 - 3 \u2192 Point Gap = |1 - 3| = 2\n3. January 5: Nashville vs. Detroit, Score 0 - 6 \u2192 Point Gap = |0 - 6| = 6\n4. January 7: Boston vs. Detroit, Score 3 - 0 \u2192 Point Gap = |3 - 0| = 3\n5. January 10: Detroit vs. Boston, Score 1 - 2 \u2192 Point Gap = |1 - 2| = 1\n6. January 14: Chicago vs. Detroit, Score 2 - 4 \u2192 Point Gap = |2 - 4| = 2\n7. January 16: Phoenix vs. Detroit, Score 3 - 3 \u2192 Point Gap = |3 - 3| = 0\n8. January 19: Detroit vs. San Jose, Score 1 - 2 \u2192 Point Gap = |1 - 2| = 1\n9. January 21: Detroit vs. Anaheim, Score 2 - 2 \u2192 Point Gap = |2 - 2| = 0\n10. January 22: Detroit vs. Los Angeles, Score 5 - 4 \u2192 Point Gap = |5 - 4| = 1\n11. January 24: Detroit vs. Phoenix, Score 2 - 5 \u2192 Point Gap = |2 - 5| = 3\n12. January 26: Detroit vs. Dallas, Score 2 - 2 \u2192 Point Gap = |2 - 2| = 0\n13. January 29: New Jersey vs. Detroit, Score 2 - 5 \u2192 Point Gap = |2 - 5| = 3\n14. January 31: Carolina vs. Detroit, Score 4 - 4 \u2192 Point Gap = |4 - 4| = 0\n\nThe largest point gap is 6, which occurs only once on January 5.\n\nThe next largest point gaps are 3, which occur three times (January 2, January 7, January 24, and January 29).\n\nSince the largest point gap of 6 occurs only once, there cannot be a tie for it. Therefore, there is no scenario where there is a tie for the largest point gap occurring twice.\n\nThus, the claim \"there be a tie for the largest point gap 2 time during the season\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
