The claim states that except for Slovakia, all other countries represented in the table are from North America.\n2.

Therefore, the claim is supported by the data as only one country, Slovakia, is not from North America. Hence, the answer is \"TRUE\".",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze Triston Grant's draft position and compare it with other players drafted in the same round.\n\nThe table indicates:\n- Triston Grant is a \"left wing\" and was drafted in \"round 9.\"\n\nWe will examine all entries for \"round 9\":\n1. Triston Grant: \n   - Position: Left Wing\n   - Round: 9\n\n2. John Carter:\n   - Position: Center\n   - Round: 9\n\nFor the claim to be TRUE, every player drafted in round 9 must play the same position as Triston Grant (Left Wing). However, we observe that John Carter plays a different position (Center).\n\nSince not all players from round 9 play the \"left wing\" position, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
