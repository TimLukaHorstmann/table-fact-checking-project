We need to find rows where this value is non-zero.\n\n2. **Determine Jonathan Legear's Contribution:**\n   From the table, we identify that Jonathan Legear has 1 title in the \"title playoff\" category and a total of 7 titles across all categories.\n\n3. **Evaluate Other Players' Contributions:**\n   We need to sum up the totals for players who have any contribution (i.e., non-zero values) in the \"title playoff\" column other than Jonathan Legear. \n\n4. **Compare Totals:**\n   Finally, compare Jonathan Legear's total with the combined total of others involved in the Belgian Cup.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n- From the table:\n  - Jonathan Legear is the only player with a non-zero value in the \"title playoff\" column (1 title).\n  - No other players have any titles listed under \"title playoff.\"\n\nSince no other players are involved in the Belgian Cup based on this data, there are no combined goals from other players to compare against Jonathan Legear's total.\n\nThus, by default:\n- Jonathan Legear's total of 7 is greater than the combined total (0) of others since no other player has any contribution in this category.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Jonathan Legear scored more goals than the other players combined\" holds true given these conditions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title playoff\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere, the relevant cells include Jonathan Legear's entries in the \"title playoff\" and \"total\" columns to demonstrate his involvement and compare against others.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"jelle van damme score 3 time as much as each of the other 2 player in the uefa champion league tournament,\" we need to check the data relevant to Jelle Van Damme's performance in the UEFA Champions League and compare it with others.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data for Jelle Van Damme:**\n   - According to the table, Jelle Van Damme has a value of 3 under the \"total\" column.\n   - The breakdown shows:\n     - `league` = 3\n     - `title playoff` = 0\n     - `super cup` = 0\n\n2. **Interpretation:**\n   - The claim refers to scoring in the UEFA Champions League, which would be part of the \"league\" category.\n   - Jelle Van Damme has a value of 3 under \"league,\" suggesting he participated or scored in 3 UEFA Champions League matches/tournaments.\n\n3. **Comparison with Other Players:**\n   - The claim states that Jelle Van Damme scored 3 times as much as each of the other two players.\n   - We need to find if there are any other players with a \"league\" value, and whether Jelle's score is three times theirs.\n\n4. **Check Other Players' \"League\" Values:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Mbark Boussoufa: 11\n     - Tom De Sutter: 9\n     - Guillaume Gillet: 8\n     - Marcin Wasilewski: 8\n     - Jonathan Legear: 5\n     - Nicol\u00e1s Frutos: 6\n     - Thomas Chatelle: 4\n     - Roland Juh\u00e1sz: 4\n     - Stanislav Vl\u010dek: 4\n     - Lucas Biglia: 2\n     - Dmitri Bulykin: 3\n     - Jan Pol\u00e1k: 2\n     - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez: 1\n     - Oleksandr Iakovenko: 2\n     - Hern\u00e1n Losada: 1\n     - V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez: 1\n     - Bart Goor: 1\n     - Nemanja Rni\u0107: 0\n\n5. **Identify Players with \"League\" Value of 1:**\n   - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez, Oleksandr Iakovenko, Hern\u00e1n Losada, V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez, Bart Goor each have a \"league\" value of 1.\n   - Jelle Van Damme's \"league\" value (3) is indeed three times the \"league\" value of these players.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim holds true for players with a \"league\" score of 1, as Jelle Van Damme has exactly three times their score.\n   - Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table data, let's analyze each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Claim Part 1: \"Though 4 players from Belgian first division are in the top 19 scorers...\"**\n\n   - The term \"Belgian first division\" suggests we're considering players possibly linked to Belgium or its league.\n   - From the table, the players potentially related to Belgian football could be:\n     - mbark boussoufa\n     - tom de sutter\n     - guillaume gillet\n     - thomas chatelle\n     - jelle van damme\n\n   - These 5 players are associated with Belgium and appear in the top 19 scorers (since there are only 19 rows).\n   - Therefore, at least 4 Belgian first division players being among the top 19 is true.\n\n2. **Claim Part 2: \"The top scorer (mat\u00edas su\u00e1rez) has 5 fewer goals than bart goor, who have 11 goals.\"**\n\n   - According to the table:\n     - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's total is 3.\n     - Bart Goor's total is 1.\n\n   - The claim states that Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez should have 5 fewer goals than Bart Goor, implying:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Bart Goor's goals} = \\text{Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's goals} + 5\n     \\]\n\n   - If we assume Bart Goor has 11 goals (as per the claim), then Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez should have:\n     \\[\n     11 - 5 = 6 \\text{ goals}\n     \\]\n\n   - However, Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez actually has 3 total titles according to the table, and Bart Goor has 1. This contradicts the statement that Bart Goor has 11 goals or that Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has 5 fewer than 11.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
