    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jelle Van Damme is true or false based on the provided table data, we need to analyze the information given for each player with respect to their achievements in the league, title playoffs, super cup, and total.\n\nThe specific claim states: \"Jelle van damme scored 3 times as much as each of the other 2 players in the UEFA Champions League tournament.\"\n\n1. First, identify Jelle Van Damme's total:\n   - Row 14 shows that Jelle Van Damme has a total score of 3.\n\n2. To assess if he scored \"3 times as much\" as two other players, we need to check if there are any players with a total score that is one-third of his total (i.e., \\( \\frac{3}{3} = 1\\)).\n\n3. Look for players with a total score of 1:\n   - Row 17: V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez has a total score of 1.\n   - Row 18: Bart Goor has a total score of 1.\n\n4. Now, confirm that these are the only players with a total score of 1. This means Jelle Van Damme's total (3) is indeed three times the total score of V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez and Bart Goor (both have totals of 1).\n\n5. The claim specifically mentions \"each of the other 2 players,\" which aligns with our finding that there are exactly two players, each having a total of 1.\n\nSince Jelle Van Damme's total is three times the total scores of V\u00edctor Bern\u00e1rdez and Bart Goor, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
