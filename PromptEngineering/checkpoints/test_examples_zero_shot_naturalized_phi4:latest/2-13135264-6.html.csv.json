However, the claim specifically refers to the highest score being \"on January 5 with 6 point,\" and not just the highest number of points scored in a single game by Detroit. The highest combined score for any game is found in row 1 (January 2) with a total of 4 + 1 = 5, but this does not affect Detroit's individual performance as the claim focuses on Detroit's score.\n\nThe highest score achieved by Detroit alone was indeed 6 points, which occurred on January 5.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the score gaps for each game in which Detroit was either home or visitor. The point gap is calculated as the absolute difference between the two teams' scores.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the games and their respective score differences:\n\n1. **January 2**: Detroit (Home) vs. Carolina - Score: 4-1, Point Gap: |4-1| = 3\n2. **January 3**: Anaheim (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 1-3, Point Gap: |1-3| = 2\n3. **January 5**: Nashville (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 0-6, Point Gap: |0-6| = 6\n4. **January 7**: Boston (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 3-0, Point Gap: |3-0| = 3\n5. **January 10**: Detroit (Visitor) vs. Boston (Home) - Score: 1-2, Point Gap: |1-2| = 1\n6. **January 14**: Chicago (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 2-4, Point Gap: |2-4| = 2\n7. **January 16**: Phoenix (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 3-3, Point Gap: |3-3| = 0\n8. **January 19**: San Jose (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 2-1, Point Gap: |2-1| = 1\n9. **January 21**: Anaheim (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 2-2, Point Gap: |2-2| = 0\n10. **January 22**: Los Angeles (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 4-5, Point Gap: |4-5| = 1\n11. **January 24**: Phoenix (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 5-2, Point Gap: |5-2| = 3\n12. **January 26**: Dallas (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 2-2, Point Gap: |2-2| = 0\n13. **January 29**: New Jersey (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 2-5, Point Gap: |2-5| = 3\n14. **January 31**: Carolina (Visitor) vs. Detroit (Home) - Score: 4-4, Point Gap: |4-4| = 0\n\nThe largest point gap is 6, which occurs on January 5. There is only one game with this point gap.\n\nNext, we identify the second-largest point gaps:\n\n- **Point Gap of 3** appears in the games:\n  - January 2\n  - January 7\n  - January 24\n  - January 29\n\nSince there are four occurrences of a point gap of 3, it is tied for the largest after considering the unique highest value (6).\n\nThe claim states that there should be a tie for the largest point gap exactly two times. However, we observe that the second-largest point gap occurs more than twice.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
