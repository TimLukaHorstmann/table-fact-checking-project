    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Riaan van Zyl having the longest time span on the United States national rugby union team and tying with only one other player for the greatest number of tries, we will analyze the data in the table.\n\n1. **Time Span Analysis:**\n   - \"vaeea anitoni\" (1992 - 2000) has a span of 8 years.\n   - \"paul emerick\" (2003 - 2012) has a span of 9 years.\n   - \"todd clever\" (2003 -) does not have an end year, but it's clearly longer than any other complete time spans listed.\n   - \"philip eloff\" (2000 - 2007) has a span of 7 years.\n   - \"takudzwa ngwenya\" (2007 -) also lacks an end year, suggesting an ongoing period longer than any specified full range.\n   - \"chris wyles\" (2007 -) lacks an end year as well, indicating an ongoing period.\n   - \"david fee\" (2002 - 2005) has a span of 3 years.\n   - \"mike hercus\" (2000 - 2009) has a span of 9 years.\n   - \"riaan van zyl\" (2003 - 2004) has a span of 1 year.\n\nFrom this analysis, Riaan van Zyl does not have the longest time span. Players like Todd Clever, Takudzwa Ngwenya, and Chris Wyles all have ongoing periods that surpass Riaan's single-year span.\n\n2. **Tries Analysis:**\n   - \"vaeea anitoni\" has 26 tries.\n   - \"paul emerick\" has 17 tries.\n   - \"todd clever\" has 11 tries.\n   - \"philip eloff\" has 10 tries.\n   - \"takudzwa ngwenya\" has 10 tries.\n   - \"chris wyles\" has 10 tries.\n   - \"david fee\" has 9 tries.\n   - \"mike hercus\" has 9 tries.\n   - \"riaan van zyl\" has 9 tries.\n\nRiaan van Zyl has 9 tries, tying with David Fee and Mike Hercus for the greatest number of tries. Thus, he is tied with two other players, not just one as claimed.\n\nBased on this analysis, both parts of the claim are false:\n- Riaan van Zyl does not have the longest time span.\n- He ties with two players (not only one) for the greatest number of tries.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
