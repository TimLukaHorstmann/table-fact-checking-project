    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 times in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal,\" we need to analyze the provided table data for matches where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored and determine whether Mexico won or lost those matches.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Goals by Rafael M\u00e1rquez:**\n   - We assume that each entry in the \"score\" column represents goals scored by Mexico, and Rafael M\u00e1rquez is one of the scorers for these goals.\n   - We need to identify rows where Mexico has a positive score (i.e., they scored at least one goal).\n\n2. **Determine Match Outcomes:**\n   - For each match identified in step 1, compare the \"score\" and \"result\" columns:\n     - If \"score\" is less than \"result,\" Mexico lost.\n     - If \"score\" is equal to or greater than \"result,\" Mexico won or drew.\n\n3. **Count Wins, Losses, and Draws:**\n   - Count how many times Mexico won, lost, or drew in these matches.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Mexico loses 1 out of 2 times when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores.\n   - Calculate the ratio of losses to total matches where M\u00e1rquez scored and verify if it is 1/2.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 0:** Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"3 - 0\" (Win)\n- **Row 1:** Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"4 - 0\" (Win)\n- **Row 2:** Score = \"5 - 1\", Result = \"7 - 1\" (Win)\n- **Row 3:** Score = \"2 - 1\", Result = \"2 - 1\" (Draw)\n- **Row 5:** Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"2 - 0\" (Win)\n- **Row 6:** Score = \"3 - 0\", Result = \"3 - 0\" (Win)\n- **Row 7:** Score = \"2 - 0\", Result = \"5 - 0\" (Win)\n- **Row 9:** Score = \"2 - 2\", Result = \"4 - 2\" (Win)\n- **Row 10:** Score = \"2 - 0\", Result = \"2 - 1\" (Win)\n- **Row 12:** Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"4 - 1\" (Win)\n- **Row 13:** Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"4 - 2\" (Win)\n\nFrom the analysis, Mexico did not lose in any of these matches. They won or drew all matches where M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Total Matches with M\u00e1rquez scoring: 11\n- Wins: 10\n- Losses: 0\n\nThe claim that \"Mexico loses 1 out of 2 times\" is incorrect because Mexico did not lose any match when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
