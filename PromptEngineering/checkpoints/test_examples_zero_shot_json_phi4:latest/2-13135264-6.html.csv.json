We will extract and sum up the scores of Detroit as a visitor from the \"score\" column.\n\nHere are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Detroit as Visitor:**\n   - Look at each row in the \"data\" list to check if the \"visitor\" is \"detroit\".\n\n2. **Extract Scores for Detroit as Visitor:**\n   - For each game where Detroit is the visitor, extract the score from the \"score\" column.\n   - The score format is \"D-T\", where D represents Detroit's score and T represents the home team's score.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Points:**\n   - Sum up all the points that Detroit scored in these games as a visitor.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- January 3: Detroit scores 1 point against Anaheim (Anaheim vs Detroit, 1-3)\n- January 10: Detroit scores 1 point against Boston (Boston vs Detroit, 2-1)\n- January 19: Detroit scores 1 point against San Jose (San Jose vs Detroit, 2-1)\n- January 21: Detroit scores 2 points against Anaheim (Anaheim vs Detroit, 2-2)\n- January 22: Detroit scores 5 points against Los Angeles (Los Angeles vs Detroit, 4-5)\n- January 24: Detroit scores 2 points against Phoenix (Phoenix vs Detroit, 5-2)\n- January 26: Detroit scores 2 points against Dallas (Dallas vs Detroit, 2-2)\n- January 31: Detroit scores 4 points against Carolina (Carolina vs Detroit, 4-4)\n\n**Total Points Scored by Detroit as Visitor:**\n1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 18\n\nThe claim states that Detroit has the highest visitor score with \"5 points.\" However, while Detroit did score 5 points in one game (January 22 against Los Angeles), their total score across all games as a visitor is 18 points.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the point gaps in the games listed in the table and see if any gap occurs twice.\n\nThe relevant column for determining the point gap is \"score.\" We'll extract the score differences for each game involving Detroit:\n\n1. January 2: Detroit 4 - 1 Carolina \u2192 Point Gap = 3\n2. January 3: Anaheim 1 - 3 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 2\n3. January 5: Nashville 0 - 6 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 6\n4. January 7: Boston 3 - 0 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 3\n5. January 10: Boston 2 - 1 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 1\n6. January 14: Chicago 2 - 4 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 2\n7. January 16: Phoenix 3 - 3 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 0 (tie, no gap)\n8. January 19: San Jose 2 - 1 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 1\n9. January 21: Anaheim 2 - 2 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 0 (tie, no gap)\n10. January 22: Los Angeles 4 - 5 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 1\n11. January 24: Phoenix 5 - 2 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 3\n12.

January 31: Carolina 4 - 4 Detroit \u2192 Point Gap = 0 (tie, no gap)\n\nNow, let's count the occurrences of each point gap:\n\n- Point Gap 0 (tie): Occurs 4 times (January 16, 21, 26, 31)\n- Point Gap 1: Occurs 3 times (January 10, 19, 22)\n- Point Gap 2: Occurs 2 times (January 3, 14)\n- Point Gap 3: Occurs 4 times (January 2, 7, 24, 29)\n- Point Gap 6: Occurs 1 time (January 5)\n\nThe largest point gap is 6, which occurs only once. The next largest point gap is 3, occurring four times. Therefore, there is no tie for the largest point gap.\n\nSince there is no tie for the largest point gap, the claim \"there be a tie for the largest point gap 2 time during the season\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
