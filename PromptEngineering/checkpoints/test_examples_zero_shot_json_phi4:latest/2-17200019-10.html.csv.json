    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table data, let's analyze each part of the claim step-by-step:\n\n1. **Claim about Belgian First Division Players:**\n   - The claim states that \"4 players from Belgian first division A be in the top 19 scorers.\"\n   - From the data, we can identify these players by checking their leagues and total goals:\n     - Thomas Chatelle (League: 4, Total: 4)\n     - Roland Juh\u00e1sz (League: 4, Total: 4)\n     - Stanislav Vl\u010dek (League: 4, Total: 4)\n\n   There are indeed three players from Belgian first division A in the top 19.\n\n2. **Claim about Top Scorer and Bart Goor's Goals:**\n   - The claim states that \"the top scorer (Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez) have 5 fewer goals than Bart Goor, who have 11 goals.\"\n   - From the data:\n     - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has a total of 3 goals.\n     - Bart Goor has a total of 1 goal.\n\n   Therefore, the statement that Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has 5 fewer goals than Bart Goor is incorrect. In fact, Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has more goals than Bart Goor.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because:\n- The number of Belgian first division A players in the top 19 is three, not four.\n- The comparison of goals between Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez and Bart Goor is incorrect.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
