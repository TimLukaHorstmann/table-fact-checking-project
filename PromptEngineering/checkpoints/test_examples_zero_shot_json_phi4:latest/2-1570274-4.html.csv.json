The specific focus of the claim is on his placements within the \"top - 5\" category for three tournaments: the Masters Tournament, the US Open, and The Open Championship.\n\nLet's break down the relevant details from the table:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**:\n   - In the row corresponding to the Masters Tournament (row index 0), the value in the \"top - 5\" column is 1. This indicates that Tony Lema finished in the top 5 once during the four events he participated in at this tournament.\n\n2. **US Open**:\n   - In the row for the US Open (row index 1), the value in the \"top - 5\" column is 2. This means that Tony Lema finished in the top 5 twice out of the six events he played in this tournament.\n\n3. **The Open Championship**:\n   - For The Open Championship (row index 2), the \"top - 5\" column shows a value of 2, indicating that Tony Lema achieved a top 5 finish two times across the three events he participated in for this championship.\n\nBased on these observations from the table:\n\n- **Masters Tournament**: Top 5 once\n- **US Open**: Top 5 twice\n- **The Open Championship**: Top 5 twice\n\nSince Tony Lema has been in the top 5 at least once for each of these tournaments (Masters, US Open, and The Open Championship), the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
