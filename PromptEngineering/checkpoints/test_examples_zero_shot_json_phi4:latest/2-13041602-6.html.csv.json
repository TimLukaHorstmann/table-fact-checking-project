A team has a winning record if the number of wins exceeds the number of losses.\n\nLet's examine the data:\n\n1. **August 2**: Record is \"52 - 55\". Losses exceed wins.\n2. **August 3**: Record is \"53 - 55\". Still losing more games than won.\n3. **August 4**: Record is \"54 - 55\". Nearly even, but still not a winning record.\n4. **August 5**: Record is \"55 - 55\". Even record (not winning).\n5. **August 6**: Record is \"55 - 56\". Losses increase.\n6. **August 7**: Record is \"56 - 56\". Even again.\n7. **August 8**: Record is \"56 - 57\". More losses.\n8. **August 9**: Record is \"56 - 58\". Increasing losses.\n9. **August 10**: Record is \"56 - 59\". Further increase in losses.\n10. **August 12**: Record is \"56 - 60\". Continues losing.\n11. **August 13**: Record is \"56 - 61\". More losses.\n12. **August 14**: Record is \"57 - 61\". First win after a streak of losses, but not yet winning record.\n13. **August 15**: Record is \"57 - 62\". Loses again.\n14. **August 16**: Record is \"58 - 62\". Wins back to one loss more than wins.\n15. **August 17**: Record is \"59 - 62\". Only two losses ahead.\n16. **August 18**: Record is \"60 - 62\". Closer, but still losing.\n17. **August 19**: Record is \"60 - 63\". More losses.\n18. **August 20**: Record is \"61 - 63\". Now only one loss more than wins.\n19. **August 21**: Record is \"61 - 64\". Again closer to a win-loss tie, but not winning yet.\n20. **August 23**: Record is \"62 - 64\". Approaching even record.\n21. **August 24**: Record is \"63 - 64\". Finally achieves a winning record with more wins than losses.\n22. **August 25**: Record is \"63 - 65\". Loses again, but had achieved a winning record previously on August 24.\n23. **August 26**: Record is \"64 - 65\". Back to winning record status after the win.\n24. **August 27**: Record is \"64 - 66\". Loss increases, yet they had periods of winning records.\n25. **August 28**: Record is \"64 - 67\". More losses.\n26. **August 30**: Record is \"64 - 68\". Continues losing streak.\n27. **August 31**: Record is \"65 - 68\". Ends with a closer win-loss record, but had winning records earlier.\n\nFrom the data analysis above, we can conclude that on August 24 and between August 26 to 25, the Brewers did have a winning record during August 2005.\n\nThus, the claim is false.
