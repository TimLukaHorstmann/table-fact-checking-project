    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of 8 year\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that the highest number of drop goals made by a single player occurred over an eight-year span. I need to check if any player in the table has both the highest number of drops and their career duration is at least eight years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details like start year, end year, starts, tries, conversions (conv), penalties (pens), and drop goals (drop). The 'span' column shows the time they were active.\n\nLet me go through each player's data:\n\n1. **Vaea Anitoni** (Row 1): Span is 1992-2000, which is exactly 8 years. His drop goals are 0.\n2. **Paul Emerick** (Row 2): Span from 2003 to 2012, that's 9 years. Drops: 0.\n3. **Todd Clever** (Row 3): Span is 2003 to present (assuming current year is after 2003). Let's say it's at least the time from 2003 onwards, but his drop goals are also 0.\n4. **Philip Eloff** (Row 4): Played from 2000-2007, which is 7 years. Drops: 0.\n5. **Takudzwa Ngwenya** (Row 5): Joined in 2007 and still active. So his span could be longer than eight years if the current year is beyond 2015. However, his drop goals are 0.\n6. **Chris Wyles** (Row 6): Joined in 2007, so depending on the current year, his span might be over eight years. His drops: 1.\n7. **David Fee** (Row 7): Active from 2002-2005, that's only 3 years. Drops: 0.\n8. **Mike Hercus** (Row 8): Played from 2002-2009, which is 7 years. His drop goals are 4.\n9. **Riaan Van Zyl** (Row 9): Only played in 2003-2004, so just 1 year. Drops: 0.\n\nNow, looking at the drop goals column:\n\nThe highest number of drops is 4 by Mike Hercus over a span of 7 years. The next closest is Chris Wyles with 1 drop. So, no one has more than 4 drop goals.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the greatest number... happen over the span of 8 year.\" Mike's span was 7 years, which is just shy of 8. Let me double-check each player's duration:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 1992-2000 \u2192 exactly 8 years.\n- Paul Emerick: 2003-2012 \u2192 that's 9 years (from 2003 to 2012 inclusive, so 10 years? Wait, 2012 - 2003 = 9 years. So actually, he played for 10 seasons if including both start and end years. Hmm, but the exact duration might be considered as years from start to finish. For example, 2003-2012 is a span of 10 years because each year counts individually.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that Mike Hercus has the most drops (4) but his span was 7 years, which is less than 8. Are there any other players with higher drops in an 8-year span?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 0 drops.\n- Paul Emerick: 0 drops over 9 years.\n- Todd Clever: 0 drops.\n- Philip Eloff: 0 drops in 7 years.\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 0 drops, but his span could be longer than 8 if current year is beyond 2015. However, he has 0 drops anyway.\n- Chris Wyles: 1 drop over at least 6 years (assuming from 2007 to present).\n- David Fee: Only 3 years and 0 drops.\n- Riaan Van Zyl: Just 1 year with 0 drops.\n\nSo the only player with a significant number of drops is Mike Hercus, but he didn't reach 8 years. The next is Chris Wyles with 1 drop over maybe 6+ years. No one else has more than that.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the greatest number (which would be 4) happened over an 8-year span isn't true because Mike's span was only 7 years. There's no player who had 4 drops over 8 years; the highest is 4 over 7 years and 1 over potentially longer.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"3 of the 9 players have not yet finished their span of play on the United States National Rugby Union team.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The table lists nine players with their respective spans (the years they played). The term \"span\" likely refers to the period during which a player was active with the team.\n\nThe claim is about whether three of these nine players have not yet finished their time on the team. In other words, their span hasn't ended yet\u2014they are still playing or haven't retired yet.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 1992 - 2000 \u2192 The span has a start and end year, so he's done.\n2. Paul Emerick: 2003 - 2012 \u2192 Similarly, both years are provided; he's finished.\n3. Todd Clever: 2003 - \u2192 The end year is missing (indicated by \"-\"), meaning he hasn't retired yet.\n4. Philip Eloff: 2000 - 2007 \u2192 Both years present; he has finished.\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007 - \u2192 End year missing, still active.\n6. Chris Wyles: 2007 - \u2192 No end year, still playing.\n7. David Fee: 2002 - 2005 \u2192 Both years given; finished.\n8. Mike Hercus: 2002 - 2009 \u2192 Both years present; done.\n9. Riaan van Zyl: 2003 - 2004 \u2192 Both years listed; he's finished.\n\nSo, looking at the spans:\n\n- Todd Clever (Row 3): 2003 -\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya (Row 5): 2007 -\n- Chris Wyles (Row 6): 2007 -\n\nThese three players have spans that end with a dash, indicating they're still active as of the latest data.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"Chris Wyles be 1 of the 2 player with drop during their time on the rugby team.\" So, the claim is saying that Chris Wyles is one out of two players who had a 'drop' during their time on the team. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player and includes stats like starts, tries, conversions (conv), penalties (pens), and drops. The 'drop' column likely refers to drop goals or some similar stat.\n\nI need to check which players have a non-zero value in the 'drop' column because that indicates they had a drop during their time.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: drop is 0.\n2. Paul Emerick: drop is 0.\n3. Todd Clever: drop is 0.\n4. Philip Eloff: drop is 0.\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: drop is 0.\n6. Chris Wyles: drop is 1. So he has one drop.\n7. David Fee: drop is 0.\n8. Mike Hercus: drop is 4. That's more than zero.\n9. Riaan van Zyl: drop is 0.\n\nSo, from the table, only two players have a non-zero 'drop' value: Chris Wyles with 1 and Mike Hercus with 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Chris Wyles is one of the two players with drops is correct because there are exactly two players (Chris Wyles and Mike Hercus) who have drop goals. \n\nTo confirm, I should list the relevant cells that support this.

The claim says: \"riann van zyl have the shortest time span on the united state national rugby union team and tie with 3 others for the smallest number of tries.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Riaan Van Zyl has the shortest time span.\n2. He ties with three others for the smallest number of tries.\n\nLet me check each part step by step.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each player's span and tries. \n\nFor the first part: The time spans vary. Let's list all players' spans:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n- Paul Emerick: 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n- Todd Clever: 2003 - present (assuming current year is beyond 2003, let's say at least X years)\n- Philip Eloff: 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007 - present\n- Chris Wyles: 2007 - present\n- David Fee: 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n- Mike Hericus: 2002 - 2009 (7 years)\n- Riaan Van Zyl: 2003 - 2004 (1 year)\n\nSo, the shortest span is definitely Riaan Van Zyl with only one year. That part checks out.\n\nNow, for the second part: The smallest number of tries. Let's list each player's tries:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 26\n- Paul Emerick: 17\n- Todd Clever: 11\n- Philip Eloff: 10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10\n- Chris Wyles: 10\n- David Fee: 9\n- Mike Hericus: 9\n- Riaan Van Zyl: 9\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 1: tries:26\nRow 2:17\nRow3:11\nRow4:10\nRow5:10\nRow6:10\nRow7:9\nRow8:9\nRow9:9\n\nWait, Riaan Van Zyl is row9, with tries=9.\n\nSo the players with 9 tries are:\n\n- David Fee (row7)\n- Mike Hericus (row8)\n- Riaan Van Zyl (row9)\n\nThat's three others. So he ties with them for the smallest number of tries. But wait, Chris Wyles has 10, which is more than 9.\n\nWait no, actually, let me list all tries:\n\nRow1:26\nRow2:17\nRow3:11\nRow4:10\nRow5:10\nRow6:10 (Chris Wyles)\nRow7:9 (David Fee)\nRow8:9 (Mike Hericus)\nRow9:9 (Riaan Van Zyl)\n\nSo the smallest number of tries is 9, achieved by David Fee, Mike Hericus, and Riaan Van Zyl. That's three others? Wait, no\u2014Van Zyl is one, so he ties with two others. The claim says \"tie with 3 others,\" but actually, it's three players in total (including himself) or excluding?\n\nWait, the wording: \"tie with 3 others.\" So if Van Zyl is one, and there are three others, that would make four people with the same number of tries.\n\nBut looking at the data, only three have 9 tries: rows7,8,9. So including Van Zyl, it's three players total. So he ties with two others. Therefore, the claim says \"tie with 3 others,\" which is incorrect because there are only two others (David Fee and Mike Hericus). So that part of the claim is false.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nPlayers with tries=9: row7 (Fee), row8 (Hericus), row9 (Van Zyl) \u2192 three players. So Van Zyl ties with two others. The claim says he ties with 3 others, which would mean four people in total. That's not the case.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim is incorrect because Riaan only ties with two others for the smallest number of tries, not three.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: Riaan Van Zyl having the shortest span (TRUE) and tying with three others in tries (FALSE). Since both parts must be true for the claim to hold, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Paul emerick do not have fewer tries than any other player\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what this claim means.\n\nThe claim says that Paul Emerick does not have fewer tries than any other player. So, in other words, for every other player in the table, Paul Emerick's number of tries is either equal to or greater than theirs. If that's the case, then the claim would be true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are nine players listed. Each row has information about each player, including their starts and tries. The relevant columns here are \"player\" and \"tries\". \n\nFirst, let me note down Paul Emerick's data. From Row 2: his span is 2003-2012, starts at 49, and tries are 17. So his number of tries is 17.\n\nNow I need to check each player's tries and see if any of them have more than 17 tries because the claim states that Paul doesn't have fewer tries than anyone else. If even one player has more than 17, then Paul does have fewer tries than that player, making the claim false. Conversely, if all other players have 17 or fewer tries, the claim would be true.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni with 26 tries. Wait, 26 is more than 17. So this means Paul has fewer tries than Vaea. That already contradicts the claim because the claim says he doesn't have fewer tries than any other player.\n\nBut let me double-check to be thorough. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nRow 3: Todd Clever with 11 tries \u2013 less than 17.\nRow 4: Philip Eloff with 10 tries \u2013 less.\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya with 10 tries \u2013 also less.\nRow 6: Chris Wyles with 10 tries \u2013 same as above.\nRow 7: David Fee with 9 tries \u2013 less.\nRow 8: Mike Hercus with 9 tries \u2013 less. Wait, but actually, looking at Row 8 again, Mike Hercus has starts at 45 and tries at 9? No, wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check all rows.\n\nWait, no. For each player:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: tries =26\n- Paul Emerick: 17\n- Todd Clever:11\n- Philip Eloff:10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya:10\n- Chris Wyles:10\n- David Fee:9\n- Mike Hercus: starts at 45, but tries=9?\nWait, no. Let me check again:\n\nRow 8 says: player: mike hercus, span:2002-2009, start:45, tries:9, conv:90, pens:76, drop:4.\n\nYes, so Mike Hercus has 9 tries. \n\nBut wait, in Row 1, Vaea Anitoni has 26 tries. So Paul Emerick's 17 is less than 26. That means there is at least one player (Vaea) who has more tries than Paul, which makes the claim false because Paul does have fewer tries than someone.\n\nSo the relevant cells are Paul Emerick's tries and Vaea Anitoni's tries. \n\nTherefore, since Paul has fewer tries than Vaea, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Paul Emerick has 17 tries, which is less than Vaea Anitoni's 26 tries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of only 1 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Greatest number of drops**: This refers to the highest value in the 'drop' column among all players.\n2. **From 1 player**: We're looking for a single player who has this maximum drop count.\n3. **Over the span of only 1 year**: The time frame during which these drops occurred is just one year.\n\nNow, let's examine the table provided. Each row represents a player with their respective statistics, including 'start', 'tries', 'conv', 'pens', and 'drop'. The relevant columns for this claim are 'span' (to determine the duration) and 'drop' (the number of drops).\n\nLooking at each player:\n\n- **Vaea Anitoni**: Played from 1992 to 2000, which is a span of 8 years. His drop count is 0.\n- **Paul Emerick**: From 2003 to 2012 (9 years). Drops: 0.\n- **Todd Clever**: 2003 onwards; as of the data, his span hasn't ended yet. Drops: 0.\n- **Philip Eloff**: 2000 to 2007 (7 years). Drops: 0.\n- **Takudzwa Ngwenya**: Started in 2007 and is still active; drops: 0.\n- **Chris Wyles**: Joined in 2007, with a drop count of 1. His span is from 2007 onwards, which could be more than one year if he's still playing.\n- **David Fee**: Played from 2002 to 2005 (3 years). Drops: 0.\n- **Mike Hercus**: Active from 2002 to 2009 (7 years). Drops: 4. So, he has the highest drop count so far with 4 drops over 7 years.\n- **Riaan van Zyl**: Only played from 2003 to 2004, which is exactly one year. His drop count is 0.\n\nWait a minute, Mike Hercus has 4 drops over 7 years. Is there anyone else with more? No, Chris Wyles has only 1 drop. Todd Clever and others have zero. So the maximum number of drops from a single player is 4, done by Mike Hercus over 7 years.\n\nNow, does the claim say that this maximum happened in just one year? The claim states \"the greatest number of drop... happen over the span of only 1 year.\" \n\nLooking at Mike Hercus's data: he played for 7 years and had 4 drops. That means on average, less than a drop per year. However, there might be variability each season or year. But in the table provided, we don't have yearly breakdowns\u2014only total stats.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about whether the greatest number of drops happened over only one year. The maximum drop count is 4, and if those 4 drops occurred within a single year, then the claim would be TRUE. However, based on the data given, we don't have information about how these drops are distributed across the years.\n\nBut looking at Mike Hercus's span: 2002-2009 is more than one year, so unless all his 4 drops happened in a single season within those years, we can't confirm that. However, without specific yearly data, we have to assume that the total drops are spread over multiple years.\n\nMoreover, let's check if any other player has their 'drop' count within a span of just one year. Looking at Riaan van Zyl: he played from 2003-2004, which is exactly one year. But his drop count is 0. The next possible candidate could be Chris Wyles, who has 1 drop but his span is from 2007 onwards\u2014could be more than one year.\n\nWait, Mike Hercus's span is longer than one year, so even if he had all drops in a single year within that span, the table doesn't provide that level of detail. Therefore, we can't confirm whether any player achieved their maximum drop count in just one year because the data doesn't specify yearly breakdowns.\n\nHowever, another approach: maybe Mike Hercus's 4 drops occurred over 7 years, so it's less than a drop per year on average. But is there any player with more drops? No, he has the highest. So if all his drops happened in one year, then that would be the case. But without knowing that, we can't assume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to whether someone achieved their maximum drops within a single season (one year). Since Mike's total is 4 over 7 years, unless he had 4 drops in one season and none in others, which isn't indicated, but without that info, we can't be certain. \n\nWait, but the table only gives total stats per player across their entire span. So for each player, 'drop' is a cumulative number across all seasons they played.\n\nTherefore, to assess if any player had their maximum drops (which is 4) occur in just one year, we would need yearly data. Since that's not provided, the claim can't be supported by the given table because even though Mike Hercus has the highest drop count of 4, his span was more than a year, and we don't know how those drops were distributed.\n\nSo, the claim is about whether the maximum number of drops from one player happened in just one year. Since the data only shows totals without yearly breakdowns, we can't confirm that any player's maximum drop count occurred within a single year. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that the highest number of drops (4) by Mike Hercus occurred over a single year. However, since the table only provides cumulative stats without yearly breakdowns, we can't confirm if those 4 drops happened in one year or spread across his 7-year span. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"claim\": \"The greatest number of drops by any player occurred over a single year.\",\n  \"supported\": false,\n  \"reasoning\": \"While Mike Hercus has the highest drop count of 4, his active years spanned more than one season.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states that all players have already finished their span of play on the United States National Rugby Union team.\n\nFirst, let me look at each player's span in the table. \n\nLooking at Row 1: Vaea Anitoni has a span from 1992 to 2000, which is clearly in the past.\nRow 2: Paul Emerick played from 2003 to 2012, also finished.\nRow 3: Todd Clever's span is listed as 2003 to -, which means he might still be playing. The dash suggests that his time hasn't ended yet.\nRow 4: Philip Eloff was active from 2000 to 2007, so that's done.\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya has a span of 2007 to -, indicating he might still be playing or it's ongoing.\nRow 6: Chris Wyles is also listed as 2007 to -, which could mean his time isn't over yet.\nRow 7: David Fee played from 2002 to 2005, so that's finished.\nRow 8: Mike Hercus was active until 2009, so he has finished.\nRow 9: Riaan van Zyl played from 2003 to 2004, which is in the past.\n\nThe claim says \"all\" players have finished. But Todd Clever, Takudzwa Ngwenya, and Chris Wyles have spans ending with a dash, implying their involvement might still be current or ongoing as of the data's last update. Therefore, not all players have necessarily finished their span.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because there are players whose spans haven't ended yet.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE since some players have ongoing spans indicated by '-' in their end years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"chris wyles be the only player with drop during his time on the rugby team.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. The claim is saying that Chris Wyles is the only player who had any drop goals during his time on the team. So I need to check if any other players besides Chris have a value in the 'drop' column greater than zero.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Vaea Anitoni, drop is 0.\n- Row 2: Paul Emerick, drop is 0.\n- Row 3: Todd Clever, drop is 0.\n- Row 4: Philip Eloff, drop is 0.\n- Row 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya, drop is 0.\n- Row 6: Chris Wyles, drop is 1. So he has one drop goal.\n- Row 7: David Fee, drop is 0.\n- Row 8: Mike Hericus, drop is 4. Wait, that's four drop goals.\n- Row 9: Riaan van Zyl, drop is 0.\n\nWait a minute, so Mike Hercus has four drop goals, which is more than zero. That means Chris Wyles isn't the only one with a drop; Mike also has some. Therefore, the claim that Chris is the only player with drops is FALSE because Mike Hericus also has drop goals.\n\nSo, I should mark this as FALSE and point out both relevant cells: Chris's row where drop is 1 and Mike's row where drop is 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Chris Wyles is the sole player with a drop goal. However, Mike Hericus also has four drop goals. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nThe claim states: \"Riann van zyl have the longest time span on the United State National Rugby Union team and tie with only 1 other player for the greatest number of tries.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the two parts of the claim:\n\n1. **Longest Time Span**: We need to check who has the longest span in the \"span\" column.\n2. **Greatest Number of Tries (Ties)**: Check if Riaan van Zyl ties with only one other player for the most tries.\n\nLet's start by examining each row to find out the spans and the number of tries.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Vaea Anitoni, span 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n- Row 2: Paul Emerick, span 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n- Row 3: Todd Clever, span 2003 - present (assuming current year is after 2023, so over 20 years)\n- Row 4: Philip Eloff, span 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n- Row 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya, span 2007 - present (over 16 years as of 2023)\n- Row 6: Chris Wyles, span 2007 - present (similar to above)\n- Row 7: David Fee, span 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n- Row 8: Mike Hercus, span 2002 - 2009 (7 years)\n- Row 9: Riaan van Zyl, span 2003 - 2004 (1 year)\n\nSo, the longest spans are Todd Clever and Takudzwa Ngwenya with over 20 and 16 years respectively. However, the claim is about Riaan van Zyl having the longest span, which isn't true since his span is only from 2003 to 2004.\n\nNext, checking for the number of tries:\n\n- Row 1: Vaea Anitoni - 26 tries\n- Row 2: Paul Emerick - 17 tries\n- Row 3: Todd Clever - 11 tries\n- Row 4: Philip Eloff - 10 tries\n- Row 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya - 10 tries\n- Row 6: Chris Wyles - 10 tries\n- Row 7: David Fee - 9 tries\n- Row 8: Mike Hercus - 9 tries\n- Row 9: Riaan van Zyl - 9 tries\n\nVaea Anitoni has the highest with 26 tries. Riaan van Zyl has only 9 tries, which is far less than Anitoni and even others. Therefore, he doesn't tie for the greatest number of tries; instead, there's a single player (Anitoni) with the most.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are incorrect\u2014Riaan van Zyl neither has the longest time span nor does he tie for the most tries\u2014the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Riaan van Zyl does not have the longest time span, and his number of tries isn't tied with only one other player.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
